          <p eId="para_1">Members will be aware that last weekend marked the 90th anniversary commemoration of the Holodomor famine in the Ukraine during which many millions died. On the initiative of the Ceann Comhairle, it has been decided to have a minute's silence. I invite Members during that minute's silence to take cognisance of the fact since May of this year, estimates of the number of people across the world who will experience crisis levels of hunger in 2022 has risen from 181 million people in 41 countries to 345 million. The G7 states that 323 million people are on the brink of starvation. One person was dying from hunger every 48 seconds in May; it is now one every 36 seconds. In that context, I ask Members to stand for a minute's silence to commemorate a specific famine.</p>

          <p eId="para_2">Here we go again. With less than three weeks to go before the Taoiseach hands the keys of his office back to the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, the Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has opened the door to the return of big pay for top bankers. This move will pave the way for bumper pay increases for the top brass at bailed-out banks. We are talking about senior banking executives who already earn €500,000. It seems former Fine Gael Ministers who slipped out of government and into the roles of banking lobbyists have done their job very well.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">Nobody should be surprised because this is straight out of the Fine Gael playbook - delivering for those in high places while ordinary people struggle to make ends meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">This would be a bad call at any time, but there is something twisted about allowing big pay hikes for wealthy bankers while workers and families endure an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis. It is a real kick in the teeth for ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> There was a segment on RTÉ radio this morning, which was absolutely heart-breaking. It contained interviews with people who now rely on food banks to ensure that they and their children get a decent meal. One woman spoke about how she will have to go into debt on household bills in order to ensure that her kids have a nice Christmas. Is that not an awful dilemma for any parent? However, that is the reality of what people are facing as Fine Gael prepares to resume leadership of the Government by looking after the top brass in the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> We have all been here before. We have seen where gratuitous pay of bankers and the self-serving behaviour of big banks led us before. It led us to financial disaster, economic crash and social catastrophe. For the banks, it meant an enormous rescue package funded out of public moneys to the tune of €45 billion. For workers and families, it meant austerity. For the most vulnerable, it meant the most vicious of cuts. Fine Gael took away the respite care and bereavement grants and cut child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> After all the damage was done, did the banks learn their lesson? Did they hell. No, they did not. We only need to look at the tracker mortgage scandal, with thousands overcharged for their mortgages. Hundreds of people lost their homes and lives were destroyed as a result. Even when the banks were caught red-handed, they continued to do harm. This year alone, AIB and Bank of Ireland were fined over €197 million for regulatory breaches and actions that led to families losing their homes. The tracker mortgage scandal is not distant history; it happened in recent years. To this day, not one banker has been held accountable for this scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Buille uafásach is ea cinneadh an Aire, an Teachta Donohoe, chun pá mór a cheadú do bhaincéirí, d’oibrithe agus do theaghlaigh atá ag streachailt chun teacht i dtír. Níor cheart leis dul ar aghaidh. The Minister for Finance's decision is essentially to reward top bankers despite all the damage that was done. He is clearly completely out of touch with what ordinary people are going through. Fine Gael is clearly out of touch with all of that. My question is simple. Why is the Taoiseach going along with this? How can he defend it? How can he tell those struggling to heat their homes or put food on the table that a banker’s salary of €500,000 is not enough?</p>

          <p eId="para_10">In the first instance, the outcome of the retail banking review is an important piece of work. It contains 34 recommendations. We have gone from 13 retail banks down to three. The banking landscape has changed dramatically. The report is worth reading, and the Deputy should read it in its entirety. There are very interesting recommendations, including recommending that Government would put into legislation that citizens would have access to cash. In other words, that there would be a legislative obligation on banks to ensure access to cash for citizens. Some extremely interesting surveys were done into how people want access to cash even though they are using more digital mechanisms. This, of course, relates to the retail banking network and the availability of ATMs. It is a very important outcome of this review, along with consumer protection and the competition issue, the future of banking and changing technology in banks. The non-bank sector is an issue we have to address. These are all recommendations that have emanated from here.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">The Opposition has decided to deal with only one item. The review recommends the introduction of variable pay of up to €20,000 and for the provision of standard non-pay benefits for all employees in the three banks. There are 20,000 people working in the three retail banks. Why is the Opposition, including Sinn Féin, against ordinary workers in the banking sector from getting a pay rise? That is what the Deputy is saying and that is what she said this morning. If anybody is trying to kick the teeth of anybody else, she is kicking the teeth of the ordinary bank workers of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">John O’Connell, the general secretary of the union for workers in the banks, is saying very clearly that the lifting of the restrictions on variable pay and benefits will benefit ordinary bank staff. That is what he is saying and that is clear. Restrictions are causing difficulties with staff recruitment and retention especially in the new critical areas of IT and cybersecurity. Remember that the HSE is now estimating that the cybersecurity attack on its operations last year will potentially cost up to €100 million in the areas of compliance and legal functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> They are competing with big banks in the international and financial services sector for many of these staff. It is interesting that nearly one third of workers who are leaving banks indicate that reward is a key reason for quitting. Between 40% and 45% of workers in the sector who have left have received variable pay as part of their package with their new employer. All of this is in the review. That is a key issue that the Deputy has simply ignored because she thinks that it plays well for her electorally just to talk about the top brass, the big banker-----</p>

          <p eId="para_16">-----and to keep the debate at that level, but not to look more seriously at the issues that the review brings out.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> There are 34 recommendations in this review. It has changed dramatically. Parallel with that, last week, the Government published the credit union Bill. The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has done excellent work in this regard. This review states that the credit union has significant potential now in terms of mortgages, small and medium sized businesses, SMEs, and other issues. That is the <i>raison d’être</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In terms of the Bank of Ireland and the restriction on the higher level of remuneration, that bank is now completely independent of the Government and it has paid back everything that it was given by the Government. It is independent of the Government. We are not giving anyone any pay at all.</p>

The culture has not changed one iota within the Irish banking system. I have asked the Taoiseach on that issue how he stands behind that. How does he defend that?

          <p eId="para_54">As Deputy Micheál Martin prepares to leave the office of Taoiseach, it is an appropriate time to reflect on his tenure in office. He has repeatedly said he considers housing the most important social issue in the country but his record tells a different story. It is not a record of problem solving; it is a record of problems multiplying.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The crisis has now morphed into a disaster. The facts speak for themselves. House prices, rents and the rate of homelessness have never been higher. On Friday, we learned that there are now a record 11,397 people, including 3,480 children, living in emergency accommodation. The housing emergency is not always just about bricks and mortar. The price of the disaster is being paid by these thousands of children, many of whom are not meeting milestones, who are losing their childhoods as they grow up in emergency accommodation. Homelessness has almost become normalised. The price is also being paid by the relationships breaking down because of the stress of housing insecurity, by the couples postponing having a family and by the disconnected communities resulting from people being unable to put down roots.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> When is this going to end or, at the very least, when are we going to see some tangible improvements? The thousands of people who took to the streets for the Raise the Roof rally on Saturday do not see any evidence that the Taoiseach's Government is treating this crisis as an emergency. I met teachers at the protest who can no longer afford to live in Dublin or other cities and who have no option but to leave the profession or leave the country. It is the same story for workers in other sectors. Our very significant skills shortage is partly a result of this. Who can afford to spend an astronomical €28,000 per annum in rent to live in Dublin or in excess of €20,000 to live in other parts of the country? Pretty soon, the only people who will be able to afford rent in this country will be bankers, who are to see their gold-plated €20,000 bonuses restored with the decision made by Government today.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The Taoiseach is delivering for the bankers but what about the workers in sectors that did not have any hand, act or part in collapsing the housing sector? All they hear from the Taoiseach is broken promises. He says housing is his top priority and yet 11 local authorities failed to deliver a single new-build home in the first half of 2022. Not a single such home was constructed in six months in vast swathes of the country during the biggest housing crisis in a generation. This 11 includes three local authorities in Dublin, where the crisis is at its most acute. Meanwhile, nearly €500 million of the Government's housing budget for the first nine months of this year was not spent. It should be no surprise then that the Government will miss its modest target to build 4,100 affordable and cost rental homes this year. Talk is cheap and the Taoiseach's commitments on housing now lie in tatters. Does he accept that his tenure has been a failure when it comes to housing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_46">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T14:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_58">No, I do not. Some very fundamental decisions have been taken that have changed the momentum in respect of housing for the next decade. We are already on track to exceed this year's target of 24,600 under Housing for All. We need to consider that we had two significant lockdowns during the Covid pandemic, which dominated the first year and a half to two years of this Government. Despite the inflationary cycle, the war in Ukraine and the exponential increase in the cost of building materials as we came out of the pandemic, we have continued with new schemes and new approaches and with record legislation in the field of housing. Seventeen Acts in this area have been enacted since this Government came into office. This includes major legislation such as the Land Development Agency Act 2021, which is going to be there for the long term. We have already seen the work of this agency in Shanganagh. Some in the Opposition voted against that but, as of last week, there are now 600 units under way because of the Land Development Agency and the Act establishing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">The Affordable Housing Act established the affordable housing purchase scheme. The sixth Residential Tenancies Act enhances tenant protections, including the introduction of a 2% rent cap, extended rent pressure zones, RPZs, until the end of 2024, restricted deposits in the context of what landlords can do with deposits, extended notice to quit periods, the winter eviction ban, and a whole range of legislative elements. The help to buy scheme is now a maximum payment of €30,000. This scheme has helped thousands of ordinary people to buy their first home. This year we have had a record 16,000 first-time buyers in the past 12 months. That is the highest number since 2007, which represents 33% of all home purchases, up from 25% in 2015. With social housing, again we are looking at a record this year in the number of social houses that will be brought in through build, lease and acquisition.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> About 18,500 social houses have been provided since this Government came into office. This is very significant ramping up of activity on the social housing front. We can also add in 5,000 units in voids that we brought back in. We are producing additional housing. The issue for us is that we need to produce more and we need to produce housing more rapidly. This means more rapid build. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is focusing on that aspect of it now, particularly on public lands, so we can get more rapid-build social housing into play. We are also increasing the supports for homeownership. On top of the help to buy scheme we have the first home scheme, which is at about 700 approvals already. Project Tosaigh, from the Land Development Agency, is also targeting some 5,000 units with existing planning permissions on the private side, which it is hoping to bring into operation to create affordable housing for people. There is a lot of activity there. It is about supply and is about trying to get delivery faster.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">The Taoiseach said nothing about the 11,397 people who are in homeless and emergency accommodation, including almost 3,500 children who will spend this Christmas in homeless accommodation. It has almost become permanent. It has become normalised. We get these figures on a Friday towards the end of each month and each time they are going up. We have seen a reduction in commencements in the past three months, with no local authority new builds in the first six months of this year in 11 local authorities. It does not suggest an emergency. The facts are we have the highest rents and the cost of buying a house has never been higher. We have lots of targets, but people cannot live in targets and they cannot rent targets. They need to see that, in this crisis, the Government is delivering as if it were an emergency and where we are actually seeing the results on the ground. People are losing hope. We could certainly see this on Saturday when talking to people at the demonstration.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">We need more supply to deal with that. That is why we have ramped up social housing supply very significantly - to deal with the issue of homelessness and the waiting lists for people who are trying to get social housing. This is why we have ramped it up, and it is up significantly. Consider the numbers of workers who are working in construction. There are 40,000 more people working in construction this year than last year, which is 20,000 more than in 2019. This also shows that we are doing everything we possibly can to ramp up capacity within the construction sector in order that we can build more homes. Ultimately, it is about supply. We also have the winter eviction ban to try to reduce homelessness during the winter period.</p>

          <p eId="para_72"> To date, Unite the Union water service workers have rejected the plan by 82%, and 96% of water service workers in the Connect trade union have balloted to take industrial action if the date and wording for a referendum to enshrine the public ownership and management of water and sanitation services in the Constitution are not initiated. They want to keep the full terms and conditions they have with the local authorities. They want honoured their rostered overtime and allowances, which impact their future pensions. They want that red-circled. They want public service status protected. The water service workers in SIPTU and Fórsa have not been balloted, and I hope the Taoiseach will agree that this is a democratic deficit for those workers. They were promised that a referendum would be passed before any transfer of workers to Irish Water and that such a transfer would take place in 2026. In the WRC framework agreement, there is no mention of a referendum and the date has been brought forward by three years to 1 January 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, stated in a letter to me that he will bring forward definitive proposals on a referendum on water ownership for consideration early in the new year. That is not good enough. It is too vague and it still kicks the can down the road. We have had too many delays. In November 2018, the then Minister, Eoghan Murphy, announced he was to seek approval for such a referendum. That was two years after the Bill I introduced in 2016, and we are still waiting six years on for that proposal to go to the Cabinet. The Bill was unopposed and the framework plan has been brought forward by three years, from 2026 to 2023. The Bill I proposed on behalf of the huge Right2Water campaign is sitting on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach will be aware of that Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The Taoiseach's party claims to support a referendum, so it should prove it and ensure water and sanitation do not remain in public ownership in name only, with the majority of services outsourced to private companies on long-term contracts. I have seen many Ministers clamour to bring legislation to the Cabinet before the D-day of 17 December. Will the Taoiseach instruct his Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to bring a wording and the date for a referendum to his Cabinet before 17 December?</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. Transfers to Irish Water of water services workers under the framework for future delivery of water services, which was identified, as the Deputy will know, at the Workplace Relations Commission on 24 June of this year, are voluntary. Every worker will have the option of staying with his or her local authority, and transfers will happen over a four-year period, from 2023 to 2026, inclusive. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage hosted parallel engagement with the unions on a number of policy matters of relevance to staff in the context of the water transformation programme, including a referendum on water ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> A paper entitled Irish Water Transformation: The Wider Policy Context was shared with the unions in July of this year to reflect the engagement outcomes. That paper set out the planned approach to bring forward a referendum proposal on water ownership for consideration by the Government in conjunction with the anticipated recommendation of a proposed referendum on housing from the Housing Commission. In that way it is intended that definitive proposals, including timelines for referendums on water and housing, in line with the commitments given in the programme for Government, will be considered by the Government in the near future. I hope we will have recommendations by the end of the year in order that the Minister will be in the position to act on this early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> In that context the process that has been entered into is a positive one, and the policy paper reflected all of that in respect of Irish Water separating from the Ervia group during 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is due to conclude in the Oireachtas on Thursday. Seanad Report and Final Stages will provide for the separation. Irish Water will then integrate the day-to-day operations in the delivery of water services into its own organisational structures in place of the current service level agreements. In many ways, that will make for a better delivery of water services.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> The referendum has been committed to. The Housing Commission is working on those issues. During the debates in the House and so on, we acknowledged that the constitutional referendum emerged as a key concern. The Government intends to act on that with legislation. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has signalled his willingness to support that referendum on the ownership of water and to hold it in conjunction with a referendum on housing once the recommendation from the Housing Commission comes forward, hopefully towards the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">We have been waiting for a referendum and a wording to come forward for six years. It has been six months since the policy document was published and we still await wording and a date. It is an absolute disgrace. I have received correspondence from water service workers. They say they want a referendum now. The wording must be that the ownership of water and water service are to remain public. Terms and conditions of local authority water workers do not include allowances and regular and rostered overtime. Allowances and regular rostered overtime and on-call allowance must be red-circled in the water framework document. Those allowances are pensionable. They can stay in the local authority but they may not be in the same position. They might be in parks or maintenance and they are not carrying their rostered overtime and the pensionable allowances. They want that red-circled and put in the framework plan and they want a referendum now.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> One of the workers told me to tell the Minister to make no mistake: if he tries to force the framework plan on the workers, he will be met with massive nationwide industrial action. We need a referendum on the public ownership now. That is their message to the Government. </p>

          <p eId="para_93">In the past two years, I have raised over 50 questions of serious national west Cork concerns. Looking back, I must say many of these issues got worse rather than better under his leadership. I noticed some of the same frustration we experience in west Cork at the launch of Councillor Shane P. O'Reilly's campaign for the Rural Independent Group in the next general election in Cavan-Monaghan. A packed room vented its anger at the Government and gave us and Councillor O'Reilly a clear mandate. I will go back two and a half years. The first for the chop under the Taoiseach's guidance was the fishing industry. It is almost destroyed with his acceptance of a shocking Brexit deal, plus sea fisheries penalty points that he signed into law, as well as an inability to fight for any extra quota, not even bluefin tuna, when the rest of Europe has that quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I have raised the farming crisis. The Government is asleep at the wheel. It has seen the destruction of farm incomes as it ploughs ahead with this ludicrous Green Party policy of cutting the national herd, as well as applying carbon tax on farm fuel, thus crippling the farming sector. I raised our energy independence and the over-reliance on the UK for our fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">I spoke to the Taoiseach about the possibility of exploring for our own fuel off Barryroe and a floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal of Cork Harbour, only to be met with deaf ears. I also spoke to the Taoiseach about people who were waiting for five years in Cork for operations such as cataract operations. Two and a half years later, people of Cork city and county must still wait for five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> I raised the closure of Bank of Ireland banks in Bantry and Dunmanway and post offices such as that in Goleen in west Cork but nothing has happened. They closed. Castletownbere, Dunmanway and Kinsale banks almost went cashless under the Taoiseach's watch until the Rural Independent Group stepped in and put a stop to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Bantry General Hospital is always a great concern of my constituents. The new accident and emergency unit was closed to the public for close to a month and not a sod has been turned on the ever-promised endoscopy unit or stroke unit in the Taoiseach’s term. His only visit to the hospital was overshadowed by the announcement days later that seven beds were to be closed in the mental health unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> I have also raised the issues of funding for Keelbeg Pier, Union Hall; a stand-alone statue in Dublin to remember General Michael Collins; the closure of CoAction houses in Castletownbere; a helicopter service for Dursey Island, as people have no fresh food there; water shortages in Clonakilty; and the crisis in the ambulance service for patients and staff. I have raised all these during the Taoiseach’s term but my calls have fallen on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> On 2 June 2021, I raised the All-Island Research Observatory, AIRO, report, compiled by Cork County Council. This independent report showed that Cork county was 52 years behind other counties in respect of funding under the local improvement scheme, LIS, and CLÁR, in addition to funding for roads and rural regeneration. The report found that Cork county was the county fourth from the bottom in getting LEADER funding in spite of its being the largest in the country. To address this independent report, I pleaded with the Taoiseach in June 2021 to meet the then Fianna Fáil mayor, Councillor Gillian Coughlan, to address this astonishing shortfall affecting the county. To my astonishment, neither the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, nor the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, ever met the council to discuss and address this critical independent report on Cork county, which, if acted upon, could help bring the funding level of Cork county up to that of the rest of Ireland. Why has the Taoiseach not met Cork County Council to address this report during his term?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_100">I thank the Deputy for raising those issues. The country has enjoyed full employment for the past two years, having come out of Covid. West Cork has not been immune from this. Agricultural incomes have gone up over recent years, despite what the Deputy said. They went up significantly last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> I was in Ringaskiddy at the weekend, on Saturday. The Mayor of the County of Cork was present also. He would have witnessed the transformation in the community centre in the town, reflecting the strong spirit of the community and the strong LEADER grant of about €300,000 that was responsible for the transformation of the centre. It is carbon neutral and highly energy efficient, and it has a wonderful room. This is really an illustration of the transformation that has happened not only across west Cork but across the rest of rural Ireland regarding the allocation of substantial funding and working opportunities created within community centres. The Ringaskiddy centre is just one example of where a significant sum was made available. A sum of €379 million has been allocated since 2020 by the Department of Rural and Community Development to projects under the rural regeneration and development fund. The Deputy did not mention that once in his commentary. It was almost as if he did not see any of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> The outdoor recreation and infrastructure scheme should also be acknowledged, along with the public-realm work that is ongoing in many areas across west Cork, CLÁR, the town and village renewal scheme and the local improvement scheme, but the Deputy simply ignored them all. It is as if they never happened, even though the Deputy was agitating a lot for the funding and ringing up Departments, county councils and everybody to get a slice of the action. That is no harm, and I do not have any issue with the Deputy doing that, but he will endeavour, as usual, to claim credit for it over Government Deputy Christopher O’Sullivan or somebody else like that.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">The Deputy should talk to the Mayor of the County of Cork. He is opening a lot of developments. The urban relief road in Carrigaline has been transformative in addressing the congestion there. It gives very quick access to Minane and places further along. We will seek further improvements to the LEADER and CLÁR programmes, but the Deputy must surely acknowledge the additional funding that was earmarked for projects right across west Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The Croí Cónaithe towns fund will be useful for any vacant property refurbishment that is required. Towns to the west could benefit from substantial grants under the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">People could establish homes and live in them. They could benefit from significant grants from the Croí Cónaithe towns fund, which can go from €30,000 to €50,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and trek around Ringaskiddy and Carrigaline in his own constituency, where all of the projects he has spoken about are happening. Nothing much has happened in west Cork during the Taoiseach's run. I asked him about the AIRO report and why he did not meet with the council. He refused to answer and continues to refuse to meet the council. His inability to address the independent report that shows quite clearly that Cork county is an astonishing 52 years behind at all State funding levels has left Cork County Council with no choice but to raise rates for hard-pressed businesses by 3.5% yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> The Taoiseach had almost two years to deal with the report but chose, for whatever reason, to turn a blind eye to it; the same blind eye he turned towards roads in west Cork. As a leader from Cork, I had some hope that the Taoiseach would have seen the desperate need for a bypass in Innishannon and the finishing of the southern bypass in Bandon, as well as progressing plans for the northern relief road in Bandon, coupled with the Bantry relief road, but nothing has happened other than pothole repair on these vital roads. On the N71 from Bandon to Clonakilty and Clonakilty to Skibbereen, people can spend 20 to 30 minutes behind a lorry or a tractor, as the plea for funding for simple passing bays fell on deaf ears. After two and a half years as leader of our country, what will the Taoiseach's legacy be for the people of west Cork? I can see little or none.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">There has been a 50% increase in LEADER funding for west Cork and Cork county in general. The Deputy knows about the Bandon flood relief scheme, which has received huge public funding, and €5 million has gone into the Bandon public realm project. The Clonakilty and Skibbereen flood relief schemes have been funded. Significant public money is going into west Cork and the Deputy knows that. That will continue. I travel in west Cork a lot, in particular during the summer when there are a lot of championship matches there because the county board always sends us there for a variety of reasons. I can get from A to B relatively quickly. I was in Clonakilty during the summer when major investment in a treasury company in Clonakilty Park was announced. There has been a dramatic increase in employment and significant investment, which is a huge vote of confidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">Are we likely to see the vitally important reform of planning legislation come for the House before the end of term? We are all conscious that there are only two more sitting weeks. This is a vitally important Bill that has been promised by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. The Minister previously committed to bringing the Bill before the House before Christmas. I and others have heard from many constituents about concerns and delays in the planning system caused by the ongoing chaos with aspects of the governance of An Bord Pleanála. We need this vitally important legislation to come before us soon, given the scale of the housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">We have reached a tipping point in the housing crisis. It is as hard as I have ever seen for somebody to get a house or find a place to rent. There are 11,000 people homeless. A young woman and two children came to my constituency office yesterday and pleaded with me to contact the Housing Agency, which I did. Within the space of two hours, 114 people had sought accommodation. Things have become really serious. It is time that all parties got together and had one working group. Four weeks out from Christmas, people want their own homes. I ask everybody in the House to work together. I know the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is trying to do his best. Instead of shooting from four or five different points, we need a working group to work together before Christmas.</p>

No consideration has been given to the families of staff or Members in coming up with that date to facilitate the switchover in respect of the position of Taoiseach.

To expect that staff can just drop their families on the Saturday before Christmas and come in to facilitate that sitting goes against everything we talk about when we discuss having a family friendly Parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I am seeking an urgent debate on what happened at this morning's Cabinet meeting regarding the bonuses to be paid to the fat cats in the banks. In case the Taoiseach tries to put words in my mouth, I am not talking about ordinary officials. Many nurses and healthcare workers are still waiting for the €1,000 the Government promised them. At the stroke of a pen, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe can bring in this measure bankers and those in government will all say it is great. This is at a time when people cannot live and cannot put food on the table or fuel in their oil tanks. They are being obliged to choose between doing one or the other. On what kind of planet are those in government living? I know they go over and back to their friends in Europe and they have nice meals and talk and everything else, but I ask them to think of the ordinary people who bailed out the banks. The grandchildren of those individuals will be paying back that debt in the future. The Government is giving the two fingers to people with this decision to pay those on €500,000 per year bonuses of up to €20,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">For months we have been asking the Government to increase the social housing income thresholds. There was an announcement a couple of weeks ago, but we have had no detail about that whatsoever. There needs to be a debate to establish what the new thresholds are and, critically, whether the thousands of people who were taken off the housing list in recent years because of the failure of the Government to increase the thresholds will be restored to the list. We also need to know what will happen to people who are above the new thresholds and what housing supports they will get if they find themselves threatened with eviction or homelessness or if they are unable to afford market prices on houses. Those matters need to be discussed before the end of this term. Will we get a commitment from the Government to that effect?</p>

          <p eId="para_189">Deputy Bacik expressed her concern regarding the consolidated planning and development Bill, which the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will bring to Government on 13 December. I have repeatedly stated that we will publish the Bill before the end of the year but that it will go into the pre-legislative scrutiny process because it is a major legislative measure and will require such scrutiny. The Minister will be bringing forward the planning and development and foreshore (amendment) Bill in respect of An Bord Pleanála. The heads of the Bill were approved by Cabinet earlier today. The Minister will bring the Bill before the Seanad next week. That Bill will provide for amendments in respect of An Bord Pleanála and will also contain emergency measures to accelerate the provision of rapid social housing on public lands. That will be debated in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> On Deputy Fitzpatrick's comments, all parties need to get together in the context of housing projects that come before local authorities. I refer, in particular, to projects envisaged for lands that local authorities own. There needs to be quick agreement in respect of how those lands should be used for housing. The Government published Housing for All. We appeal to everybody to get behind Housing for All and to not to be opposing projects too easily. Too many projects are being opposed for local political reasons at a time when we have a major crisis in the context of trying to get more houses built as rapidly as we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Deputy Whitmore referred to the House sitting on 17 December. This is similar to what happened when the Government was first formed.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">It has merits and challenges. The Oireachtas committee is engaging with the childcare providers in respect of what can be done on the day. It will allow for flexibility in the following week, which is probably arguably more child-friendly in some respects. In other words, Deputies will have more flexibility in the crucial days leading up to Christmas. That is a consideration also.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Deputy Mattie McGrath raised the need for an urgent debate on the bank bonuses. Again, it is not bonuses for people earning more than €500,000. The removal of the cap is about basic remuneration, and to allow bonuses and variable pay for ordinary workers at all levels of the banks, and standard benefits as well. I do not know why the Deputy would be against workers in banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">As the Taoiseach is aware, the 35 families living in Tathony House have all received notices to quit. The landlord is selling the property. Among the tenants are healthcare workers, construction workers and community workers. These families, many with children, are facing a future of homelessness. It is that stark. Dublin City Council has met with the residents. It is currently exploring whether it or an approved housing body can purchase the development and keep the families <i>in situ</i>, as social and cost-rental tenants. Will the Taoiseach commit to doing everything in his power to ensure that these 35 families do not become homeless?</p>

          <p eId="para_231">Last week, I asked the Taoiseach about childcare and if the Government will move more swiftly towards a public childcare model; affordable for parents, fair for professionals and guaranteeing equality for children. I am looking at the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, because I did also acknowledge the steps the Minister has taken towards building that model and the provision of core funding. I want to ask about one specific aspect. Last week, the Taoiseach said that the budget will support a reduction of 25% in childcare fees for parents. In reality, however, and certainly in Dublin, it looks as if the fee reduction parents are likely to see next year will not come close to 25%. Fees in Dublin are significantly higher than the national average. Parents in my constituency are paying as much as €1,000 per month per child. Many parents are unable to access childcare places. Another crèche in my constituency will be closing this week. Will the Taoiseach say what the Government will do to secure affordable childcare for parents?</p>

          <p eId="para_232">It is an average cut of 25%. It is €121 million this year. We want to increase it again next year and do better. Overall, it is €259 million this year in core funding. Again, if the Deputy has specific issues, I invite her to take them up with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well. We are getting some concerns articulated by some areas in the wider childcare sector but, by and large, the funding has gone up exponentially in the past two years. Last year, it was used to improve pay and conditions and the employment regulation order was introduced and agreed by unions and employers, which was good, while this year, we are working on affordability to a significant degree. The Minister is whispering to me about his bid for next year in terms of the Estimates but the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are not here to comment. The Deputy might revert with details on the specific cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Primary schools all over the country are finding it difficult to get teachers, with the issue near crisis point in Wicklow, Kildare and Dublin. In fact, principals are finding it nearly impossible to provide the most basic educational service and that is just keeping classrooms open. This is causing significant problems for all pupils but particularly those with special needs. Earlier throughout Covid, those children were left behind because classrooms and education were not available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> What measures is the Taoiseach's Government taking to make sure our classrooms have enough teachers available to them and will he reintroduce the banked hours system that ran during Covid so that those children with additional needs and their special educational needs, SEN, teachers can bank the hours being spent on other classroom provision?</p>

          <p eId="para_240"> On the broader question, there is an issue with supply in certain areas, but the Minister for Education has taken a raft of initiatives, as the Deputy is probably aware, to try in the short term to provide additional resources to schools to enable them to access teachers on a temporary basis and also to increase longer term supply. I will ask the Minister to outline in detail to the Deputy the range of measures she has introduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I do not know whether the Taoiseach saw the "Prime Time" story on Thursday which was a powerful exposé of the context of apartment and duplex defects, the horrendous situation facing the victims and the responsibility for the system of self-certification introduced by Fianna Fáil. It focused, in particular, on those living in The Crescent, Park West, who are facing an incredible bill of €68,500 to fix defects that are not their fault and that they could not possibly have known about, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Up to 100,000 people are in similar situations, but most of them do not know it yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Will the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage meet the residents of The Crescent, Park West, and other developments who are working together in the Not Our Fault campaign? After the way it has treated these people, why is Harcourt Developments, the developer in Park West, in receipt of massive sums of public money through, for example, the regeneration scheme of Waterford’s north quays?</p>

I intend to bring recommendations to Cabinet in advance of Christmas. I have been engaging directly with the Apartment Owners’ Network and the Construction Defects Alliance, which form part of the working group, on a regular basis and I continue to do so. We are going to set up a mechanism in advance of Christmas to update other interested residents. I know the Deputy has mentioned this to me previously. We have had about 100 different requests from different groups right across the country that, to be fair, are engaged in the process and we will find a mechanism to be able to meet them, potentially virtually, and to do that in advance of Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">Can the Taoiseach explain why the grant process for inserting an electric vehicle charger within the home must be assessed and approved prior to postage and insertion? An older cohort of my constituents have complained to me about this process. They actioned Government policy to move to electric vehicles. They inserted the charger and then applied for the grant for the charger. Their application for the grant was subsequently rejected due to the fact they had already inserted the charger. This is backwards. I have an electric car. When one applies for the grant, one must have the registration of the car. It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

However, we one sees busloads of young men arriving in an area in the dead of night and being put into industrial buildings, which we see happening in different parts of the country, we need a proper debate and a proper understanding. We must listen to communities and not have the head of an NGO for dealing with refugees lecturing the community as to what they should do and how they should behave. This has gotten out of hand.

          <p eId="para_267">The mica action committee held a protest in Lifford yesterday regarding the inaction of Donegal County Council in rolling out a scheme that many homeowners could buy into. It seems that the council is simply waiting for the Department to make a decision in terms of putting the scheme together. Something needs to happen very quickly to provide accommodation for families who have had to leave their homes because they are being destroyed by mica. They cannot wait for a remediation scheme. The council should be putting together sites and preparing temporary accommodation for those families who urgently need it. They cannot wait for a scheme to be addressed.</p>

I met with the chief executive and two directors of services from Donegal County Council very recently. We went through the specific issue regarding those homes that are deemed to be uninhabitable right now and discussed how we can advance the arrangements with regard to expenses and other accommodation. Those are the same enhanced measures we brought forward in the new defective concrete blocks scheme that is underpinned by the legislation we passed. I am waiting for the local authority to revert to me on some items, particularly around the scale of that particular cohort of homeowners we want to help, and we will help. We are working through that right now. I will keep Deputies from the region fully informed of progress on that. I am acutely aware of how urgent it is, however. The basis we are doing this is under the new enhanced scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">Just under two years ago a company called Rehab Logistics in Raheen in Limerick, which provided sheltered employment for vulnerable people, went out of business and made its 38 staff members redundant. At the time, a redundancy package was agreed between the workers and Rehab Ireland and both parties signed off on that. That agreement was subsequently endorsed by the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. Now, unfortunately, Rehab Ireland has decided to renege on that agreement and is proposing to offer much less. Many of those people have worked for this company for a very long period of time, and most of them are suffering from profound disability and will need care into the future. In view of the fact that Rehab Ireland is a publicly funded body, can the Government use its powers of persuasion or influence to ask Rehab Ireland to honour its commitment to these vulnerable workers? It is an appalling way to treat them. The amount of money involved is only a couple of hundred thousand euro.</p>

The coalition has identified that there is an opportunity for this directive to be a win-win for citizens, women's rights, companies, states and the planet. The general approach is to be agreed at this Thursday's Competitiveness Council meeting on 1 December. There are concerns and reports abroad that the Council is taking an approach which is detrimental to human rights and the environment. There are also reports that Ireland is advocating for the exclusion of, for example, of asset managers and investors from the CSDD. Where do we stand on this? How will the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, be using Ireland's voice on our behalf in these negotiations? Will we be looking for industry carve-outs or will we be looking for the strongest and most constructive position possible?</p>

They are not toys; they are a dangerous vehicle. Some are capable of high speeds, are being driven with no lights, helmets or high-vis jackets. You can see them coming and going at night out of this place, and no protective clothing whatsoever is being worn. There are increased numbers of complaints from pedestrians, cyclists and other road users about them. As I said, many people are being seriously injured, including the users of the scooters. The Bill has completed its Fifth Stage in the Seanad, as I understand. Secondary legislation will deal with many of the issues such as age, helmets, insurance, max speeds, lights and footpaths. I just ask that the Minister for Transport will include those-----</p>

          <p eId="para_306">Deputy Ó Murchú raised the issues of disinformation and hate. He identified shocking examples and the Minister has published hate legislation designed to go after people who do horrendous acts like that. There is no toleration of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> On Deputy Mairéad Farrell's issue, I was not quite sure of the legislative response. She referred to fraud on a Revolut account and asked who someone could contact. There is an issue and the banking review published today deals with new technology banking companies, as well as the non-bank sector. I will come back to the Deputy from the Central Bank perspective with clarity around the regulatory context for Revolut and the measures it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has been with the residents in relation to that tornado in Wexford. It was decided at Cabinet last week that it would come under a scheme along with other storm-ravaged areas. Because of the difference in the type of event, it being a tornado, there is the question of how to apply the scheme and so on but there will be a scheme. That has been announced.</p>

The temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, to help businesses with energy costs will be introduced before the end of the year. We need to see how that lands and what the experience is on the ground with a view to keeping it under review. We will be keeping an eye on the impact of the energy crisis on small and medium-sized companies and, in particular, the help they get from the scheme which will be introduced before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_358">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_359"> I participated in the world leaders summit at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh on 7 and 8 November. On 8 November, I delivered Ireland's national statement to the plenary session, taking the opportunity to set out Ireland's climate ambition and the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable countries which, despite having contributed least to climate change, are bearing the brunt of its impact. While the situation is very serious, I was clear that it is not too late to act and that it is realistic for our legacy to be a sustainable planet.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> I engaged in a number of high-level events and round-table discussions, including on food security and on the sustainability of vulnerable communities. I joined the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, and the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at a high-level event on “The Global Shield Against Climate Risks”, where I announced that Ireland will contribute €10 million to the initiative for 2023.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> I also availed of my visit to COP to hold a bilateral meeting with the President of Vanuatu and had the opportunity to engage with a number of fellow world leaders over the course of the two days. I heard first-hand from the Prime Minister of Pakistan and others of the devastation caused to their countries by the devastating impacts of climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_362"> While at COP27, I also met with the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Agnes Callamard, a number of Irish youth climate advocates, representatives of humanitarian NGOs, and international delegates supported by Irish Aid. I also met with a number of academics and students from UCC and UCD, second level students, and with a representative of the EPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> In my engagements, I highlighted Ireland's ambition to see progress on the issue of loss and damage and on the implementation of commitments to take action to mitigate climate change, and to deliver upon climate finance promises. Ireland has committed to more than double our climate finance provision to at least €225 million a year by 2025.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> I welcome the historic agreement reached at COP27 to establish a special loss and damage fund to pay for climate-related damage suffered by vulnerable nations. This will mean that millions of people whose land, water sources and livelihoods are being eroded every day because of the impacts of climate change, can begin to look forward to targeted and strengthened support and protection from the global community. While the overall agreement does not go far enough on the issue of mitigation, the commitment of the conference to keep “1.5 alive” is important and welcome. The European Union will continue to work to keep the ambition of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p>

            <p eId="para_365">The climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis are intrinsically linked. The Taoiseach is well aware that we have a biodiversity crisis. Some 60% of our birds are on an endangered list. The condition of many of our marine and land habitats is worsening. Our record of upholding EU biodiversity and climate law has not been good and certainly needs to improve. The Citizens’ Assembly voted overwhelmingly, with 87% in favour, to insert protecting biodiversity into our Constitution. I want to get the Taoiseach’s thoughts about a referendum on giving biodiversity and habitats that constitutional protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_366">The Egyptian authorities arrested 1,540 Egyptian people in the weeks just before COP to prevent them organising protests. Thousands of people have been imprisoned and detained. Even when they get judicial orders for their release, they disappear. Alaa Abd El-Fattah has been imprisoned for five years for “spreading fake news”, by which it is meant that he utters words critical of the El-Sisi regime. Did the Taoiseach even raise these issues with the Egyptian authorities, never mind question whether it was appropriate to go to a conference held in a country whose regime is so brutal that it crushes even the mildest voices of criticism of the El-Sisi regime?</p>

            <p eId="para_367">The Taoiseach said we are keeping 1.5 alive, but there is no evidence of that. The world is on a trajectory of perhaps 3.5°C warming, if not worse. There is no greater illustration of the failure of COP27 and the failure of this capitalist system to address the climate crisis than the absence of a commitment even to phase out fossil fuels. The failure to recognise that and include it in the text speaks to the power of the fossil fuel lobbyists, 636 of whom were present at COP27, and the commitment of governments to protect the interests of big oil and gas. We have the same text as came from COP26 - efforts towards the phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. Now we have reference to an increase in low emission and renewable energy, which could mean anything, such as nuclear power, coal with carbon capture and storage, or fossil gas. Here, the Government plans to keep Moneypoint open, fuelled by oil and ramped up because of all the electricity required for the data centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_368">Today, a young man from UCD Ronan Browne is taking the drastic action of a hunger and thirst strike to force some action on climate change. I support that young man. The behaviour of the Irish State has not inspired the young generation who are extremely worried about the future. There is a glaring contradiction between what the Taoiseach says and what he does. I previously asked him about the stance Ireland took on the directive on corporate sustainability and due diligence. The Taoiseach reported that he campaigned for it, but that he needed to strike a balance. I asked him if those directives would require finance companies to be as responsible as the rest of us are meant to be over the climate. This morning I got a letter back from the Taoiseach in which he said that he wanted to strike an objective balance but did not say what that balance is.</p>
            <p eId="para_369">Does that mean that finance companies have the right to make profits over and above the enforcement of corporate sustainability in the climate? Could the Taoiseach please clarify? </p>

            <p eId="para_370">The issue of a commitment to a rapid transition from fossil fuels was sorely lacking in the COP27 text. What is the position of the Taoiseach and the Government on Ireland's continued membership of the Energy Charter Treaty, ECT? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has clearly flagged that the ECT is a barrier to climate action and that it is being used by the fossil fuel industry to delay decarbonisation and to leave the public with the bill for their stranded assets. The ECT secretariat is actively seeking oil and gas-rich countries in the global south to join. Therefore, the continued membership of Ireland is legitimising this predatory behaviour. A number of EU countries, including most recently Germany, have indicated their intention to leave. Will Ireland do the same?</p>

            <p eId="para_371">Many have spoken about the difficulties surrounding COP27 and about what the people have not signed up for. We want to make whatever moves we can away from fossil fuels. District heating can be one of those solutions. I once again bring up the issue of communal heating systems that are now being powered by gas. A feasibility study has already started around geothermal in respect of Carlinn Hall, Dundalk. None of this will work in this shift, however, unless we have a grant scheme in place to facilitate this communities, for example in the areas of geothermal or woodchip. Beyond that, we will need mitigations. I thought the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, could have been a means by which we facilitated those residents who are under severe pressure. That is an opportunity that has been missed. We need a bespoke solution to get people through this winter. Thereafter, we can help them to switch to a better system and we can get that all-round improvement.</p>

            <p eId="para_372">Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan raised the issue of the Citizens’ Assembly on Biodiversity Loss. It is my understanding that it made a recommendation for a referendum. I have not yet received a full report but I look forward to receiving the report from the citizens’ assembly. We will give consideration and examination to all the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_373"> In the first instance, my main focus is on actions now to dramatically improve our performance in biodiversity. Already, the Government has radically changed the landscape, excuse the pun, for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, enabling an agency within the Government to be established, with its own internal board to direct the affairs of the agency. We are also doubling the funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and increasing its resources even more to enable it to work across Departments and across the country in respect of the restoration of biodiversity and preservation of biodiversity. Also, we will require more resources to be allocated to the National Parks and Wildlife Service to deal with the huge issue of the forthcoming European Union directive in respect of the restoration of biodiversity, both urban and rural, between now and 2050 with interval years. This will be extremely challenging and it has not really received much attention in the House or across the board. We have put together Departments now to develop a negotiating position on that. In other words, I think we need to keep the balance between a focus on immediate actions and on resourcing the practical operational needs right now, because we are coming from behind. We are coming from a service that was across different Departments for too long. For approximately over a decade it was residing in different Departments. We want to give a permanency and security to the National Parks and Wildlife Service and increased budgets that will make a difference in relation to biodiversity. Again, we will have to look at the full implementations of any recommendations for a referendum. What exactly will it mean? What will the proposed wording look like? We will have to examine all of that. </p>
            <p eId="para_374"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of human rights in Egypt. Concerns about human rights is a real issue and we have raised it on a continuous basis with Egypt, both bilaterally and in multilateral forums. We have raised issues including freedom of expression, space for civil society, digital freedom and treatment of human rights defenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_375"> At the UN Human Rights Council in March 2021, Ireland co-signed a statement expressing concern about human rights in Egypt, including its use of terrorism legislation to detain human rights defenders and civil society activists. The protection of human rights defenders forms a key part of Ireland’s foreign policy. I understand Alaa Abd el-Fattah has paused his hunger strike and that his family was allowed to visit him on 17 November. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has raised this issue and other human rights issues in his discussion with the foreign minister, Mr. Shoukry, when they met recently at COP27. No one should be detained for exercising their basic human rights or for defending the rights of others. We consistently raise that. </p>
            <p eId="para_376"> On the issue of going to COP27, on one level it was important that it was held in east Africa, because Africa is a continent that at times feels excluded from the debate. It is particularly important in terms of the loss and damage fund and climate finance. That is an issue that is important to Africa in particular. All of the COPs cannot be held in Europe or in the US all of the time. They must be hosted in locations that may not suit everybody at any given time. That is the reality. That is a challenge but it is important that world leaders meet on this issue on an annual basis. That is my view, because if they do not then momentum could slip. Ireland is not responsible for the entire world and we have to look after our own affairs first. We have a democracy here but we cannot change the entire world on our own. It is by being members of multilateral fora that we can help to shape the world to a better place. Ireland does that well through its aid programmes and through its foreign policy more generally. </p>
            <p eId="para_377"> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue that the capitalist system, as he described it, has failed. He does not see any evidence of keeping the 1.5 alive. There are many countries with whom we do not see eye to eye on their policies. The big oil producers such as Russia, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and the OPEC countries obviously want to retain as much oil and gas as they can. That is why we must develop alternatives as quickly as we can, such as more wind energy, more offshore wind energy, solar power and other alternative sources of energy. That is the big challenge that is facing us. The European Union has probably made the most advances in relation to these areas and others. Those big challenges will come but it is not the role of Europe, or indeed of Ireland, as the Deputy suggests, to look after big oil and gas. That is not the case. </p>

That is clear in our strategies. In response to Deputy Ó Murchú, that is our position. I put it to both Deputies that their position on how to deal with the price increases would have been to give a blank cheque to the fossil fuel companies. It would probably have been very damaging to the economy if we had implemented their proposal of the energy cap, which the energy companies would have benefited from. We need a bespoke approach on district heating. I will come back to the Deputy on that and I have said it to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p>

            <p eId="para_405">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 15, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on accommodation and supports for Ukrainian refugees, which I chair, oversees the whole-of-government humanitarian response to supporting people from Ukraine who have sought temporary protection here. Membership of the Cabinet committee includes the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and for Transport; the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage; the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; the Minister for Social Protection; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Other Ministers and Ministers of State attend the Cabinet committee as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> The numbers of people seeking temporary protection in Ireland as a consequence of the horrific war in Ukraine is unprecedented in the history of the State. Ireland has never seen so many people arrive in such a short timeframe and tens of thousands are receiving assistance. Since the start of this terrible war, over 65,000 people arriving from Ukraine have availed of temporary protection in Ireland. This equates to more than 1.2% of our population and compares very favourably with other European countries, demonstrating our solidarity with Ukraine and the rest of Europe in dealing with the crisis. </p>
            <p eId="para_407"> This level of response is challenging and absolutely unprecedented in the history of our State. Nevertheless, the Government is clear that, in the face of further arrivals, an approach that will bring greater consistency to the State's response and ensure equity for all those who rely on State supports is needed now as we continue to meet our obligations to those seeking protection here in Ireland. With this in mind, the Government agreed in October to the following measures: a doubling of the tax-free recognition payment from €400 to €800; a €50 million community fund to recognise local efforts; an expansion of rapid-build and accommodation refurbishment programmes; allowing for dormitory-style accommodation to maximise places; a new State-led call for vacant homes and a focus on future trends and planning for sustainable supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_408"> I will now outline the measures currently being progressed by the Government in order to provide additional accommodation. The property refurbishment programme is being expanded and accelerated and the process of compiling a searchable database of accommodation is beginning. The rapid-build housing programme has commenced with the first order of units already under way with the installation of 500 rapid-build homes by February and March 2023, providing accommodation for 2,000 people at a number of sites across the country. The new local authority-led Offer a Home campaign was successfully launched last week. This involves a doubling of the recognition payment to €800, irrespective of the nature of the offer of properties and accommodation. </p>
            <p eId="para_409"> The Government has also allocated €5 million to the Community Foundation for Ireland for the Ireland for Ukraine campaign. This is providing 50% of its funds to aid charities providing support on the ground and 50% to provide grant aid for Irish charities and community and voluntary organisations assisting people who have fled from the war to this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> I acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by local communities in welcoming people from Ukraine. In recognition of such local, community-led solidarity, the Government has committed to a €50 million programme of supports, as I have said. Detailed proposals are currently being developed to provide additional resources at local level to ensure that access to public services and community centre facilities for local communities are maintained and expanded. Ireland's humanitarian response will continue. Policy work by various Departments is also continuing on an ongoing assessment of the sustainability of the initial emergency response. This work is also looking to the medium and longer-term issues. The Cabinet committee will meet again on 12 December.</p>

            <p eId="para_411">It was reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday that Dr. Catherine Day believes the Government's commitment to end direct provision by 2024 will not be met due to the pressures on emergency accommodation arising out of the war in Ukraine. It was also her view that the targets set out in the Housing for All plan need to be significantly increased to take into account the increase in population. The expert group headed up by Dr. Day has submitted a report to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, recommending that the State build two reception centres on State-owned land by May and another four by the end of next year. Will that happen? Does the Taoiseach still believe that the Government will end direct provision by 2024 as currently committed to? Will the Housing for All targets be increased as Dr. Day has recommended?</p>

We all accept that we must put serious effort into streamlining the means by which accommodation is made available. We need to ensure that communication is improved if we are to avoid repeats of some of the incidents that have taken place, including in Carlingford. People from outside have jumped on this issue, which is utterly reprehensible. These are things we need to fix. We have long had a serious issue with regard to direct provision and our processing. A great deal of streamlining needs to be done. This is what we have to do if we are to deliver for people.</p>

            <p eId="para_413">The Taoiseach knows that we are completely opposed to Ireland's participation in the so-called military assistance mission of the EU to train the Ukrainian army. Training one side in a military conflict is a breach of military neutrality. This is part of a drive to integrate Ireland into a process of European militarisation and align Ireland with NATO. It is a full-spectrum military training mission whose purpose, according to the European Council, is "to contribute to enhancing the military capability of Ukraine’s Armed Forces". The Taoiseach has been at pains to emphasise that the Irish Defence Forces will be involved in de-mining training. However, during questions to the Minister for Defence last week, I asked for a guarantee that the Defence Forces would only be involved in de-mining and nothing else. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, repeatedly failed to give me that guarantee, saying that the details had not been finalised. Will the Taoiseach give me a guarantee that this is all he is sending Defence Forces troops to do?</p>

This follows on from our participation in the Ukraine defence contact group which, according to the US Secretary of Defence, is part of NATO and whose first meeting was held on a NATO base in Germany. It is absolutely clear that the Irish Government is disregarding this country's neutrality and the commitment of this majority of people in this country to that neutrality in order to align us with NATO to the extent that we now have NATO commanders assessing our troops in County Cork.</p>

            <p eId="para_417">As of yesterday, there were 3,459 Ukrainian refugees in County Clare. This represents approximately 3% of our county's entire population. In the early days, when refugees arrived in places like Doolin and Lisdoonvarna, they were given personal public service, PPS, numbers and staff from Intreo services and the Department of Social Protection came out to assess their skill sets, language skills and so on. This resulted in some getting into employment but there are many more who are hungry to work in Ireland. I met some of them yesterday. To give an example, we have several Ukrainian dentists in County Clare. Their qualifications do not align with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, requirements so they cannot practice. It is the same with some nurses and doctors. We have a labour shortage in Clare, although it is hard to believe. I know of one butcher who had to apply for a work permit for a South African guy to come to work in his shop. There is more that can be done to activate these workers. I ask that, through this committee, the Taoiseach engage with Intreo and those providing accelerated training in reading and literacy skills to these Ukrainians to activate that labour force. They are hungry to work and contribute.</p>

            <p eId="para_421">I believe I am next. As of today, 65,660 refugees have been granted temporary protection. We also have 12,347 applicants for international protection. We had 24 refugees at the airport facility last night. There is no sign of any levelling off. My concern relates to the accommodation situation, which is very challenging. This week, we have seen county councils appealing for unused houses to meet this need. Has a plan been put in place with local authorities to provide for staffing to get this work done?</p>
            <p eId="para_422">Another issue, which I bring up constantly, is the quick build or the modular build, which would be across all local authorities and for everyone across the board. What are we doing on this? Housing and accommodation need is critical now.</p>

            <p eId="para_423">Almost every week the Taoiseach tells the Dáil that the State is not politically neutral but is militarily neutral. I wish to quote from an article in the <i>journal.ie</i> earlier this month:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_424">For decades Irish soldiers have trained on the high uplands of Kilworth ranges, located just off the old Cork to Dublin road between the towns of Fermoy and Mitchelstown. ... The laughs and banter of the Irish accents were mixed with foreign voices on the day <i>The Journal </i>visited. There are a host of European uniforms from Germany, Czech Republic, Austria and other locations and even a US uniform mixing with the various men and women. ... [There are] yellow vest wearing soldiers taking notes with a distinctive patch on their arms. These are, uniquely in an Irish setting, NATO assessors. ... One of those assessors is US Navy Commander Sam Mason [on loan from the US military] as part of the European command of NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_425">Ireland is not politically neutral but is militarily neutral. I do not think they were talking politics up there in Kilworth. The Taoiseach might care to explain to the Dáil exactly what is going on here.</p>

            <p eId="para_426">First, Deputy O'Rourke referred to direct provision and the targets. It is going to be extremely challenging now. It is 2022 and many people in direct provision are in a position where they are now legally resident in the State and can leave direct provision if they wish, but they are staying in it at the moment. Obviously, the wider housing issue is probably a factor in that but it is a significant point nonetheless. I stand to be corrected but I believe there are some 1,800 people who could potentially leave. They are free to leave but choose to stay. That has been the position for quite some time, even before this crisis erupted.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> Examination will be given to Catherine Day's report. There are two broad issues here. A decision was taken by the Government - at the very beginning of this Government - to reorganise migration policy and action from justice to gender and equality, and that happened. That clearly has implications in that nobody anticipated the level of crisis that has subsequently occurred with the war in Ukraine and the very significant increase in those seeking international protection. This has gone way up in contrast with the previous reports we have received. We were talking about an average of 3,500 in the last report but that has all changed because of conflict in the world and a whole range of issues, from Syria, Ethiopia, climate change and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been working flat out with the Housing for All programme, even to get to the targets we have set ourselves. This is a whole-of-government approach and has been a whole-of-government approach from the beginning in dealing with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_429"> Deputy Ó Murchú raised the issue of communications, and it is a fair point. We will continue working on that to try to enhance and improve that.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the European Union military assistance programme in Europe. I take exception to the assertions by Deputies Murphy, Boyd Barrett and Barry that somehow, the war is being used by the Government as an excuse to join NATO and to work with NATO. That is a fairly sick allegation to make.</p>

            <p eId="para_504">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 25, inclusive, together. The priorities set out in my Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023 reflects the role of the Department to support me as Taoiseach and the Government to ensure a sustainable economy and a successful society, to pursue Ireland’s interests abroad, to implement the Government’s programme and to build a better future for Ireland and all her citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> My Department continues to work at the centre to ensure that policies developed support the Government's commitment to develop Ireland in a sustainable way, which supports economic development and social progress. It achieves this mainly through the Cabinet committee structure. Through the work of the 11 Cabinet committees, supported by my Department, a range of cross-Government work has been advanced under the direction of this strategy statement, including: delivering a fair and progressive budget providing €11 billion in measures to help families and businesses cope with the impact of rising prices; co-ordinating the work across Government on Ireland’s humanitarian response for over 65,000 people who have arrived from Ukraine and have availed of temporary protection in Ireland; protecting Ireland’s economic recovery through continued job creation and transitioning towards a decarbonised and digital economy; driving delivery of the Government’s Housing for All plan to increase the supply of housing and to provide a sustainable housing system into the future; supporting Ireland's role in Europe and the world, including through my participation in the European Council, Ireland's seat on the UN Security Council and with respect to continuing European Union-United Kingdom discussions on the Northern Ireland protocol; continuing to advance peace, prosperity and reconciliation on the island of Ireland including driving the delivery of our commitments on a shared island on a whole-of-government basis, through the shared island unit in my Department and the shared island fund; supporting the development of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and the Climate Action Plan 2021, which are key elements of a suite of measures introduced to fundamentally alter Ireland's approach to climate change; ongoing work of the citizens' assembly, including the two citizens’ assemblies on biodiversity loss and a directly elected mayor for Dublin, which are nearing completion; continued work across my Department on a range of initiatives such as implementing Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework; progressing Ireland’s well-being framework, developing the Government’s approach to social dialogue, implementation of the future of policing plan and work on Civil Service renewal.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">Last Friday marked International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the beginning of this year's 16 days of activism. The campaign continues the theme of ending femicide. As the programme for Government acknowledges, there is an epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. One of the programme's tools to tackle that epidemic is a commitment to legislate for the introduction of domestic homicide reviews. When will that happen? The Taoiseach will understand from his engagements on the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and with family members of victims that reassurance is now needed that the Government will deliver on its commitment to legislate for a system of independent domestic homicide reviews.</p>

            <p eId="para_508">Are we any closer to a date for a citizens' assembly on drugs? We know the issue we all have, particularly in deprived communities that are absolutely ravaged by drug gangs and drug debt intimidation. Not only should we have a citizens' assembly; I would like to think that there are also conversations going on at European level about this matter. We all accept that Ireland, whether on a 26-county or 32-county basis, is very small. Some of the solutions we will consider are the Portuguese model and necessary interventions at community and family level. We might need some sort of agreement on doing this at a wider level than just an Irish level.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">The strategy refers to the need for citizen-focused communication. In that context I raise the case of Frank Mulcahy. As the Taoiseach will know, he was the CEO of Irish Small and Medium Employers and a victim of an incredible campaign to blacken his name by people wrongly suggesting that he was involved in fraud. The Taoiseach was the Minister in the relevant Department at the time. He stated in reply to a question from Ciarán Cuffe in November 2004: "I am satisfied that no evidence or documents relevant to the allegations made by the organisation were withheld." The Taoiseach, then Minister, subsequently closed the file. That statement was incorrect. I raise the matter now to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to correct the record. I will list just some of the very many documents which were withheld: the Department's note to file, dated 26 April 1999; the memo to the Minister, dated 5 March 1999; the interdepartmental memo, dated March 2002; the Department's small business operational programme closure report 2002; and the Arthur Anderson report of March 1998. I could go on and on. Multiple documents, evidence, were withheld. I ask the Taoiseach to correct the record.</p>

            <p eId="para_510">One terrible aspect of the absolutely dire housing crisis over which the Government is presiding is that people with very serious medical conditions are looking to gain medical priority but waiting months for their cases to be looked at, even though they are in dire situations, clearly because of lack of resources for medical assessment in local authorities. Something needs to be done about it urgently. I will give the Taoiseach a few examples: a 73-year-old with a very severe spinal condition who is couch-surfing with family members and being asked for more and more reports; a man of 66 receiving cancer treatment who was sleeping in his van, has made several attempts on his life and has still not been properly assessed; a woman who was for nine hours on a dialysis machine and who submitted medical forms in November of last year; and a 68-year-old man who is epileptic and facing the possibility of eviction, having submitted his stuff in September. The list goes on. Something urgently needs to be done about vulnerable, unwell, mostly elderly people not having their housing needs assessed quickly and efficiently.</p>

            <from>Deputy Cathal Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_511">There are 17,000 aircraft on order by Irish aircraft leasing companies. We have a position of world dominance in this regard. More than half of all aircraft in the world are Irish-registered, and there are assets of €130 billion or thereabouts registered to Irish-based leasing companies. This is a colossal sector. Bearing in mind that 17,000 planes are on order, and just like Ireland pursued the biopharma, smart tech and social media sectors and there was a strategy to get them to come to headquarter here in Ireland, we should also now, as we look to the new year ahead of us, start looking at strategically trying to entice aircraft manufacturing. There is precedent here. The Turkish Government some time ago had a massive order of Turkish Airlines aircraft coming in. It insisted on Airbus basing some of its manufacturing sites in Turkey based solely on the quantity of orders coming into the country. I would love to see a strategy on not just maintenance and repair of aircraft but also the manufacturing of some components of aircraft.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_512">The strategy statement of the Department of the Taoiseach refers to the need to offer objective and evidence-informed advice to the Government. It refers to a deep-rooted public service ethos of independence, integrity and impartiality. In that context I ask the Taoiseach about the Romanes lecture he gave to the University of Oxford earlier this month under the heading The Centre Will Hold: Liberal Democracy and the Populist Threat. It is clear the Taoiseach is concerned about populist offerings and simplistic solutions to complex problems and the portrayal of experts as part of some sort of elite conspiracy. We are all aware of a recent call for the sacking of the chief economist at the Department of Finance. Of course, our Civil Service should be open to reform, but how important is it, does the Taoiseach think, in today's world, with all the threats to democracy, for a democratic system to have an impartial Civil Service giving objective information on the policy issues of the day?</p>

            <p eId="para_513">Parents of babies whose organs were sent abroad for incineration without their knowledge or consent received the long-awaited report into the scandal from Cork University Hospital on Friday. These parents should not have been forced to wait until the report's release to find out that their babies' organs had been incinerated in Denmark and not, as they previously had been told, in Belgium. Does the Taoiseach agree that the holding back of this information was very wrong? It appears that Cork University Maternity Hospital might have been in a position to deal with the organs in a far more sensitive way but that the parents were not asked or contacted. Does the Taoiseach that this was extraordinary and that it raises questions as to whether the left hand knows what the right hand is doing at Cork University Hospital management level? Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the human tissue Bill, which came before the Cabinet earlier, will make disposal of organs and tissues without consent illegal in future? It should do.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_326">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_514">Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of femicide and the broader issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. A great deal of progress has been made on that matter under the Cabinet social affairs committee and the work of the Ministers for Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, respectively. Various reports on this issue are coming, and a broad range of issues are covered under the strategy, including the independent reviews. I will come back to the Deputy with the detail of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_515"> Deputy Ó Murchú raised the issue of the citizens' assembly on drugs. I hope we will be able to start that early in the new year because I think the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss is coming to the end of its work, although it has asked for a bit more time. I understand that the Dublin Citizens' Assembly has sent in its report. A citizens' assembly on education is next. The Deputy referred to the island of Ireland. The shared island dialogue is the way to go in that regard. We now have 2,500 people involved in the dialogue on a range of different issues. The research we are doing under the shared island unit is the most comprehensive of its kind and the most systematic ever undertaken. It is very valuable research. Productivity is the most recent issue that has emerged through the Economic and Social Research Institute. I refer to the school completion services sector north and south and the healthcare and primary care systems. That is very good research which points to pragmatic issues we have to deal with and in respect of which both our jurisdictions can learn as to where some issues are strong in one jurisdiction as opposed to the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">There is also general investment on projects such as that relating to the Narrow Water bridge, which I visited with the Deputy. That project is a good example of how the shared island initiative is working. On the Ulster Canal, the Government again approved more funding . That is the way to go in the context of mutual understanding and building reconciliation.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> Deputy Paul Murphy referred to Frank Mulcahy and raised certain matters. That is a long-running issue which predated my arrival into the relevant Department. I am not prepared to affirm or confirm what the Deputy said out of the blue. There is a long-running issue in that regard. I have dealt with these matters in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the housing crisis and those with dire medical conditions. Again, there are provisions for local authorities to deal with people with very severe medical conditions in terms of access to housing. People do benefit from allocation of houses in such situations.</p>

            <p eId="para_522">I know, but we will do whatever we can there.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> Deputy Cathal Crowe referred to jobs for Ukrainian refugees earlier. I did not have the chance to respond but I will take the matter up now. I do think we should move faster. In some cases, the qualifications authorities are working to accelerate people being enabled to work in certain professions.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> The Deputy also referred to aircraft leasing and aircraft manufacturing. It is a huge endeavour. Airbus was a partnership between the UK, France and Germany. It was a massive project that took over 30 years. We could evolve our maintenance and manufacture component parts of aircraft because we have a lot of skills in that area in Ireland and we should build on that. By the way, most of these companies in the end will become technology companies just as the car industry will shift to a technology industry. We have lots of skill sets in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> I agree 100% with Deputy Haughey on the need for objective advice from the Civil Service. I was concerned by suggestions that civil servants should be sacked because they had points of view on various issues. That suggestion was subsequently retracted and an apology issued, which I welcome. The Deputy's basic point is that democracy requires an impartial public service that gives its view. The view does not always have to be agreed, with but it is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> To respond to Deputy Barry, the HSE has accepted that what happened was wrong and should not have happened. The maternity hospital should have been consulted on these issues. Great hurt has been done to the parents concerned.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_531">We meet at a critical moment. This year alone, we have witnessed record temperatures, wildfires, calamitous floods, and prolonged droughts across the world. Populations are on the move because, before our eyes, parts of our world are becoming less amenable to human habitation. On every continent of the planet, our people are living with the reality of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I am particularly concerned about the plight of the least developed countries. These countries are not only experiencing the overlapping impacts of Covid-19 and the devastating consequences for food supply of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they are also bearing the brunt of the climate change that is unfolding.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> In Sharm el-Sheikh, I heard at first hand from the Prime Minister of Pakistan of the devastation caused by the floods in his country. More than one third of Pakistan and over 30 million of its people have been affected. Crops have been destroyed. Vital infrastructure was damaged beyond repair. People had the sum of their lifetime's efforts simply swept away. In Africa, people are living through some of the most extreme effects of the climate crisis. This year more than 20 million people in the drought-hit Horn of Africa are mired in a severe hunger crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> We in Ireland do not sit in splendid isolation on this. Last month was the warmest October Europe has experienced singe records began, with temperatures 2°C above a 1991-2020 reference period, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. According to the World Meteorological Organization, temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average in the past 30 years; the highest of any continent in the world. As the warming trend continues, it expects exceptional heat, wildfires, devastating floods and other impacts to wreak a worsening toll on our societies, economies and ecosystems. It was against this serious backdrop that I attended the recent World Leaders' Summit at COP27.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> What we are increasingly seeing around the world are not natural disasters; they are the consequences and the impact of human activity. The people who are too frequently bearing the brunt are those least equipped to deal with it. The challenge is profound and demands our attention now but as I said at COP27, it is not yet too late to ensure a liveable planet. Indeed, that can and must be our legacy to future generations. The latest report of the UN environment programme clearly outlined the scale of the task that we share and the urgency with which we must act. The report tells us that the commitments into which countries have currently entered do not provide a credible pathway to holding temperature increases to close to 1.5°C. In fact, unless we do more collectively , the most recent data indicates that the world is on track for a temperature rise of between 2.4°C and 2.6°C by the end of this century. That is why I said at COP27 that, as leaders, it is our responsibility to drive the transformation that is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> At COP27, I also set out how we in Ireland are playing our part. As the House is aware, we have set a legally binding target of reducing our emissions by 2030 to 51% below 2018 levels and to becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050. In July of this year, we fixed limits on greenhouse gas emissions for each sector of the economy from now until 2030, to ensure we remain within legally binding carbon budgets that are consistent with our targets. The work of achieving those targets will be, as we have been clear, challenging, our work has only started, but the sectoral emissions ceilings provide an essential framework to guide our efforts. No sector is or can be unaffected by the transition we all need to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The climate action plan 2023, which will be published shortly, will set out the ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy and the actions needed to deliver on our domestic climate targets. If we are to achieve our goals, the period ahead will have to be one of delivery, with all shoulders to the wheel.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> We are also working in close partnership with our EU colleagues. The launch of the European Green Deal in December 2019 brought a new impetus to climate policy and action. The European climate law sets a binding target of a climate-neutral EU by 2050 and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990. The associated Fit for 55 package aims to strengthen Europe's position as a global climate leader. Ireland supports its increased ambition and favours its quick adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Putin's weaponisation of energy in his war on Ukraine has only underscored the need to transition away from dependence on fossil fuels as swiftly as we can. This swift transition is essential if we are to make the radical transformation needed to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises, make our economies and democracies more resilient, our industries more competitive and our societies fairer.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> As already stated, the impacts of climate change are not being felt evenly around the world. Countries that contributed least to climate change are dealing with its worst effects and will need support if they are to cope, or in some cases, to survive. I therefore welcomed the focus on loss and damage at COP27 and welcome agreement on the establishment of a fund. At the summit, I made it clear that Ireland stands with the communities and people who are fighting the devastating effects of climate change in their daily lives and that we are committed to playing our part.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> In July, the Government published our international climate finance roadmap, which reaffirms Ireland's steadfast commitment to supporting people and communities in developing countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We have committed to increase our funding to €225 million per annum by 2025. The roadmap builds on the priority Ireland has long attached to supporting adaptation and climate resilience, while expanding our work with vulnerable coastal communities and small island developing states that are increasingly threatened by climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> While at the summit, I met the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. I heard directly from him about the existential nature of the challenge his country, which is made up of 83 small islands strung out over 1,300 km in the Pacific, faces. The country is living through more tropical storms of increasing ferocity and this is having devastating impacts on its economy and people. Indeed, the country is rated the most vulnerable to natural disaster by the UN. At the heart of our climate finance roadmap is a commitment to climate justice and to solidarity. We cannot simply leave the people of places like Vanuatu to fend for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> At COP27, I also attended a round-table event hosted by the German Chancellor, Mr. Olaf Scholz, and the President of Ghana, Mr. Nana Akufo-Addo. At this event, I announced that Ireland will contribute €10 million to the Global Shield initiative for 2023 to protect the most vulnerable from climate loss and damage. This initiative is sponsored by the G7 and the V20 group of vulnerable countries and is aimed at scaling up the finance needed to protect against climate risks in poor countries. Given the impact of climate change on global food security, I also highlighted Ireland's commitment of over €800 million to support nutrition over the next five years and more than €100 million in response to the devastating drought and food security crisis in countries in the Horn of Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I pay tribute to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for his tireless efforts in securing agreement on a loss and damage fund at the COP. I acknowledge the work of the official Irish delegation and its dedication and commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The outcome of the summit offers hope to the vulnerable, whose land, water sources and livelihoods are being eroded every day because of the impacts of climate change. They can begin to look forward to targeted and strengthened support and protection from the global community. Although the overall agreement reached at COP27 does not go far enough on the issue of mitigation, the commitment of the conference to "keep 1.5 alive" is important and welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> As Deputies will be aware, the leaders' summit is only a part of the wider work that is carried out at meetings of COP. The work of civic society at these meetings is vital in keeping pressure on governments around the world to step up and deliver. I very much welcomed the opportunity to meet Irish representatives at the COP, including Irish youth climate advocates, representatives of humanitarian NGOs and international delegates supported by Irish Aid, academics and students from UCC and UCD, and representatives from second level schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The message from COP27 is clear: there is no time left to waste. No nation, big or small, developed or underdeveloped, wealthy or poor, can escape the consequences of climate change, which is happening now. The situation could not be more urgent, but it is important to stress also that it is not hopeless. We have it within our power to turn things around, limit the rise in global temperatures and mitigate the worst impacts of change that is already under way. The most recent UN report shows we are bending the curve of emissions downwards even if we are not yet doing so fast enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> As I said in my address to the COP, this generation holds a special responsibility, but it remains realistic for our legacy to be a sustainable planet, a world alive with an abundance of plant and animal life, with cleaner water and healthier air, liveable cities and sustainable rural communities. We in Ireland must show the world that we are resolute in our commitment to bringing it about.</p>

        <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_549">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic. I also welcome these statements. I acknowledge the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications for his work as EU ministerial representative at the loss and damage talks in Egypt. I thank the Irish officials whose work goes unseen but which was crucial to establishing a loss and damage fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Responding to the announcement of the fund, the climate change Minister of Pakistan, Ms Sherry Rehman, highlighted that the fund is not about some countries accepting charity but that it is down payment on an investment in our futures and climate justice. Her point about climate justice is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> Wealthier countries that account for just 12% of the global population are responsible for 50% of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels and industry over the past 170 years. Wealthier countries have contributed most to global warming. Many have built their economies and current national wealth on the back of considerable emissions. It is important that this be recognised and that funding be directed towards those countries that are now feeling the devastating consequences of global warming caused by these same emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> While the loss and damage fund was really positive, other aspects of COP27 were a significant disappointment. These included attempts to roll back on commitments made only one year ago at Glasgow and the inability to agree on strong language on the phasing out of fossil fuels - all fossil fuels. Advocacy group Global Witness highlighted that over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were in attendance at the climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh. That is even more than the number who attended in Glasgow last year. Their agenda is clear: to delay the transition from fossil fuels and greenwash ineffective actions in order to protect their profit and keep a business-as-usual approach for as long as they can. Fossil fuel lobbyists have no place at the UN conference. We would not invite big tobacco lobbyists to a lung cancer conference, so we should apply the same standard here. The interests of fossil fuel lobbyists do not align with efforts to cut our emissions radically. The lobbyists got a sympathetic ear in Egypt. Their exclusion in the future would be one step towards reforming the COP ahead of the next meeting, which is to take place in one of the biggest oil-producing countries in the world. It is vital that the public have confidence in the process and that it not be seen as a talking shop or circus. On the international stage, at European level, Ireland should be advocating the reform of the COP to ensure it is sufficient and effective and that it works.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> If Ireland is to play its part in combating global warming, it needs a radical shift in the pace of delivery. We are almost midway through our first carbon budget but one would barely know that based on the action being taken. Instead of our emissions reducing by an average of 4.8% each year in the first cycle, they increased by 4.7% last year and will rise again this year. How are we supposed to meet the goal of a 51% cut by 2030 if we are this far off track now? Enormous cuts will be needed year on year at the end of this decade to make up for these lost years. In reality, the scale of those cuts, when required, will be such that they will be impossible to achieve in a single year.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I agree with the comments that Ms Marie Donnelly, the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, made at the sidelines of the COP to the effect that we need to tackle urgently some of the low-hanging fruit when cutting emissions here. In her comments, she specifically mentioned shallow retrofits, which we in Sinn Féin have been saying represent a considerable missed and available opportunity. Deep retrofitting is not happening at the scale required. The Minister's own figures show that. It is not credible to think that families across Ireland have a spare €30,000 to deep-retrofit their homes. I am not sure when the Government will realise that. Shallow retrofits and attic and cavity wall insulation are quick and affordable. In Sinn Féin's opinion, the State should be offering the full cost. Think of how many homes could be upgraded really quickly for a fraction of the price of a deep retrofit. It would deliver immediate carbon emissions reductions, help people save on their energy bills and improve health and well-being in the State's coldest homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> The numbers for shallow retrofits have fallen off a cliff. In 2011, even at the height of the economic crisis, 51,577 attic insulations were carried out. In 2020 and 2021, similar to 2019, before Covid, the figure had dropped to below 5,000 annually, representing a full decade of missed opportunity. At that pace, it would take 100 years to complete the works on the 500,000 homes that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has said would benefit from attic and cavity wall insulation. Therefore, I asked the Minister to heed Ms Donnelly's comments and focus heavily on shallow retrofits in the time ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Another issue that could be resolved quickly but that has not been to date is the under-resourcing of our planning system. The wind and solar industries have been banging this drum for some time. Some vital green-energy projects are caught in the system for far too long. Sinn Féin proposed in its alternative budget increased funding for our planning agencies and environmental NGOs to speed up planning applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">We need robust, thorough and quality planning procedures for renewable energy projects and decisions to be made in a timely manner. The renewables industry said the average decision time for a planning appeal is 60 weeks. The average decision time for a strategic infrastructure development, SID, is 69 weeks, versus a statutory objective to determine cases within 18 weeks. We need more inspectors, ecologists and legal and administrative staff. Offshore projects to develop offshore windfarms need to put together environmental impact assessment reports as part of their applications, informed by fish and marine life surveys, marine mammal surveys and years of bird surveys. Environmental NGOs play an important role in this. Therefore increased funding for them would help them to contribute to complex planning applications to ensure we protect our biodiversity as we expand our energy production.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> It is the same when it comes to our ports. Four Irish ports failed to secure EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility, but the State has not brought forward any alternatives. Belfast is the only port on the island currently capable of hosting the construction of offshore windfarms. If we do not invest and ready our ports now, we will lose jobs and supply chain business from multibillion euro projects to ports in Britain and elsewhere. Given the planning issues in ports, offshore wind experts I have spoken to are not confident that our 2030 target will be met and are mentioning 2035 more and more. I ask the Minister to assure the House that 2030 is still on target and there are plans to address the significant concerns around planning and port infrastructure. I mentioned foreshore licences, marine area consents and the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA. There are key timelines that need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Regarding transport emissions, Sinn Féin has proposed an increase of 10,000 places in the school transport scheme to harness the demand for the system and take thousands of cars off the roads every day. This has been inexplicably resisted to date. There is significant capacity to reduce our transport emissions if we provide the service. We have consistently argued with the National Transport Authority, NTA, about the need to reduce fares to encourage people to use public transport. It told us that was not the case and that we do not get the type of response indicated if fares are reduced. It said there is no clear correlation. We know now there is a clear correlation because we have empirical evidence, based on the impact of the 20% reduction in fares, which has seen significant increases in the uptake of public transport beyond what the NTA expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Separately, in terms of solar, farmers have asked about reforming the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant process to allow them to sell electricity to the grid and a change to the capital acquisition tax rules to encourage more solar on farms. Neither of those things has been considered. Farmers want to play their part but are not getting much co-operation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I refer to points made by the Minister at his party conference at the weekend when he discussed the increased ambition for solar energy, a doubling to 5 GW of the target included in the climate action plan and delivery five years ahead of what was originally scheduled. We keep having targets. It appears that, in the climate action plan there will be more targets, increased targets, shifting targets and a move away from electric vehicles, EVs, and offshore wind towards solar. We need delivery. We need the logistical or regulatory roadblocks and the planning and infrastructural barriers to be lifted. This needs to be a decade of delivery. That is what was demanded, not just at COP but at national level.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReadaCronin" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Deputy Réada Cronin<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_562">I would like to be associated with the remarks of an Teachta O'Rourke regarding the contribution of the Minister at COP27, as well as that of the Taoiseach. I am glad to speak about COP27. It feeds into the claims of climate deniers to say that COP has created so much hot air, it would make its own contribution to global warming.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> It is important to put climate in the media and public spotlight. This is somewhere climate definitely needs to be because, like it or not, climate change is not something that is happening in a far-off country. The impacts of climate change are coming home to us in Europe. There is more torrential rain, warmer oceans and hurricanes coming further north all the time. There are more landslides, wildfires, droughts, heatwaves and flash flooding, and agricultural land is being rendered useless or damaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Last year there were killer floods in France, Belgium and Germany. Large parts of Greece, Spain, Portugal and France went up in flames. At the weekend the island of Ischia was devastated by the Himalayan-type rain that is hitting Italy with more force and regularity. Europe knows about loss and damage, although it is up there with the USA in inflicting it on some of the poorer countries in the world. In terms of money, loss and damage, as laid out in COP27 it is Europe and the United States that will pay the largest amount into the fund. However, as China is the worst cumulative emitter in the world, apart from the US. it must also play its part.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Gordon Brown spoke about China and its responsibilities during the weekend. I agree with him. We need to establish funds rather than loans, because there is something wrong about climate hammered nations paying the so-called developed world for the damage inflicted on them. Trócaire and other groups spoke at the Committee on Environment and Climate Action about trying to get loss and damage onto the COP agenda. It was great that was done because funding needs to be established on the basis of rights and entitlement rather than doled out or dangled as favours.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The financial planning to make this happen is critical. This was the point I made yesterday to Jim Clarken, the executive director of Oxfam. When Trócaire, Oxfam, Christian Aid and others came to speak to us at the Committee on Environment and Climate Action a few weeks ago, they made powerful and alarming presentations about the scale of loss and damage being experienced and the scale of the response required. I was happy to speak to the Kenyan ambassador, Michael Mubea, about climate change issues raised at the committee in respect of the Wajir area of Kenya.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> There were excellent presentations at the committee earlier on the role of the media in communicating the climate crisis. The point was made that it is its job to communicate the scale of the crisis to us, given that we rely on the media to tell us what needs to change. So much of the media is owned by companies that may be resistant to the kind of profound change needed in our way of life. English language media, when talking about a heatwave, are still coming out with stock images of children at beaches with melting ice creams, with wildflowers behind them. It is kind of mad. It is welcome that the national broadcaster, RTÉ, is moving to address this in the context of climate change. As the old saying goes, when the last fish is eaten, the last tree is dead and the last drop of clean water is drunk, what use will money be to us then?</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> I realise there is criticism of COP, but the agreement on loss and damages at the eleventh hour is something that is to be welcomed. We now must pursue it vigorously because the Earth is changing underneath our feet. As a member of the Committee on Environment and Climate Action, a socialist republican and, especially, a new grandmother, I am worried about the world we are leaving to our children. I am especially anxious that we move with all speed to establish loss and damage funds to make sure the countries affected start to benefit from the funds immediately. It is in all our interests that we do that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DuncanSmith" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_569">Tackling climate change is an act of intergenerational and global solidarity, and the COP process is the only multilateral forum we have to do so. It is vital we make this process work. COP has shown it is able to deliver commitments and agreements, but action is what really counts. Realising the scale of the climate crisis we are facing, it is difficult not to be disheartened following the conclusion of COP27.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The establishment of the loss and damage fund, which will provide financial assistance to developing countries stricken by climate disaster, a measure which was first called for by small island nations 30 years ago, is a welcome takeaway from the conference. We know developing countries are the most adversely affected by the impacts of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">While we in the wealthy countries of the global north are still talking about prospective climate disasters landing on our shores, for many developing countries in the global south, the adverse effects of climate change have already arrived and with catastrophic effect. We have seen the flooding in Pakistan that has resulted in 1,700 deaths and millions more people being impacted and displaced, not to mention the devastating consequences the floods have had on Pakistan’s infrastructure. We have also seen a drought in the Horn of Africa that has left 22 million people facing a severe hunger crisis. Climate disaster is already a reality for some of the world’s most vulnerable countries and, closer to home, the soaring heatwaves experienced across Europe offer a sign of what is to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The loss and damage fund is a good step but it must be adequately and fairly funded. We know Ireland has the finances to contribute more to combating climate change globally than we currently do. Prior to COP27, our party leader, Deputy Bacik, called on the Taoiseach to show leadership and generosity in negotiations, and we echo that sentiment again now that the time has come to act on the commitments that have been made. We must contribute our fair share and take a leading role in holding other wealthy countries to account in contributing theirs. It is difficult to conclude that COP27 has done much otherwise to abate the cynicism the conference has generated in the past about its ability to go beyond agreements and commitments and to deliver real actions and outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> The summit’s concluding agreement, the Sharm el-Sheikh implementation plan, has called on countries to “revisit and strengthen” 2030 climate targets by the end of 2023 to “align with the Paris Agreement”, a reminder this Government so desperately needs. However, the agreement failed to advance ambition on the 1.5°C target, despite the fact that, under current trends, we will overshoot that target by more than 1°C. The science tells us we need emissions to peak before 2025, but this is left out of the plan and there is no clear commitment to phasing out fossil fuels. In fact, it more or less ignores the issue. It is extremely disappointing a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, something the Labour Party wholeheartedly endorses and called on the Government to sign up to prior to the summit, could not be agreed upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Regrettably, accusations of the COP summits as being all bark and no bite could just as easily be applied to this Government’s climate action plan. It is big on rhetoric but weak on delivery. Time and again it has shown it is not giving this existential crisis the attention it warrants. The last climate action plan was delayed significantly and not aligned with the fiscal budget as was promised. Carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings were not given proper time for debate before the Dáil rose in July this year and the Government delivered a ceiling that was below the optimal level for agriculture. A lower ceiling would be fine, except this Government has repeatedly shown itself to be incapable of even meeting its own targets. Just 45% of the 162 measures scheduled for April, May and June of this year were delivered on time, as per the latest climate action plan progress report. To date, nearly 25% of the measures promised have been delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Moreover, Ireland’s emissions grew in 2021, even when compared with pre-pandemic levels. The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded Ireland will be way off the target of a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and we remain among the highest emitters of greenhouse gases <i>per capita</i> in Europe - 60% above the EU average. Worse still, a recent report by the Economic and Social Research Institute shows our real carbon footprint is 70% higher than estimated when we account for consumption as well as production. However, the Government has shown its reluctance to hit the coffers of those making money from overconsumption in its hesitancy in implementing a windfall tax on energy company profits, a measure the Labour Party has been calling for since January.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> While the Government hums and haws about introducing piecemeal climate measures, we in the Labour Party have called for climate action to take centre stage and inform all other policy decisions. Our economy, infrastructure and services must be climate-proofed. We have advocated for meaningful and practical measures that will make a difference. We want greater investment to harness the enormous potential Ireland has to be a world leader in renewable energy. The influence petro states had on proceedings at COP27 has made headlines. We want Ireland to be a leading green state at COP summits in years to come, showing other countries there is an alternative. We want to create a sustainable agricultural sector, which is why we proposed a doubling of the organic farming scheme and capital investment for a new agricultural rooftop solar scheme grant. A just transition means our vital farmers and agricultural workers must also see the benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> We want to change the way we see transport in this country. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, recently acknowledged we need systemic change in our transport system to reduce our reliance on cars, and he is correct. That is why we proposed a €9 per month climate ticket for unlimited public transport, modelled on the hugely popular German scheme. We have also called for significant investment in modes of clean and active travel through an expansion of the cycle to work scheme and the further roll-out and expansion of the city bike scheme. These are simple measures that would help us to cut our emissions radically, reduce our systemic reliance on cars, and have the added benefit of shielding people from the rising cost of fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> We should acknowledge the tremendous advocacy the climate crisis has brought about among young people. We have seen groups of young people like Fridays for Future, among others, protesting outside the Dáil. They understand that, because of this generation’s inaction, they will be the ones picking up the pieces. One of the key messages to come out of the recent Children and Young People’s Assembly on Biodiversity Loss was, “Future generations must live in a world where there isn’t a crisis and where children don’t have to take action because of the incapability of past generations.”</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> In years to come, this Government’s legacy will be judged on its response to the climate emergency. After last year’s COP26 summit, the Taoiseach said “Climate action is a central tenet of the programme for Government”. However, the Government’s performance since then has left far too much to be desired. Despite this, we often hear from the Government that we are on the right path. Now is not the time for a leisurely stroll along this path; it is time for an outright sprint. It is time this Government took radical and meaningful action. It is time this Government, along with our friends who attended COP27, took the climate crisis seriously and delivered on the promises it has made.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_580">As we have heard, climate change is a stark reality for much of the world's population and it is happening much faster than scientists had predicted. This is evidenced by the many incidences of extreme weather events such as droughts, flooding and forest fires across the globe this year, which caused substantial loss of life and destruction on a massive scale. Many societies face an existential threat, as well as threats to global food supplies and security. That is why COP27 was so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The agreement reached in Sharm el-Sheikh was historic, albeit after prolonged negotiations. Ireland's objectives for these negotiations were the provision of funding for adaptation to climate change and the provision of finance for loss and damage for climate impacts. We have advocated for climate justice at the United Nations, including at the United Nations Security Council. As we know, agreement was reached on the establishment of a loss and damage fund. Developed countries have signed up to providing aid to the developing countries that are hardest hit by climate related disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> We can now be somewhat satisfied with the outcome of COP27. That said, as other speakers have pointed out, it was disappointing there was no further progress on achieving greater cuts to greenhouse gas emissions or on the ending of fossil fuel use. Limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C by 2050 remains the target. Work needs to commence as quickly as possible on setting up this fund and establishing how it will operate in practice. The Minister has said we need to broaden the contributor base by including financial institutions, aviation, shipping and the fossil fuel industry, and I fully agree with him on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> As other speakers have done in this House, I too pay tribute to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan. By all accounts he was central to determining the EU's approach to these talks and was in the thick of the negotiations to ensure a final compromise was reached in Egypt. His cross-departmental team is also to be complimented and we should make no apology for the size of our COP27 delegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> What can we do in Ireland? We need to stay the course with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and implement our climate action plan. We need to implement the necessary actions to achieve a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to set us on a path to reach net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Actions on agriculture, energy, industry, land use and waste must be taken. In this regard, it is disappointing to see how even the smallest of measures to tackle climate change are fiercely resisted in this House. All of us in this House need to show real leadership if we are to have any chance of saving our planet from oblivion.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> I would also like to say a few words about flood defences. We must ramp up construction of flood defences to protect cities, towns and homes generally. Melting ice caps mean a rise in sea levels. As regards my constituency, Dublin City Council is preparing plans for a Clontarf promenade and flood alleviation project. This involves the seafront from the wooden bridge at Dollymount up to the Alfie Byrne Road. Sandbags have been put in position at this location since 2014. The provision of these sandbags is quite costly and they are unsightly as well. The appointment of consultants for stage 1 has not yet happened. Comprehensive consultations will have to be organised with the local community on this scheme. Dublin City Council and the OPW will need to get a move on in this regard. I hope there will be no unnecessary delay in the construction of this flood defence scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">Like other speakers, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on his achievement. Multilateral discussion and negotiation is vital for progress in this area because otherwise we have beggar-your-neighbour policies, and that would bring us all down together. Mobilising countries to make these commitments is a difficult task because we even hear the free-rider argument being advanced here in Ireland, along the lines that we are only tiny and we should not be making an effort. What is encouraging is the USA and Brazil are much more engaged this time round, which is a source for some optimism. It is to be hoped China and India will also increase their commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> We had an interesting hearing today in our committee about how little research there is on how transformative change of this scale can be brought about by political action and not by some technological disruptive impact. There is very little research into how this is to be done but there is great consensus that we need a big system change.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Like Deputy Haughey, sometimes I despair when I come into this House and hear people who keep advocating for more and more ambition, but when it comes to basic changes that would change the system, like setting prices for activities that are damaging, they shy away and say they cannot have that, they just want subsidies for whatever pet projects they have. The reality is we must design new market structures, new regulations and new pricing regimes, and that will be very hard to negotiate with the public and on which to bring the public with us. We should set aside some of what I believe is cynical finger-pointing, be it at farming or data centres. They are not the issue here. We must bring about radical change in the way we live our lives, and there is no getting away from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> I have said this to the Minister of State previously. It is a pity his senior Minister and the Taoiseach are not here. It is that I believe the circular economy, of which he is the pioneer, is a big element of how we might successfully bring communities with us, because it embraces the wider issue of how we consume as well as how we produce. This week, the Minister of State will have seen the report from the ESRI where we generate 61 million tonnes of carbon in terms of production but our consumption is 107 million tonnes of carbon. We import embedded carbon of 65 million tonnes in products we bring into this country. That is enormous. That is the cars and construction materials we use. We do not have sufficiently circular concepts being applied in those marketplaces to cut down on the use of materials, to use them frugally and to recover them when they are at the end of their use. Let us not forget that while 55% of emissions come from fossil fuels, 45% come from these other materials we use without proper regard. The Minister of State should be banging the drum and asking the Taoiseach shortly to change. He must say the circular economy should be at the heart of the climate plan and that the concepts that are more embracing of the whole supply chain are the ones that can bring the public with us. I strongly advocate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> We saw today as well that young people are acutely conscious of the urgency of this but have little enough information as to how to bring it about. The circular concept can help people to be informed. I hope that if we keep knocking on the door of others, they will open it and put the Minister of State's work at the heart of the strategy.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanDillon" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_591">I thank the Minister of State for his update on the attendance by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, at COP27. Climate change is possibly the most important issue of our time, and our actions now will certainly affect what will happen for future generations. There are actions we can take now to reverse climate change and to support our transition to a low-carbon economy. Some of the biggest advances in technology have come from trying to limit and create alternatives to our dependency on carbon. As a Government, we must continue to focus on the decarbonisation of the electricity system to achieve our target of more than 70% renewable electricity by 2030, and to keep up with increasing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Ireland must also reinforce the electricity network and scale up the roll-out of renewable energy generation, and we must develop power storage solutions. Investment will be required like never before for areas such as solar, wave energy and windfarms to allow us to harness the power of nature in a clean way, harvesting energy without harming the environment and destroying habitats.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> As an island nation with no nuclear electricity, our ability to deliver on our net zero ambitions while safeguarding energy security through the continued role of natural gas beyond 2030 will be dependent on the timely arrival of emerging technologies. Major investment will therefore be needed to help decarbonise the gas network and make it compatible with a net zero future. We require policy and investment in this area to provide alternative solutions like green hydrogen production and the smart integration of the gas and the electricity systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> My county of Mayo has an abundance of renewable energy resources, including the potential to produce 2 GW of onshore wind, which can be delivered in a very short time. We are ideally located to become a natural, renewable energy and hydrogen hub. However, the Minister of State must be aware that the opportunity is time-limited. We must ensure the opportunity does not pass us by and that we have essential policy drivers in place to deliver on this potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> In July, I welcomed the Minister of State's consultation on the development of the hydrogen strategy for Ireland. That was an important step forward. What is equally important is the publication of the national green hydrogen strategy. Many people want to utilise the potential of this alternative. I have spoken to a number of developers who are anxious to get involved, and they want to know what incentives and financial supports the Government will provide in the strategy. That is an important step forward.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_596">We are talking about COP27. There are certain pieces we welcome in regard to loss and damage, which is the idea of compensation or reparation for those parts of the world that are already paying a huge price for the fact the world is on fire and for our failure as a global community to deal with issues relating to emissions. We all accept there has been an insufficient amount of movement, even in terms of the promises, never mind delivery, as regards moving away from fossil fuels. Some may not have been wedded to that idea for climate reasons, but the war in Ukraine proves to us why we must ensure we make the journey to renewables.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Everyone has said it at this stage: we could be the renewables superpower or the offshore wind superpower, but we know we are behind where we need to be on the basis of our planning infrastructure that is not fit for purpose. We must bring an end to the Attorney General's review and see what pieces can be addressed. At this point, we know we do not have ports that are fit to deliver the sort of infrastructure we will need.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">We just have to do all this better and faster. We have absolutely no choice. In that regard, the Government needs to show the ins and outs of how we are going to deliver the wins as regards solar energy, farming and anaerobic digestion, and green hydrogen across the board; whatever is needed. We have seen some wins in respect of public transport, some of which relates to financial incentives and the idea of reducing fares, but, as I said, it needs to be faster and better.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> The Minister of State will not die of shock when I raise the issue of district heating systems and, in particular, communal heating systems such as that in Carlinn Hall. Last week, the feasibility study into geothermal began. We need to change the heat source for these heating systems, whether to woodchip or geothermal. In any event, we need a grant scheme that will pay for this and sort out the matter. We also need a short-term mitigation plan to get people through the winter because they are dealing with ridiculous bills.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasGould" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_600">I echo the comments made by our party spokesperson on climate action, Deputy O'Rourke. Sinn Féin believes in more than just tackling climate change. We believe in a just transition to a sustainable, cleaner and better future life for all of us. We believe climate action can and must be achieved without penalising the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> It is amazing that after two and a half years in power, the Green Party has done little for those who are most at risk of harm or to tackle the behaviour of those who are causing the most harm to our environment. The average billionaire has a carbon footprint that is a million times greater than that of the poorest person, according to Oxfam. The top 1% are responsible for about 20% of global emissions. In July, it was reported that the US rapper Travis Scott had been flown in his private jet from Dublin to Clare, a two-and-a-half-hour drive. Unfortunately, there is no public transport option despite two and a half years of the Green Party being in government. In fact, the most recent figures pre-Covid, from 2019, show that 9,000 private jets flew into Irish airports, equating to 16 jets a day or one every hour and a half. Private jets emit up to 14 times more carbon than a commercial aeroplane. Flying a private jet from Dublin to Cork emits 2.2 tonnes of carbon, or the average output of a three-bedroom home in six months, yet after two and a half years in government, the Green Party still has not considered a single measure to tackle these private jets. Do not worry, however, because every time ordinary people turn on their lights or stoves or put petrol or diesel in their car to go to work or to take their children to school, they pay tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> The rapper Travis Scott once stated, “All I got is myself.” It is lucky for him that the Green Party is in power, keeping him, other millionaires and billionaires safe from climate taxes every ordinary person has to pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">I am glad the Minister is back in the Chamber because I want to take a moment to congratulate him and his political staff and the civil servants and NGO representatives who accompanied him to COP27 on the work they did. In particular, I congratulate him on his role as the lead EU negotiator during the negotiations regarding the loss and damage fund. It was meaningful work and it deserves recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> COP27 and the commitments made there, especially those relating to the loss and damage funding, are welcome, but the loss and damage fund is only one part of a complex issue. Developing nations do not just need us in the EU to write them a cheque when we cause irreparable damage to their lived environment through our consumption of fossil fuels; they need us not to inflict that irreparable damage in the first instance. Our responsibility for the devastating effects of climate change goes far beyond loss and damage funds. We need, throughout the EU, systemic change in how we consume energy, travel and farm, and that includes here in Ireland. System-wide change is the only way we are going to reduce our carbon emissions to levels that will allow us the time we need to reduce global warming and to get climate change under control.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> We know what this will look like. We need to invest heavily in solar and offshore wind energy and to incentivise behavioural change by making travelling on public transport the best option for everybody, including communities outside our major urban centres, that is, those in towns and villages. We need to increase our spending and get serious about biodiversity conservation because that issue and climate change need to be addressed in parallel and tackled together. To that end, I welcome the outcome of the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss at the weekend and the work it has also done in that area. I hope we will see a much greater focus on biodiversity conservation over the coming months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> The leadership the Minister gave at COP27 needs to be mirrored by what happens domestically here and as it stands, the report card on the Government's measures to meaningfully tackle climate change is not good. We need to recognise the reality, namely, that Ireland’s emissions increased last year. Our activity was greatly reduced by Covid at that time, yet we still managed to increase our emissions. Ireland has the second highest carbon emissions <i>per capita</i> in the EU, and no targets set by the Government have yet been met. We will not be judged by the number of targets that have been set; instead, generations will judge us on meeting those targets. While it might be nice, therefore, to make big announcements about proposed reductions on carbon emissions from behind a podium, if the Government consistently fails to meet those targets, at best it will look as though it was unable to get them done, while at worst it will have been just telling people what they wanted to hear and hoping they would not notice when it did not deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> I hate being cynical when it comes to environmental and climate work but after so many years of false starts and failures to reduce carbon emissions, it is difficult to be but a little cynical. I worked for 20 years in environmental science and 15 years ago, I worked in New South Wales in what was then called the greenhouse office, where we worked on climate adaptation measures. I have seen up close the impact climate change and pollution are having on our environment and our communities and it has been difficult, having had that experience, to come into politics, where we do not see the immediacy of the response that is needed or the immediacy of delivery. I am trying not to be cynical and to give constructive criticism because, as I said, we need the Minister's Government to deliver on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> As always on climate, Ireland talks the talk and at COP27, the Minister was tasked with walking the walk. He did that, but I am asking him to walk the walk at home as well, which means delivering on all the targets, actions and policies he has committed to over the past two and a half years. At the weekend, he spoke about a solar revolution and on expanding the delivery of solar within this country, which was welcome, but we need to see how the Government is going to achieve that. A few months ago, coming up to the budget, we heard about a rooftop revolution, but I have not heard anything about it since. I asked how large a budget was being assigned to that but I do not think any money was assigned to it. There did not seem to be a plan. I hope all this talk from last week will not end up similarly as just sound bites and not actions, because we need action. We in the Social Democrats have put forward a feasible, pragmatic and possible plan for how we could quickly, efficiently and cheaply deliver solar to 1 million homes, which would not only help people reduce their energy costs but also help reduce our emissions, which is critical, and the pressures on the grid. Will the Minister taking those proposals on board? We need to get that done.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Turning to a couple of items mentioned by other Government Deputies, there was a reference to cynical finger-pointing at data centres. To be clear, no fingers are being pointed at data centres; what is happening is finger-pointing at successive Governments that have failed to plan or strategically manage these large energy users and, therefore, have failed our communities and our energy grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> There was also a comment about flood defences.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">We absolutely need to ramp up flood defences. We need to make sure that we adapt because climate change is here and it is going to impact on us. We need to adapt our communities for that. Flood defences should not just solely be engineering solutions. We need to look upstream. We need to work with the environment to provide the solutions when it comes to the potential of flooding. That means looking upstream and making sure we are flooding areas that should naturally be flooding and that will actually protect our towns and villages downstream.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak about COP27. It is great that we are all here today dedicating our time to do so. The climate crisis is the biggest threat facing us and it is not a future threat. It is a current threat. It is here and now and deserves to be treated as the most pressing issue we face as a human race. Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case, globally or here at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The two main priorities for this year’s Conference of the Parties were scaling up climate finance for climate resilience and addressing climate-induced loss and damage. I was particularly pleased that climate-related loss and damage took centre stage because those who have contributed least to the creation of the climate emergency are often those who are suffering the most. They are suffering through the extreme adverse effects of the climate crisis including rising temperatures and rising sea levels. It is a threat to their livelihoods and, indeed, their very lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Developing countries are already offering grim modelling of what is to come in other parts of the world. That is grossly unfair and unjust. The agreement that was reached at COP27 when it comes to loss and damage is historic and really progressive. I want to praise the Minister and the Irish delegation for the central role they played in getting the agreement over the line. In particular, I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, who has been really proactive in this space.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> We all accept that it does not go as far or as fast as we and our EU partners would have liked. Having a deal to build on is better than no deal at all, however. This new agreement will hopefully have life-changing results for the millions of people, mostly in the developing world, whose land, water sources and livelihoods are being eroded every day because of the impacts of climate change. We have to do everything we can to help developing countries that are especially vulnerable. Inherent in this deal is an admission that richer nations have contributed most to the climate emergency through our emissions and bad practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I also really welcome the commitment to keeping 1.5°C alive, which is a commitment to ensuring that global warming stays within a 1.5°C increase above pre-industrial levels. Without climate mitigation efforts, everything else truly is in vain. If we can remain focused on delivering on our commitments around emissions and warming then it follows that we will have less loss and less damage that will need to be paid out. Mitigation must remain the number one priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> I have been lucky enough to have had many brilliant schoolchildren and groups into Leinster House for tours this year, such as Holy Family Community School, Griffeen Community College and Coláiste Bríde. It is always top of their minds. As I said previously in this House, the time of climate change is behind us. We are now very much living through a climate emergency. We have the plan and record investment and we have set the targets. Not delivering on those targets or meeting those agreements is simply not an option. It starts at home in all of our everyday practices but the prime example must be set by the State; it simply has to be. We owe it to our younger generations and all those who have been so vocal on this to deliver on our commitments.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">I thank the Minister for his very significant contribution to COP27 alongside the Taoiseach. Most importantly, however, I thank the civil servants who played a very significant role in getting this historic agreement over the line. It seems like every Conference of the Parties has a historic agreement. The importance of delivery is not lost on the Minister or, indeed, the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Despite several urgent crises developing across the world, COP27 saw no diminution of the Paris Agreement, which is crucial in our collective global efforts to reduce our carbon emissions. As has been said on multiple occasions, every country needs to play its part in this process of not just hitting our targets or the notional targets of others for 2030 but also those of the Paris Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Historic commitments to develop a loss and damage fund have been agreed in order to address the unfolding climate impacts on developing countries and is extremely important. I welcome it wholeheartedly. Of course, we are left with the very real need to develop tangible benefits for those countries affected the most and to ensure there is no backsliding in years to come on the part of other wealthy nations. I am confident that this country will not do so but I am not so confident about quite a number of others in terms of what we must do to try to achieve these targets to mitigate against the use of the fund in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> A new green renewable hydrogen forum has also been launched with an aim of enhancing investment in green renewable hydrogen. Of course, here, we remain in need of a clear hydrogen strategy. We know this technology will play a very significant role on the coming decades, particularly with regard to the storage of energy. By acting now, we can prepare ourselves for an energy infrastructure to incorporate this new method of storage into use in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I would like to draw attention to the figures that were published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, today, however, which show that Ireland is well below the European average for expenditure on research and development. While it is not specifically the Minister's Department, it should set concerning alarm bells ringing regarding the sorts of research and development that we perhaps could and should be instigating here, particularly with regard to battery storage and offshore wind technology, which will undoubtedly play a very significant role in this jurisdiction in the coming years. To see that we have fallen behind in research and development in comparison to our European counterparts is of concern. I ask the Minister perhaps to throw an eye over that to see what his Department can do in conjunction with his Cabinet colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The European Union has committed to a €1 billion fund for climate adaptation in Africa, including early warning systems, internal climate adaption programmes and new risk and insurance systems. These are all to be welcomed but again, achieving the targets that have been set at previous Conferences of the Parties and by the Paris climate agreement is of paramount importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> As the Minister will know, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in conjunction with the ESRI, published a report yesterday regarding the attitudes and behaviours of young people in Ireland with regard to climate change. In fact, representatives from the ESRI appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action this morning for a fascinating discussion on views held by young people. The vast majority of those views are not a surprise to the vast majority of Members of this House, particularly by those who are paying attention. It showed a massive ambition on the part of young people. Deputy Higgins mentioned school tours. It is always the first subject they want to talk about alongside housing. They always want to talk about climate. As was highlighted today, we do not need a specific curriculum within our education system to teach children about climate change and the importance of climate action. They know it already. This study on the part of the ESRI in conjunction with the EPA shows that our children - the next generation - and the 18 to 24-year-olds who were surveyed know exactly what is required. They know that massive sacrifices will be required on the part of every economy across the country and every citizen within those economies. That is the point on which I wish to conclude. We must recognise, if anybody is uncertain, that we must make changes to our lifestyles because if we do not, we will not hit our targets. Missing those targets will, ultimately, cost lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">As a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I welcome the opportunity to examine the outcome of the most recent UN Conference of the Parties that was held in Sharm El-Sheikh from 6 to 20 November. I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier update on the conference. I congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on their work at COP27. I particularly welcome the Taoiseach's comments about the need for urgent delivery and a swift transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The breakthrough at the conference to support least developed countries through a loss and damage fund is particularly welcome. Island nations such as Vanuatu, as referenced by the Taoiseach earlier, are at extreme risk as are people across Africa and Southeast Asia. It is important that developed countries support these nations as they transition to net zero.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> While the full details of the loss and damage fund are to be finalised, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to ensure that the fund includes very robust controls to ensure the monies are directed to those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Here in Ireland, the focus must be on a fast transition and we need to see far more urgency in areas like solar, retrofitting and upgrading the public transport network. </p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be aware that I have raised in the past his own suggestion that solar panels be installed on the homes of people obliged to use additional energy as a consequence of a medical illness. Unfortunately, progress has been far too slow in this regard. Likewise, there has been slow progress on ensuring people with solar panels can sell surplus power back to the grid. </p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I would like to see further action on shallow and full retrofits. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, the retrofitting of council homes is moving far too slow and it will take 50 years to retrofit the 4,500 units there. </p>
          <p eId="para_632"> As I have raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, equally in the past, we need to see an accelerated roll-out of improvements to public transport services, particularly in Dublin, with a continued focus on rail and Luas extensions. These projects are critical for the new communities being developed as part of the Housing for All programme. </p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Unfortunately, my time is limited here today but I also would have liked to touch on wind power, forestry and food security. I welcome the additional funding announced in announced in budget 2023. It is clear that funding is available. Now we need to see delivery as neither Ireland nor the world cannot wait.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">The devastating impact of global warming is clear for all to see. The vast majority of us realise we have to reduce our emissions, to cut our carbon footprint and urgent action is needed across the State. We have seen much talk with this Government on the action that is needed. I agree with the previous Government speaker in saying that the pace is glacial.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> We need a fair retrofit plan which will help meet our climate targets and when I say a "fair retrofit plan" I am speaking on behalf of our constituents. I am speaking about families living in Glover's Court, Mercer House and Pearse House. The conditions they are living in are completely unacceptable and, in many cases, shocking. They do not see any change. Egypt and Cairo are 6,000 km away and it is even further if one is living in a flat complex in Dublin, because they do not see any likelihood of their homes being retrofitted or insulated. Of course, the council will say that it is doing what it can with the resources it has. Ultimately, however, the Government is not giving the resources that are required and needed to retrofit flat complexes with the speed that is required. Many of the communities we represent are being excluded and forgotten about. Working families are facing very significant pressures with the cost of living and the vast majority do not have €20,000 or €30,000 to invest in a deep retrofit.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Dublin City Council tenants living in Pearse House or Leo Fitzgerald House cannot insulate their own homes as the council will not let them. They have to wait for the Government and it has firmly placed residents living in the flat complexes in the back of the bus. It is highly unfair that families are being left in the conditions they are subjected to by Dublin City Council and by the Government. Many of these flats have the worst energy ratings going, where many of these homes were built in the 1940s and 1950s and have little or no insulation, with a heat loss that is insanely high. The Government has to commit to resource Dublin City Council to ensure that the flat complexes and regeneration are fast-tracked, otherwise we have failed as a society to support Dublin City Council’s housing tenants.</p>

          <p eId="para_637"> The war in Ukraine has brought home the risks of dependence on volatile fossil fuels. The floods in Pakistan, the drought in the Horn of Africa, and European heatwaves and flash floods, have given us a glimpse of what the future looks like if we do not make significant progress. The Government must take bold action, reduce energy poverty and wean the country off fossil fuels and it must be a just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I am concerned about the recent rise in the cost of charging electric vehicles. If we do not get a handle on this it will threaten electrical car sales where they are only beginning to grow steadily. While electric cars are not the only answer, we must ensure that they remain an affordable option. The scientists who produced the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report has said that we need deep and immediate cuts in polluting emissions. In the words of the UN Secretary-General, investing in a new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness. President von der Leyen, who will address the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas, has said that COP27 has confirmed that the world will not backtrack on the Paris Agreement and that it is an important step towards climate justice. We need a little less climate conversation and a great deal more climate action. While COP27 agreed international action, we need a better response here at home to ensure we play our part. </p>
          <p eId="para_639"> It is good that we finally have sectoral emissions ceilings, even if they do not yet match the national ceiling. Now we have to deliver the measures which will ensure we live within the carbon budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> At COP26 in Glasgow, Ireland became a founding member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance led by Denmark and Costa Rica and my colleague Chris MacManus, MEP, was delighted to vote for the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty last month. We need more actions like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> Earlier this year I attended a briefing in the audiovisual room on the joint recommendations from 42 organisations on how to tackle energy poverty and energy pollution at the same time. Forty-two groups as diverse as Friends of the Earth, Pavee Point, Age Action, Oxfam and everywhere in between, were there.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I will finish with this point. We have the roadmap and we know what needs to be done. In the words of Greta Thunberg, less "blah, blah blah" and more action.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_643">I want to start by being absolutely honest about COP27 from my perspective. It has been a colossal failure and nothing of real substance has been achieved. As one report noted, it will make no difference whatsoever, the fossil fuel industry will continue to expand, greenhouse gas emissions will increase and the climate crisis will get worse. As if to copper-fasten this, the Minister granted a licence to Europa Oil &amp; Gas (Holdings) plc before he flew to Egypt. We will see thousands, if not millions of tonnes of additional CO2 being released into the atmosphere as a result of that decision if the company is successful. That, indeed, will fly in the face of the science and will lock us into decades of more reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> What should we say about the much-lauded loss and damage fund. I know plenty of NGOs and individuals who have welcomed it and I respect their view but I am extremely doubtful of its effectiveness and of its likely success. The details are hopelessly vague or, more accurately, completely non-existent. We do not know where the money is to come from, when or how it will come. We are told that a transitional committee will be set up by world governments, which will then work with a view to operationalising the funding arrangements. They will invite:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_645">international financial institutions to consider, at the 2023 Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, the potential for such institutions to contribute to funding arrangements, including new and innovative approaches, responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">To translate that into English, next year we will set up a committee to look into inviting private institutions to consider funding a possible fund. We will trust the future of vulnerable nations and peoples to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and will look at innovative approaches to funding arrangements. What could go wrong? When has the World Bank or the IMF ever let down the people of the developing world or indeed workers and ordinary people anywhere? The Minister is aware that I am being entirely ironic when I ask that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> While the failure on the actual emissions and the supposed deal on loss and damage have made the headlines, I want to highlight what I believe to be another major failure of COP27. This is the continued support for carbon markets and carbon trading as a mechanism to curb emissions. People Before Profit has long argued that the carbon trading system and the very idea of carbon credits is a set-up for fraud and utter failure. It is simply a medieval indulgence to allow for continued fossil fuel use. Whatever hope there was in this system must surely have rested on the fact that it should be open and transparent and where we could see what was working and what was not, even in the logic of a carbon market. Incredibly, however, COP27 has made even that idea more remote. There is an excellent summary on the website called <i>climateandcapitalism.com.</i></p>
          <p eId="para_648">It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_649">COP27 managed to take a giant leap in the wrong direction when governments agreed two paragraphs on confidentiality and Article 6. The first paragraph starts as follows: "The participating Party may designate information provided to the Article 6 technical expert review team during the review as confidential."</p>
          <p eId="para_650">There goes openness and transparency. One observer stated: "The confidentiality provisions on [Article] 6.2 are [so] embarrassing. You could drive a space shuttle through that loophole and have plenty of room on all sides."</p>
          <p eId="para_651">This guarantees that we will have more fraudulent accounting of emissions, allows for more global emissions and profiteering and shores up a system of three decades or more of catastrophic failure to rein in the fossil fuel interests driving this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> COP28 will be no different from COP27 and the answer to the crisis lies outside the conference halls of the great and the good. It lies with those fighting for global justice against a capitalist system that is causing the crisis. There is no hope in the mechanisms of market and capital, but there is hope in young people who are correctly identifying that we need system change and to stop the rush for profits, and that we need to see it as the cause of our planet overheating.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> Is the Minister aware of Ronan Browne, a young student in UCD who has been on hunger strike since last Wednesday? Mr Browne intends to go on thirst strike tomorrow. His desperation to highlight this crisis and demand action has brought him to this point, namely, endangering his own life? I ask the Minister to take note of that and visit or make contact with Ronan Browne. Young people are in a desperate panic about what is happening to the planet and their future. They mobilise and fight back but they feel very frustrated about it. It behoves the Minister, as the person responsible, to answer that young man and persuade him to fight back against the system but not to take any chances with his own health and life.</p>

          <p eId="para_655">I congratulate the Minister on and thank him for his recent important work on behalf of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> I will discuss wind energy, particularly offshore wind energy. I want to highlight two points. The first is the proposal near my constituency for the Kish and Bray banks. I support offshore wind energy completely. The opportunity for cheaper electricity, energy security and to shift away from fossil fuels to renewable sources is a no-brainer. When the proposal was put forward, I, like everybody who saw it, had many questions, such as the following. Why does it have to be put there? Could it not be put further out? What about the impact on the seabed? Should I be concerned about that? How will the energy come back in? These are natural questions people have in any case, but particularly with a big physical change.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> My approach and that of the Fine Gael Party has been to get and provide information in a factual way to people. They are located there because there is a deep sea channel in the Irish Sea which makes if difficult to put things further out. People say they have seen fixed turbines located 80 km off the coast of Denmark. Why can we not do that here? The reason is that there is a deep sea shipping channel, which is why Dublin Port is where it is. These are reasonable questions and people deserve answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> On biodiversity, there was a lot of concern among local coastal groups and it is always important to raise any such concerns. I got very good answers from the Department of the marine on that. I went further and spoke to the Climate Change Advisory Council on the matter and to the excellent Yvonne Buckley in Trinity College Dublin, who has carried out significant studies on the opportunity for new ecosystem development at the bases of fixed turbines. It is clear from that body of research that, first, the question does not take account of the biodiversity impact of the <i>status quo</i> and the failure to shift from fossil fuels to renewables. Second, it is clear from the emerging evidence that new topographies on the seabed create their own space free from shipping and other interference, where new ecosystems can develop. That is a significant opportunity. As far as I can see from the academic research, going beyond what is provided by the Departments, it is firmly favourable.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> In the context of offshore wind energy, we have a significant opportunity off the west coast, in particular in relation to floating wind energy. There is concern around security. It is not apparent from a policy perspective that we are having a conversation around security, either in terms of delivery or design considerations. The Garda Síochána Act 2004 indicates that gardaí have jurisdiction as far out as the continental shelf, but we need a policy conversation about how that will work and where security will be vested, whether in the Defence Forces or not. That is not just for physical security but also as a crisis response. It is obvious from the attack by rogue regimes in the Baltic on Gazprom that these new pieces of infrastructure could become targets of such regimes and of disruption to the European or Irish energy grid. It is important that conversations are held now with developers and designers, as well as at Government level, about managing the physical security around offshore floating wind energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Ireland has the opportunity to be the centre of gravity in Europe for offshore wind energy. It is nothing but an opportunity but I worry. We will not meet our 2030 target of 7 GW but we should press on anyway because the opportunity is so significant. Once that machine starts going and developers see trapped electrons coming onshore, it will accelerate and expedite. The one policy piece I would press with the Minister relates to a conversation now, not later, on building physical security into design information stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">I had the privilege in 2018 of attending COP24 in Katowice, Poland. It is difficult to imagine a construct less conducive to effective decision-making than the structure the Minister dealt with at COP27. In that context, I congratulate him for snatching victory, in certain terms, particularly on the issue of compensation for poorer countries for the damage inflicted on them by the developed world. That is a significant development but it is possible to argue there was some regression from progress made in COP26. The terminology in COP26 concerned the phase down of unabated coal and phase out of inefficient fuel subsidies. There was no mention in the conclusions of COP27 of progress on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> While acknowledging the Minister's achievement, I urge him to be cautious of failure to build on the commitments achieved. They are not insignificant. They have been around for 30 years but it is the first time tangible progress has been made on them in terms of compensation for the most affected nations, the small island nations literally in danger of being drowned by our failure to act in time on climate issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I urge the Minister to engage with Simon Steele of the United Nations, who is the chief architect of this structure, on the reform of it. Two things need to be done. The structure is like the ploughing championship on steroids. Is it any wonder the outcomes are compromised when Saudi Arabia has a pavilion of 1,000 sq. m while Malawi has 9 sq. m? Nepal and Afghanistan are not represented at all. Large corporations with deep pockets are wine and dining and doing deals on the margins. We need to separate the jamboree element of it. I acknowledge we need engagement with the fossil fuels industry. We need just transition and to use natural gas and liquefied natural gas as a way of transitioning out of dependence on fossil fuels. However, we need the jamboree out of the way before decision-makers of 200-plus nations gather to make real decisions. The construct in place at the moment is not conducive to effective decision-making. The Minister could usefully insist and demand in the coming 12 months that there be a change in that decision-making process. That is critical. There were 45,000 attendees and 600 registered lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">It is a cocktail that is designed to impair rather than facilitate progress on the critical issues of our time.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> I wish to make an observation about the climate debate in Ireland. I agree with the points made by others about the poverty of the climate debate domestically, which is reduced almost to a finger-pointing exercise. Depending on where one comes from, I will defend farmers and somebody else will defend the gas guzzlers lining up outside south County Dublin schools to pick up children. We all need to contribute more. If we were to resolve the issues of data centres or agriculture as their critics would have them, we would still have an enormous amount to do. We need to broaden that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> One of the areas where we are missing a trick is on mainstreaming the approach to the circular economy. The early motto of the environmental movement was reduce, reuse, recycle, and we need to re-embrace that. I welcome the progress announced during the week on the incentives to recycle plastic bottles to meet targets which puts a greater onus on plastic recycling. That is important. It is important to acknowledge that more demanding directives are coming from the EU now. That is a way to engage the broader population on a genuine commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> The term “conspicuous consumption” was used in a different context in terms of people’s purchasing power and how offensive it can be. We need to apply the term “conspicuous consumption” in the context of the climate change agenda. We are all, as consumers, conspicuously consuming excessively and contributing to the damage we are doing our global environment. By embracing reduce, reuse, recycle and repair, there is a pathway for all citizens to engage in a constructive positive way in the climate change agenda because we all need to change our <i>modus operandi</i>, namely, the manner in which we engage, the manner in which we consume and the manner in which we spend our hard-earned money. That is how we can get greater buy-in from the public on the climate change agenda, which is the challenge of our time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_668">I congratulate the Minister on his work and on that of the Irish team in progressing the issue of loss and damage, which is a very positive and very significant aspect of the negotiations. It is imperative that we are seen to deliver on that. It must not just be governments that deliver on it but also the big polluters out there. The oil industry and the airline industry also need to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> There is a misconception among the public that what happens a COP relates to the implementation of targets and all that is happening is that we are negotiating targets and reviewing the targets that were already set. However, we in Ireland and people in Europe and across the globe need to start focusing on implementing this legislation and these targets rather than just talking about the targets. I find that very frustrating. We set ourselves a target of reducing our overall emissions between now and 2030 by a further 48%, which will be a monumental task over the next eight years. We really need to focus on implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> When the Minister visited my home town of Athlone over the weekend, he made that very point and outlined the measures that need to be implemented. We need to drive innovation if we are to achieve that. That innovation will require long-term investment in research. Science Foundation Ireland is now involved in that. I hope that will bring about solutions post 2030. However, we need to look at practical implementable solutions in the short term between now and 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I will put three of those to the Minister, all of which come within the remit of the Green Party in government. The first relates to air quality. The warmth and well-being pilot I launched in 2016 to target people with chronic respiratory disease who are in fuel poverty has been found to be a phenomenal success. Research independently produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was presented in the Oireachtas two weeks ago. It shows that where we carry out deep retrofits of the homes of people with respiratory diseases who are living in fuel poverty, such individuals end up attending their GPs and emergency departments less frequently, require less use of hospital services and use fewer prescribed drugs. This is a win for climate, a win for health services and a win for the people with these chronic illnesses. If we are to capitalise on that, we need to invest in the retrofitting of homes of people in fuel poverty and those of individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. As the Minister knows, there is no scheme to invest in the homes of people with chronic respiratory diseases. However, there is a commitment to deliver retrofitting for the homes of people in fuel poverty. The difficulty is that it is taking nearly three years to carry out retrofitting where people have submitted applications for that. This is far too slow. We need to prioritise the retrofitting of homes, particularly the homes of those in fuel poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> I wish to speak about land use and land use change. As the Minister knows, we set a target within the agriculture sector of reducing emissions by 25% between now and 2030. While many people are willing to kick farmers and the agriculture community, very little by way of carrot is being doled out to the agricultural sector. We could have a win-win situation by encouraging farmers to sequester carbon and be rewarded for it. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has pointed out that mitigating greenhouse gases alone will not get us to net zero. We need to increase our carbon stocks in our soil, hedges and trees. To do that we need to measure the carbon that is already there. We need a reporting and verification process. Our colleagues in Northern Ireland have already started to roll that out field by field and hedge by hedge, but we are not doing it. We have decided to pick 20 pilot locations around the country. Sadly, even the pilot locations we have picked are 20 cm too short because in order to meet the internationally verified specification for soil carbon, it is necessary to go 30 cm into the ground. Our pilots are only going 10 cm into the ground, meaning we cannot even use the evidence we are producing here to put a baseline in place. We should be replicating what is being done in Northern Ireland and do a complete assessment of soil carbon right across the country in every single field and incentivise farmers to increase the content of carbon in our soil, hedges and forests across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> My final point relates to broadband. As the Minister knows, the national broadband plan is being rolled out across the country, delivering high-speed broadband to 37% of our population in the most isolated rural locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">It has the potential to reduce dramatically our transport emissions if we can encourage people either to work from home or in the digital hubs that are being constructed around the country. We have already delivered 300 of those hubs around the country and we need to put a pro-active approach in place to engage with employers to use those hubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> There is another thing that we need to do. By the middle of next year, there will be 30,000 homes with fibre cable outside their doors. As a result of that, the wireless antennae, and people have been availing of wireless technology up to now, will be decommissioned. I want to see the Minister recycling and redeploying that equipment to more isolated rural areas, providing those people with wireless broadband technology pending the delivery of the fibre solution. The only way to achieve that, I believe, is to give publicly owned sites, free of charge to those wireless companies to deploy that technology. I have already put this to the Minister and he has said to me that he will look at the proposal. We need to start seeing delivery on that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_676">I appreciate the Acting Chair for coming back to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Is ar ábhar tromchúiseach atá an díospóireacht seo. Níl aon amhras ann ach go bhféadfaimis a bheith ag féachaint ar ghéarchéim dáiríre agus go bhféadfadh tionchar a bheith aige, ní hamháin ar an tír seo, ach ar an domhan ina iomlán, ar eacnamaíocht an domhain agus ar phobail ar fud an domhain, go mór mór iad siúd sna tíortha ina bhfuil ioncaim ísle.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The situation we face is undoubtedly urgent, grave and requires urgent action. In the past couple of years, discussions such as those at COP27 have become part of the domestic political calendar and have attracted more attention. As ever, there is a mixture of positive and disappointing outcomes. I welcome the establishment of the loss and damage fund, which will channel funding from richer countries to countries that will be the most impacted by climate change. It is undoubtedly the case that typically the poorer countries will see the worst effects and in developed countries it will be the poorer citizens who will see the greatest effects. Wealthier countries account for just 12% of the population but they are responsible for 50% of the greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels in industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> We have a crucial role. We are a small country. It is not just a matter of the emissions that we expend, although <i>per capita</i> ours is well above much of the rest of the world. Every State has its responsibility and we must play our part and demonstrate leadership. Ireland missed its emissions cuts last year, we missed it in the previous year and we will likely miss it again this year. That is a cause for huge concern. We need significant resourcing of our planning agencies to speed up offshore delivery and a number of items, including the whole area of public transport. I have to acknowledge that there has been progress in relation to that and I welcome the announcement about Cork metropolitan rail today. More that can be done but it is significant and hopefully it will take a lot of cars off the road. Despite progress in that area, there is a lot of work that needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> I acknowledge some of the work that our spokesperson, Deputy Darren O’Rourke, has done over the last couple of years. In particular, the Green Hydrogen Strategy Bill 2022 identifies the lack of a Government plan to develop this source of green energy that holds big potential for Ireland and that can play a crucial role. It goes hand-in-hand with the role that will be played by wind energy and particularly offshore wind energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> There is also the Planning and Development Regulations (Amendment) (Solar Energy for Schools and Community Buildings) Bill 2022. I will come back to it in a second, but it is a crucial area and it is low-hanging fruit for solar panels, schools and community buildings. There is also the public transport document which he been published, and which identifies where progress can be built on in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Finally, there is the document that we produced recently, Schools as a Catalyst for Climate Action. As education spokesperson, I had some role in developing it. If the Minister has not seen it, I ask that he consider it. It identifies a number of areas, such as curriculum. There has been progress in recent years in relation to the leaving certificate but there is still much more scope at primary and indeed at early years levels, obviously in an age-appropriate way, to ensure that climate change and sustainable development education are integrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> In terms of the bricks and mortar side of it, there are 4,000 schools that would love to have solar panels. It is a no-brainer for them because it could generate energy when the schools are closed and because it would save money for schools that are already cash strapped. Schools are already places in which there is a huge awareness. We see green flags on countless schools across the State. They are already leaders in lots of ways. To me, therefore, it is a no-brainer and we need to expedite it. Those regulations went out for consultation. I would rather they were progressed; we need to progress them to ensure that they can happen and to back up the budgetary commitment, which we welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> In the last seconds I have, I will raise the issue of school transport. Every child who wants a place should be able to get a place in a medium term. It makes sense for emissions, for traffic, for the cost for parents and for everyone.</p>

        <speech by="#JackieCahill" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_685">I am delighted to get this opportunity to talk about the challenges that are facing us and the result of COP27. I am a farmer and proud of it. Thankfully, the next generation has gone into partnership with me. With every sinew of energy that I have, I will fight to protect rural Ireland and our production base. Yes, we have to meet the challenges of climate change, but if that hinders our ability to produce food for the world in a sustainable manner, we are failing in meeting that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Last week in Tipperary, we had two very good news stories as regards climate change. First, we got planning permission for the Lisheen by-products campus, which is adjacent to the old Lisheen Mine. This is a major step forward for us. I believe in a just transition for rural Ireland that sees climate-friendly policies and practices that are both economically and environmentally sustainable being adopted. With industries like this, we are proving the important role that rural Ireland and the agricultural industry must and will play as we fight climate change while also enjoying spinoffs of local and rural employment. This facility will create 30 jobs. It will also produce renewable electricity for 33,000 homes. It will reduce our emissions by 0.3%. That might seem small, but it is through small steps that we will reach our emissions targets. This campus will use waste from the agrifood industry as well as brown bin waste. To me, industries like this are the way forward. I have been working on this for a number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Also this week, there was an announcement of €1 million for the national bioeconomy campus again on the Lisheen site. Professor Kevin O’Connor and his team in UCD are constantly coming up with initiatives and technology to help the agrifood industry meet its targets and I was delighted that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine gave €1 million to that campus this week. That site in Lisheen has unique characteristics and zoning. We also need a master plan for that site, and I ask the Minister to use his influence at the Cabinet table to get funding for a master plan for that Lisheen site. I am certain that more industries will follow, in the same way that the bioeconomy industry was announced this week, with technology that will help us in our battle to reduce our emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> We put €90 million aside in the budget this year to put solar panels on farm buildings. That needs to be extended to any emission savings that can be done on farms, whether that is through the aeration of slurry tanks, putting rubbers on slats etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Numerous initiatives are now coming forward that can reduce emissions at farm level without impacting on the ability of the farm to produce food. I urge the Minister to extend the scheme for solar panels on farm buildings announced in the budget to other technologies to allow us to reach our 25% target without hindering our ability to produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I am the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I will refer to peat and our inability to issue licences for its harvesting. If we are going to meet the challenges of climate change, everyone has to bat together and be on the one side. It is inconceivable that we are failing to give licences to harvest peat for the horticulture industry, a homegrown industry that produces food in a natural way, is an example of the circular economy and involves nurseries, mushroom producers and so on. All that is needed to supply peat for the industry is 0.1% of our bogs. Despite assurances from various Ministers the situation was going to be sorted out, we have consistently failed and left our horticulture and nursery industry to import peat from other countries in Europe. That does nothing for us economically and it most definitely does nothing to reduce our emissions. Legislation is in place to allow peat to be cut on bogs smaller than 30 ha but we are not able to get licences issued. I urge the Minister to use his influence at the Cabinet table to get that issue sorted out. It will benefit everyone in trying to meet our targets.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marc Ó Cathasaigh<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach for giving me the opportunity to get out of the Chair slightly early so that I could take a speaking slot. Although it might seem frivolous, when reflecting on the achievements and otherwise of COP 27, I think of the Sergio Leone film, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". We saw much of each. I will work back, beginning with the ugly. Before COP 27 ever convened, I spoke about my unease with Coca-Cola acting as a title sponsor and my unease in respect of Egypt's record of human rights abuses. I was very taken by Deputy Creed's contribution earlier in this debate. He spoke about the jamboree or circus surrounding COP 27. There is no doubt it is an unwieldy process. It absolutely is, but it is the best we have until something better comes along. There is no way to deal with this issue other than through multilateralism. Deputy Creed has been out there and his experience is invaluable. Perhaps there are ways to reform it but, at the moment, it is the best we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> To work backwards to the bad, there were disappointments in this COP, as the Minister knows well. There was a significant watering down in this language about low emissions technology, which leaves the door open for fossil fuels. We need to move our language towards the phasing out of fossil fuels and away from last year's language of phasing them down. That is not good enough and will not get us where we need to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The bad and the ugly were rolled together in the presence of 600 fossil fuel industry lobbyists. As Deputy Creed said, many small island developing states and African countries will have been able to afford to send far fewer representatives than the fossil fuel companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> I will join with others in noting that it was very difficult to get the issue of loss and damage funding on the agenda for this COP. It was only included at the very last minute. It was a significant mark of respect for the Minister's leadership in this area that he was chosen to be the EU's chief negotiator on what was the most contentious and fundamental issue of this COP. It was a huge achievement on the part of the Minister himself and, more importantly, the dedicated team of civil servants he brought with him, who achieved an incredible amount of work in a short space of time. In describing how the impact of climate change on vulnerable countries has been ignored, the environment correspondent from the BBC, Matt McGrath, not to be confused with Deputy Mattie McGrath, said, "For decades the victims of a changing climate were the ghosts the richer world just couldn't see." I found that very poignant because many of those small island developing states - I think of places like Tuvalu - are already, in some senses, ghosts. We know the global heating we have built into our atmosphere means these island states will be inundated. It was very important for Ireland to step up to the plate and ensure those ghosts, people in the developing world, were made visible because we owe our place on the UN Security Council to the votes of small island developing states. To keep the Sergio Leone reference going, the loss and damage facility was "A Fistful of Dollars". As it ratchets up, we need to look "For a Few Dollars More", to fit the full trilogy in.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> I will comment briefly on the approach of this House to both today's debate and the debate on climate change. It is not good enough for us in the Green Party to be good at this. We need everybody in this House to upskill and to be better. I would have liked to see members of the Opposition travel to COP 27.</p>

          <p eId="para_702">The tongue will be out. The sheer magnitude of the Government delegation to COP 27 damaged the credibility of the case for climate action. The event has really and truly turned into something akin to a jolly boys' outing to Margate. Figures on the number of delegates have been provided to our colleague, Deputy Nolan, by Departments. There were 11 individuals from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, two from the Department of Finance, ten from the Department of Foreign Affairs, two from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, one from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and two from the Department of Health. That is without mentioning the countless hangers-on from the NGOs, who are dictating policy in this country. They are unelected and are terrorising people around the country. We have been told the Department's delegation cost €12,900, but a spokesperson failed to provide the cost for the group's stay at the five-star beach resort. I hope the Minister had a good time. What was the need to bring such a large delegation? What is that about? From the figures provided in response to this question, we see the cost of travel was more than €50,000. Think of all the gas-guzzling jets. It is a mockery. Imagine anyone seeing this when the Minister is claiming to be the great leader on this. More power to him. I am glad the people over there liked him and had smoked salmon with him. However, the cost fell to the taxpayers here.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The Government used its presence at COP 27 to reiterate its commitment to more than double Ireland's annual international climate finance contribution to €225 million by 2025. That is nice money. What about the people in the cottages who cannot heat their homes? Can they have some of that? Some €18 million of that money was announced by the Minister, Deputy Ryan. It is no bother at all to him to announce how other people's money will be spent. Not to be outdone by the Minister, the Taoiseach was also there announcing the spending of Irish taxpayers' money to garner favour with the COP elites. In the reply to a parliamentary question, he said we are going to spend another €10 million. That is what the Taoiseach coughed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">This is shocking. It is easy to wine and dine and have the big fancy dinners at the expense of the Irish taxpayers, whose tongues are out while trying to live, who cannot put food on the table, who cannot light their fires, and who cannot pay the cost to fill their fuel tanks or anything else. It is a mockery and the backbenchers are there praising it. It will come home to them soon.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_705">With hard times upon us, with energy shortages and blackouts at hand and food shortages in the offing, the climate catastrophe brigade, the political and business elites have once again headed off for a bit of winter sunshine and a talking shop exercise that is now commonly referred to as COP, or the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This year it was the turn of Egypt to wine and dine the assembled hordes. It certainly seems that fine wine flowed freely and posh food was piled high as the hypocritical finger-pointing elites homed their attention in on how the ordinary citizens are going to have to do without.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> The COP meetings have long followed an entirely predictable pattern. Each year hundreds of posturing delegates and thousands of protestors, celebrities, and assorted hangers-on fly in from around the world - 400 private jets, from what I gather, causing untold damage to our climate - to lecture us all on our carbon footprints. They then start up the negotiations and rapidly reach the usual deadlock, before announcing a last-minute breakthrough. Then, in the cold light of day, everybody accepts that nothing has been achieved beyond expanded waistlines and serious hangovers for all the delegates. Exposing Irish taxpayer funds, which are supposed to combat climate change, to the criminal abuse of climate finance is reckless. Based on research carried out by Deloitte and others, it is now clear a substantial proportion of the international climate finance fund is ending up in the bank accounts of dictators and criminals. Therefore, one simple question exists: why would the Taoiseach or the Minister, Deputy Ryan, fly to Egypt to announce to the world that Ireland would dramatically increase its contribution to such a fund? Irish taxpayers deserve to know the answer to this question. The Minister took 55 people with him, as far as I know. Maybe the Minister will deny this. Maybe it was 54 people or whatever. We need to know exactly who they were. The taxpayers are paying for it and we need to know who these people are and where they are from. This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">COP 27 was a meeting of about 137 world leaders, representing 90% of global forest cover, committed to halting and reversing forest loss by 2030. Last week here in the Dáil we saw at first hand the gallop out to COP 27 while the forest farmers in this country are on their knees to keep going. They remain on their knees. There has been no funding here for the forest farmers affected by ash dieback. Forestry would be a quick win for Ireland. The growing of trees can dramatically reduce carbon, yet there is nothing to help farmers to fix the old problem of ash dieback, which the Government could have prevented in 2012 if the Government had told the farmers in the first place that the trees coming in from Holland had the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The Taoiseach has pledged €10 million to the Global Shield initiative and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has pledged €225 million. A total of 28 delegates went from the current Government, plus minders. A reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Carol Nolan showed us 11 individuals went to COP from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, two from the Department of Finance, ten from the Department of Foreign Affairs, two from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, two from the Department of Health, and one from the Department of Agriculture - one. What does the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine look after? He has a responsibility for dairy, forestry and fishing, yet he took only one representative from agriculture. They flew off on their jets and they would probably have been better off sitting here drinking Red Bull, which might have given them wings. That is what they did. They left the foresters behind and they left the ash dieback issue behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Does the Minister, Deputy Ryan, realise that in this country one person dies from hunger every 48 seconds? Yet, the Minister is closing down food production in the State. I ask the Minister to remember that every 48 seconds one person dies from hunger, while the Government is slowing down production here and increasing the amount of food coming into Ireland from other countries. They should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">As I have three minutes and 15 seconds, I will do my best to be focused and not wander off. With regard to this conference, it is 30 years since the United Nations Framework on Climate Change was signed by approximately 154 countries in 1992. This latest conference took place in Egypt where, during the conference, almost 700 people were arrested, according to human rights organisations. Climate activists, NGOs, and the media reported surveillance and intimidation from authorities and, significantly, the number of lobbyists at the summit rose from 133 to 636, when compared with COP 26 in Glasgow. That is according to various recognised organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> What did the Secretary General of the United Nations point out? He said that COP 27 took place not far from Mount Sinai, a site that is central to many faiths through the story of Moses. Although we cannot hope for a miracle here, we need meaningful action. The Secretary General said it was fitting the meeting was near Mount Sinai because climate chaos is a crisis of biblical proportions. The signs are everywhere. Instead of a burning bush we face burning planet. He went on to say that we need to drastically reduce emissions now. Of course, this was something the countries copped out of at COP. The Secretary General welcomed the fund for loss and damage as essential but that it was not the answer. He talked about fundamental change in the way we look at our banks and financial institutions and what we allow them to do. The Secretary General said many more things besides.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> I say my few words today in the context of a summer when 20,000 people died in Europe from heat waves in temperatures that would have been virtually impossible without climate breakdown. We are the lucky ones. All over the world we see that we are at the brink of famine in Africa and other countries, and we have also had floods in Pakistan.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> I mention all of this by saying we can control leadership in a way that does not divide the city from the country. Ireland is a tiny country that should be united in a recognition the planet is burning. Ireland can be green and produce and export. The ESRI has produced a report that is absolutely frightening, telling us our emissions are 70% higher when we consider what we import. As all countries do that are rich, we import to keep consumption going, and the poorer countries lose out. In Galway, for example, we persist with ridiculous outer bypass roads and roads that are going nowhere, when there is a golden opportunity to look at light rail and sustainable transport. We must take it away from management who are not showing vision, and lead the way.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_714">The Swedish eco-activist Greta Thunberg famously described COP 26 as a load of "blah, blah, blah". She went a bit further with COP 27 describing it as a sham that provides a platform for "greenwashing, lying and cheating". There is also plenty of blah at COP 27, and none better than from our Taoiseach. If you were to believe the Taoiseach, you would think Ireland is leading the world in addressing climate change. The reality, however, is very different. While Ireland may have very ambitious emissions reduction targets, we are nowhere near to meeting them. Ireland has the third highest emissions <i>per capita</i> in the EU. The official statistics do not give the full picture. As said by my colleague, the ESRI report says our greenhouse gas emissions are up to 70% higher than calculated. This is when we take into account what we actually consume, as opposed to producing. We have bought very high levels of emissions from countries that produce chemicals, rubber, plastics and so on. When it comes to carbon impact, of the high-tech products we import, we import 55 times more than we produce but it is the emissions that are embedded in imports for households that make up the imported emissions. This is because under existing international rules to combat climate change, a country's emissions are based on what it produces. This allows richer countries, in effect, to export their emissions to poorer countries in the global south. This penalises those countries who are involved in a more carbon-heavy stage of the global supply chain. It is an extreme example of greenwashing and the hypocrisy of events such as COP.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> COP 27 was sponsored by Coca-Cola, which says a lot, and was supposed to be the African COP but the Africans and those suffering the worst of climate breakdown to date were not the key players in this event. As usual, the biggest group were the lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry. According to one NGO, there were at least 636 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry. This figure was greater than the combined delegates from the ten most climate-impacted countries. The United Arab Emirates had the biggest delegation with more than 1,000. The UAE has a population of just nine million but is a major oil and gas exporter. Oil and gas lobbyists were included in 29 national delegations. These figures give a very clear indication as to who has the real say at these gatherings.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> It was no surprise, then, that several commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow, such as the target for global emissions to peak by 2025, rather than being reinforced, were actually dropped from the final text. There was no mention of fossil fuels and hardly any mention of the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Next year's COP will be held in Dublin - enough said.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Climate breakdown does not affect just the future; it is happening now, with calamitous effects on those countries and communities least responsible for it. We are in a catastrophic situation now, with global warming at 1.2°C, and we are heading for double that within decades. Large parts of the planet will become uninhabitable. This is inevitable unless we bring to an end the social and economic system based on the needs of major multinationals, the fossil fuel investors and the 1% and replace it with a democratic planned economy based on the needs of people and their environment. We need climate transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> I congratulate the Civil Service on getting the loss and damage package but, as Clare Connor of Friends of the Earth said, the gain in loss and damage is undermined by the failure of COP27 to phase out fossil fuels.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Eamon Ryan)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_720">I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate. I will start by reflecting some of the stories that were told at COP about the climate change happening in the world this year. It was heartrending to listen to the Pakistani Minister for the environment make the case that her country was destroyed this year and is still suffering from the scale of that damage, with some 35 million people displaced. Interestingly, she said that every single person in Pakistan is now fixated on what is happening to their climate because they have seen what it has done to their country. I was very privileged to meet a number of ministers and young people from different countries, including ministers from some of the low-lying islands in the Pacific that Deputy Ó Cathasaigh mentioned. They described their experience of the water they draw from their wells now becoming brackish. It is not just that the sea level is rising and threatening their shore; it is coming up through their water system. They know and understand that their time on their islands may be short. With passion and commitment they had to try to raise the alarm in the world about this need for change.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> We have known about this for 30 years plus but it has now reached a stage where we have to act. There are the farmers and families in the likes of the Horn of Africa who have seen five years of drought one year after the other. Their need for a response was centre stage at COP27, as it has been at previous COPs. I believe there was significant development to give some sense of hope in this world which is burning in the decision made by 198 countries to establish a mosaic of loss and damage funding mechanisms to help cover some of the cost of the damage that we already know is inevitable and that is already being done. I will reflect briefly on what was agreed at the conference and on some of the detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> First, and perhaps most importantly, there was a response to the call from the Prime Minister of Barbados at the start of the COP that the injustice of the current finance system needs to be addressed and that the World Bank, the IMF and the multilateral development banks have a critical role and responsibility. I cannot remember who here asked what we have agreed to and if we have agreed only that the parties will meet in March. That is significant, however, because it is a political mandate and a political signal and a really powerful message that the parties have to change their ways and change the access to special drawing rights, which would allow the poorest countries in the world access to finance where they need it most. It will change the debt rules and the mechanisms for them to raise finance, which they cannot do today. As the Prime Minister of Barbados said, they have to borrow at 14% while we borrow at 4%. It is therefore not insignificant when the world comes together and collectively agrees to change the rules and to change the way those multilateral development banks work.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Second, and this was hard-fought and not easily agreed, in the final text, the final wording, there is clearly an agreement that we will expand and broaden the base of countries that may contribute to such a loss and damage fund to include the likes of China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries that can no longer be categorised as developing-world, just like some of those small island developing countries and less developed countries. While that is not certain or finalised in full detail, I believe there was significant progress and change in getting the agreement on the loss and damage fund to recognise that it has to be broader.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> The European Union had a really significant role throughout the last week of negotiations in COP in reflecting that other industries have to play their part. The fossil fuel lobbyists did not have their way in COP because there was clear commitment from the European Union especially towards new innovative forms of financing, as they were described, to recognise the $3.9 trillion in net income earned by the fossil fuel industries this year. A percentage of that could and should go towards covering some of the damage that has been done. In the aviation industry, as Mary Robinson said at an event I shared with her, 4.5 billion airline tickets are sold every year. A €1 contribution per ticket in the aviation sector would give us the scale of funding we will need to provide climate justice in our world. While none of that is finally nailed down, there is really a clear commitment, agreement and political mandate that that is where we are going and that is why that was significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> The European Union had a very significant role in the negotiations because in the middle of the week we listened to what the other countries, particularly some of the poorer countries in the world, were saying. Our position was not that one fund, certainly not one based on the old 1992 rulebook, would be the appropriate outcome we needed, but we listened to and heard their political need for a clear signal and commitment. On Wednesday of that week we changed our position and said, let us talk about the fund now and the nature of the financing mechanisms. Then, later in the week, when the detail of what would be put in place was shown to us towards the latter days, it was not adequate. As a Union, we collectively said a bad deal is not worth it and we would better have no deal. We said that clearly on the last morning, Saturday morning, and said we would not be able to get agreement on the basis of the text that was before us. That morning and afternoon it changed and we got the text improved. To answer the question as to why would we send Irish civil servants to such an event, it is because they were the very centre of the global negotiations at a moment of critical importance. It was Irish civil servants who were critically responsible for the improvements in that text of a major historic international global agreement.</p>

It was Irish civil servants and our negotiating team that put that back into the centre of the negotiations, recognising that the existing tranche of climate finance does not go to the poorest, by and large. The vast majority goes elsewhere. We stood up because we as a country have always stood up for the poorest countries in this world.</p>

We have delivered a completely new forestry programme that will be good for rural Ireland, good for the countryside as well as good for climate. On Monday, we delivered the first of the new deposit return schemes so there is less plastic and less recycling. We delivered, this morning, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire said with DART carriages for Cork.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_769">condemns:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_770">— the failure of the Government, in particular the Minister for Transport, Eamonn Ryan TD, and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath TD, to respond and include the necessary financial provisions in Budget 2023, and to offset these planned increases and lessen the burden on workers, families, and businesses in the midst of the cost-of-living and fuel crisis; and </p>

          <p eId="para_773">I note the Government's eleventh-hour intervention where it has decided to defer the road toll increases for six months. It is clear as day that the Government has been bounced into this decision as a direct result of political and, probably more importantly, public pressure. There has been a huge public response to this crazy proposal. The Department of Transport was notified of these toll increases three full months ago, on 1 September, yet it took until today to get any action from the Government, just hours before this Sinn Féin motion calling on the toll increases to be stopped. As early as this morning it was being reported that a decision would not be made until closer to the new year. It is a welcome action but it does not go far enough. </p>
          <p eId="para_774"> The Government's announcement does not solve the problem. It only serves to kick the can down the road and it fails to provide the certainty required by families. It does not address the underlying problems. There seems to be no recognition whatever that we are living in a crippling cost-of-living crisis. Workers, hauliers and businesses are really struggling with transport costs. It is now proposed that the tolls will increase instead next summer, at a time when petrol and diesel prices have gone back up due to the expiration of the excise relief and just before the Government hikes fuel prices yet again with its annual carbon tax increase. This proposed toll increase will add €8 million to the operating costs of hauliers in the second half of 2023. It will heap additional costs on workers and families who have no alternatives. </p>
          <p eId="para_775"> In recent days I have been contacted by hauliers who are put to the pin of their collars. They have real concerns that their businesses will go to the wall. I have been contacted by people who have to travel for dialysis six times a week on a disability payment. The increasing cost of petrol and diesel and the obligation to make the commute through the tolls is putting them under severe financial pressure. It is completely unacceptable that the Government would let this situation get to this point. </p>
          <p eId="para_776"> The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan buried his head in the sand on this and simply hoped it would go away. He can show interest in toll roads an has in the past when it suited him. In opposition he called for electric vehicle, EV, owners to pay no tolls at all but when it comes to ordinary motorists, commercial operators or people driving a white van or a lorry who cannot afford an EV or do not have an EV option, he has no interest at all. This entire saga highlights how generous these gold-plated Fianna Fáil-era road toll contracts are and further, how poorly successive Governments since have invested in roads maintenance and upkeep. The public private partnership, PPP, contracts seem to be a win, win, win for the private contractor. The M3 operator made €11 million profit last year. That company gets paid millions if not enough cars use the road. Its tolls go up with inflation and the State is locked into these contracts for decades. It is a cash cow. </p>
          <p eId="para_777"> Earlier, I read a 2010 article in<i> The Irish Times, </i>which highlighted that the Government did not know how much the company behind the M50 project had originally invested in the project before agreeing to a deal which would ensure that this private company received a €1.15 billion return on investment. You could not make it up. It is expected that the private company partnered in the Limerick tunnel project will receive payment of €200 million over the lifetime of the project due to lower than expected traffic volumes. These toll contracts are a relic of the Fianna Fáil cowboy era of poor planning and financial incompetence. Motorists are still paying the price for this. Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is to tell the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications this evening that the M50 and Port tunnel raised €200 million annually for it and that it uses that money to maintain the national road network. It says that just €400 million is provided by the Department which is 2% of asset value. That is nowhere near what is needed. M50 motorists are paying for the upkeep of roads across this country because the Government has failed to put a proper sustainable plan in place. That is what it needs to do over the next six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_778">I will focus on public private partnerships on large public infrastructure projects. PPPs have frequently been used for large infrastructure and in social housing, healthcare and education. Today they represent a €11 billion liability for the State. The PPP model of delivery often promised that it would bring great benefits, including better value for money, accessing private finance, greater efficiency from private sector management and risk transfer whereby risk from delays and cost overruns transfer to the private investor. However, these supposed benefits often simply do not materialise. Not only that but the additional costs are often left with the public. This experience has mirrored the disappointing results elsewhere. As a result, PPPs have attracted a bad reputation. A 2018 study by the European Court of Auditors found that PPPs frequently produce considerable delays and major cost increases and had weak transparency. Research by economists Dr. Eoin Reeves and Dr. Donal Palcic, by housing expert Dr. Rory Hearne, by the former chief economist in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Paul Sweeney and by the Comptroller and Auditor General have had similar findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> We often see aggressive tax avoidance through the use of special purpose vehicles, SPVs, and holding company structures and creative accounting. I will give a concrete example, namely, the PPP for the M4 motorway. In 2014, the company that carried out the work changed how its turnover was reported. It went from measuring turnover on the basis of toll revenue and other payments to a profit margin on operating costs incurred for the year and a return on the financial asset of the company based on future cash flow projection. In one fell swoop, this reduced its reported turnover from €29.5 million to €21.2 million and more than halved its corporate tax bill. Nevertheless, PPPs remain a part of the national development plan and a key part of Housing for All. Those are the major concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> The Minister of State and I are in the same constituency and we often have to go through those tolls. I heard the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan say at the weekend that 10 cent is not a lot of money but when we see all the bills rising, 10 cent then is considerable. </p>

          <p eId="para_781">I welcome the news that the toll increase across the PPP roads and the M50 will be deferred until July 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">However, this does not go far enough. Workers and families across the State are in a cost-of-living crisis and the Government's only solution is to kick the can down the road until July. The Minister for Transport was notified in early September, prior to the budget, of these price hikes and decided to do nothing about them. Now, following the Sinn Féin motion to scrap the toll increase and under public pressure, the Government has changed its position. The entire saga highlights the risk to the taxpayer of public-private partnerships and how the financial recklessness of the past Fianna Fáil Governments is coming back to trouble us again.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Due to the lack of alternative public transport options, commuters in Laois and Offaly often rely on private cars and regularly use the M1, M4, M7 and M50 toll roads on their journeys to and from work etc. The toll increases will place further financial pressure on workers and families, who already face very high petrol and diesel costs in a cost-of-living crisis. It will also hit the haulage sector very hard. Hauliers have raised this with me. The proposals will see toll charges on the M4, M7 and M1 increase to €2.10 and on the M50 to a whopping €3.50. Therefore, people in south Laois travelling on a return journey of roughly 85 miles to just north of Drogheda will have to pay six tolls, costing €15.40 per day. That is a heavy price to pay. I have experienced it. It is all right for me but people on low wages must experience it. It is a genuine problem for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> These toll increases follow a similar price hike last January. In Sinn Féin's alternative budget – we do put forward alternatives – we outlined that savings of €25.6 million could have been achieved by reducing the electric car grant cut-off point from €60,000 to €50,000. In other words, only electric cars valued up to €50,000 would be subsidised. That would yield over €25 million. Savings of €18 million would accrue from taxing private jets. These options are still available to the Government. Our proposal mandates the Government not to go ahead with the price hikes at all, either in January or July.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The Government's eleventh-hour announcement is welcome but, let us be honest, it was forced to act. It had absolutely no intention of making the announcement in the absence of a public backlash and political pressure. This whole farce comes from the absolutely ridiculous contracts entered into by Fianna Fáil years ago. I have been raising this issue here since I was elected in 2016 because Drogheda is the only town in Ireland with tolled slip roads. These have had a detrimental effect on the town. You have to pay a toll to get from one side of the town to the other, or from a retail park on one side of the town to the other side. If you do not pay it, you spend 40 minutes in traffic because lorries, HGVs and vans all drive through the town to avoid tolls. I have long campaigned for the removal of the slip road toll, but successive Governments have done nothing about it to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> It is clear from the responses I have received over the years that the protection of the profits of the private companies is the Government's main priority. It would not even consider lifting the toll on the slip-roads during the Fleadh Cheoil in Drogheda because it would have meant compensating the companies for their loss of profit, as per their contracts. Working people do not get to demand pay increases due to inflation but the Government has ensured the companies that operate the tolls can do just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Celtic Roads Group operates the M1 between Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballymascanlon, County Louth. In 2021, a year of Covid-related travel restrictions, the group reported a pre-tax profit of €8.14 million on the toll. Some 12 million vehicles passed through the plaza at Julianstown last year. Celtic Roads Group paid out dividends of €9.25 million to its shareholders last year. Its shareholders are the Semperian group, a Britain-based asset-management business; DIF Capital Partners, an infrastructure equity fund manager based in the Netherlands; Royal BAM Group, which is based in the Netherlands, and PGGM, which manages Dutch occupational pension funds. Celtic Roads and its shareholders are clearly not suffering financial hardship, which is more than can be said for many of those who pass through the toll plaza every year. All we are asking for is that the Government stop the latest gouging of ordinary working people and not just kick the can. It should give certainty to people.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for tabling this motion to stop the hike in toll charges on our motorways. Sometimes I believe the Government is living under a rock when it comes to the cost-of-living crisis. The crisis is real. It is real for the people of my constituency, who are making a stark choice between eating and heating. The cost-of-living crisis is real for the many who will be struggling this Christmas. While I am glad that the Government crawled out from underneath its rock, caved in to the political and public pressure and announced the deferral of toll charges for six months, this does not go far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> The excuse that the increases are in line with inflation simply does not wash. Ordinary workers and families have not seen their wages rise with inflation. On the M50 alone, tolls of €140 million were collected in 2021. </p>
          <p eId="para_790">People who drive to work or drive for a living are already affected by increases in the prices of petrol and diesel. To impose further increases on them was just unfair. I want to know who is in the driving seat. Is it the Department of Transport, the Minister, the National Transport Authority, NTA, or TII? Is the Minister simply asleep at the wheel?</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Workers in Liffey Valley have been adversely impacted by recommendations of the NTA and TII on the introduction of car parking charges for workers. I have supported the workers, who have been on strike 16 October. Information I received from South Dublin County Council stated paid parking was a condition-of-planning requirement for the redevelopment of the car park in Liffey Valley. This condition was strongly recommended by both the NTA and TII during the planning process. In the same correspondence, South Dublin County Council states sustainable travel policies are aligned with those of the NTA and TII and that it therefore supports the "reasonable" travel costs, which entail the introduction of paid parking at Liffey Valley. While the imposition of car parking charges on workers by a vulture fund is reprehensible, Government policies have allowed it to happen. We need a change of policy; we need a change of Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_792">I welcome the fact that the Government was forced into a U-turn on the proposed introduction of the charges. The charges have been deferred for six months but should be scrapped completely as there is no justification for them. The cost-of-living crisis is still with us and will be with us in June 2023. People from all walks of life are feeling the pinch. If it is not a case of extortionately high rents and food costs, it is a case of high electricity and gas costs, an increase in petrol prices and a battle against inflation. In the midst of the hardship people are experiencing, the Government wants to increase the cost of road tolls.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> It has been suggested that the price hike is to ensure road maintenance but it is evident that it is more about allowing the operators' profits to keep pace with inflation. The Tánaiste suggested these are the first price increases in nine years. They are not. In Limerick, the Limerick tunnel has been tolled. The price increased in the past 12 months, from €1.90 to €2. Even if people decided <i>en masse</i> not to use the tunnel, the operator would still get paid through the traffic guarantee clauses. These ensure the taxpayers pay if an agreed-upon number of vehicles do not use the road. For Limerick Tunnel, the baseline is 17,000 vehicles per day. In 2021, taxpayers paid €8.4 million to the operator because of the clauses. From June 2019 to June 2020, the taxpayers paid €7 million. As my colleague Deputy O'Rourke said, over the lifetime of the tunnel, we will pay €200 million approximately in taxpayers' money to the operator. Each way, the taxpayer and consumer will lose. When Limerick tunnel was built, the State was awash with money, so the Fianna Fáil Government committed to giving it away through cowboy deals with road tunnel operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> Tolling the Limerick tunnel or the M3 never made sense. Taxpayers are left to foot the bill when these roads are underused. The Government actually wants people in Limerick and Clare to pay even more to use a route that already has underlying problems. When the Limerick tunnel was first proposed, I pointed out that it had fundamental flaws, as experts said. The main flaw was that it was far too close to the city to be tolled in such a way as to have the desired effect on city traffic. </p>
          <p eId="para_795"> In Limerick city, one of the main traffic congestion points is Shannon Bridge on Dock Road. More than 15,000 cars use that route daily. The alternative is to use the Limerick tunnel. For years now, people have avoided this option as they do not want to pay the toll on their daily commute. This was predicted. The Limerick tunnel was built too close to the city centre and its charge is too high for it to reach its maximum potential and remove traffic from the streets of Limerick.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">The message is loud and clear: pressure works. The Government responds to pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">As usual, <i>lastminute.com</i> is the order of the day with the Government. It has responded and, as expected and predicted, its response is wholly inadequate. Nonetheless, the travelling public know it felt their anger.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> I commend my colleague, an Teachta O'Rourke, on all of his work on this. I also commend the travelling public on making sure their voice has been heard on this matter. We need to be very clear. Those people who have no alternative but to use roads and pay tolls will not be placated by the Government kicking the can down the road. Next summer there will still be a cost-of-living crisis for commuters. Those people who are scratching out a living and driving all day will still experience a cost-of-doing-business crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> There is no crisis for the toll companies. As an Teachta O'Rourke highlighted eloquently, they seem to be doing very well for themselves. It seems perhaps that is all that matters to the Government. Why would they not do well? They are benefiting from a good, old-fashioned Fianna Fáil deal. We know those deals are rarely good for ordinary people or small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Kicking the can down the road serves to fool absolutely nobody. People see that the Government will respond to pressure and next July, when it tries this again, there will be the same amount of pressure. I am not sure the Government understands the situation when members of the Government say that a 10 cent increase is not a lot of money. However, when people have no choice but to use toll roads a couple of times a day or week, that is significant and it all adds up. The dismissive attitude to people who are struggling is quite the signature attitude of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> It will feel people's anger because the people who are struggling today will still be struggling next July. We see who's side the Government is on. The Government has said these companies have to have cost of living increases that match inflation. The 80 cent increase in the minimum wage does not match inflation. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures show that wages are not rising at the rate of inflation, yet the Government wants to protect very well off companies.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_802">I thank Deputies for the opportunity to speak to the House about the increase in toll prices on a number of national roads. I can confirm that the Government is not opposing the motion. However, while the overall objective of the motion is in line with the Government's concern around the increase in the cost of living and its effect on workers, families and businesses, there were some assertions made in the motion which require clarification and will be highlighted in the ministerial speeches this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> There are 11 toll roads in the State, of which ten are on the national road network. The East Link-Ringsend bridge toll in Dublin is on the local road network. Of the ten tolls on the national road network, two are essentially public tolls, namely the M50 and the Dublin tunnel. Revenue from these tolls is collected directly for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, by operating companies under contract to Tll. These revenues are invested by Tll in the operation and maintenance of the road network. It is important to point out that toll income is not allocated to the construction of new roads, but rather to the protection and renewal of the existing network.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> It should also be noted that there are extra inflationary costs in the construction industry, particularly in regard to products such as bitumen which is used in road pavement repair, meaning the cost of the protection and renewal of the existing network has increased significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The other eight roads are public private partnership, PPP, roads which were constructed and are now operated and maintained under long-term contracts with Tll. Revenue generated by these roads is collected by the PPP company and used to repay loans arising from the construction of the road and to fund ongoing operations and maintenance activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The public, private and contract law considerations with respect to increasing toll charges for public toll roads and PPP toll roads are somewhat different. In addition, there are different financial and budgetary implications relating to toll revenue generated, with TII more reliant on the public toll revenues.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> In terms of the framework for setting tolls, toll by-laws for each individual road set out the basis for calculating maximum tolls each year. Maximum tolls are calculated for each vehicle category. Tll calculates the maximum tolls for the Dublin tunnel and the M50 and decides the actual tolls that should apply. The PPP companies calculate the maximum tolls for the eight PPP concession schemes and propose the actual tolls that should apply. The mechanism for these calculations is set out in the individual toll by-law and is based on the consumer price index, CPI. Actual tolls charged may not exceed the calculated maximum toll for each scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> In December 2021, Tll announced an increase in toll charges for eight toll roads for 2022. It should be noted this was the first increase in tolls for motor cars since 2013. This increase was driven by inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> For 2023, the board of Tll has approved a number of toll changes. In the case of public tolls, there is no change to existing toll rates for the Dublin tunnel, while the toll rates for the M50 have increased across the board. Increases have also been agreed for all eight PPP schemes. These increases include a 30 cent increase for cars without tags or video accounts on the M50, bringing the toll paid to €3.50. On the M4, there will be an increase of 20 cent for cars which brings the toll to €3.20. Tolls on the other PPP schemes will increase by 10 cent. This has been driven by inflation of 8.6%, based on the CPI, and is within the relevant by-laws for each scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_810"> It is estimated that these changes will generate approximately €25 million in additional toll revenue, dependent on traffic volume, which will be used for loan repayments in the case of the PPP schemes and maintenance and operations in the schemes in question, and to ensure that toll income continues to support adequately the protection and renewal of the existing road network. Any measures introduced in regard to these toll increases will need to account for the contractual arrangements with the PPP companies, along with the impact on the protection and renewal of the existing road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> PPPs have been instrumental in the expansion of Ireland's motorway network through recent decades, particularly on inter-urban routes. This has delivered safer roads with reduced journey times to the benefit of private motorists, businesses and the haulage sector. Furthermore, the contractual arrangements for these roads ensure they will be maintained in a safe and robust condition before reverting to the State on the ending of the contract. These arrangements have allowed for risk-sharing, efficient project management and delivery and the completion of critical public infrastructure without incurring upfront Exchequer costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The motion put forward refers to payments to PPP operators. I would like to expand on this. These variable operation payments, VOPs, cover two PPP toll concession contracts, namely the M3 Clonee to Kells and N18 Limerick tunnel. They provide that where traffic volumes do not reach a threshold specified in the respective contract, moneys are paid from the State to the toll operator. This has incentivised private sector infrastructure development on roads where traffic volumes are less certain.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Due to Covid-19 restrictions there was a significant drop off in traffic levels across the national road network in 2020-21, including the two VOP contract roads I mentioned. As a result, VOP payments in 2020 and 2021 increased on 2019. In addition to the reduction in traffic due to Covid-19, the other factors that impacted the calculation of VOPs in 2020 and 2021 included the level of traffic guarantee applicable to each year, the level of toll charges applicable to each year and the level of non-availability payments, which are deductions for lane closures, applicable to each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> Covid-19 and the reduced traffic since 2019, combined with the reduced VAT on toll charges in 2020 and 2021, contributed significantly to the increase in 2020 and 2021 payments. It should also be pointed out that as part of a revenue sharing mechanism contained in PPP contracts that if traffic volumes exceed a certain threshold specified in the contract for each scheme, the excess toll revenue returns from the toll operator to the State. In recent years, such revenue has been generated on the M4 and M1.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> The Department has introduced a number of public transport measures to help to ease the cost of transport, mainly aimed at reducing fares for users.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Furthermore, the Department has rolled out an emergency support scheme for hauliers. There have also been other Government measures, such as the reduction on excise duty for petrol and diesel. This is in addition to the various measures outlined in budget 2023 to help people with the challenges relating to the cost of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> The broad intent of this motion is generally in line with the principles of the Government in helping people as the cost of living increases. I can confirm that the Department of Transport has been directed to develop options that might allow for the suspension of planned toll increases until the end of June 2023. As I have outlined, however, the toll contracts are complicated and further discussions with all relevant parties, including TII, are needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">It has been stated by some of my colleagues already that the problem is that we are starting from a bad place in that these PPPs have not delivered for the people, although they have delivered for the companies. Like everyone else here, I welcome the fact that we have a mitigation and that we have delayed the toll increases until June 2023. We were dealing with a huge amount of people who were making contact with us. As Deputy O'Rourke said, you are dealing with people who are paying multiple tolls each day as they travel for necessary dialysis and many other medical procedures. We are aware that haulage companies are under severe pressure. Medium-sized hauliers that are looking at dealing with three or four tolls, are talking about toll costs of between €100,000 and €130,000. These would be going up by €20,000 to €30,000, which is significant money. The idea of tolls was to free up traffic and to pay for maintenance. When we were first told about tolls, such as those relating to the East Link Bridge and the West-Link Bridge - before them we had the arrival of the M50 - the idea was that these would be short-term fixes for the projects to pay for themselves. That has changed and as has been said, the difficulty is that these PPPs did not deliver for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> We can all talk about individual tolls, and I will talk about the M1. Deputy Munster spoke about the difficulty with the slip road in Drogheda, the huge cost that has and the impact it has on Drogheda. At this stage, because of the cost of tolls, we are dealing with a huge number of hauliers and others who are going through the towns that were meant to be bypassed. Again, we have not put together a sustainable means of delivering road maintenance. We all know that the people who are putting money into the M50 are paying for a considerable amount of road maintenance outside of the M50. I will return to the M1 and I will repeat the figure of €8.1 million, which are last year's pre-tax profits for the Celtic Roads Group for the M1. That is phenomenal money and we need a better and more sustainable solution. I could go on but my time is up.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">People are sick to the teeth of this Government hiking prices left, right and centre. Ordinary people are sick of being at the bottom of the pile time and again. Once again this Government is trying to sneak through measures that will put even more pressure on the pockets of ordinary people. We are talking about a counterbalance to Dublin in Cork but the reality is that without public transport we need connectivity. People coming from outside of Cork have no way to access Dublin and no main roads unless they are going through tolls. The only other way to travel from Cork city is to get the train. The fares for doing so are expensive. I will give the Minister of State an idea of those fares. This weekend, if two people want to travel to Dublin from Cork, it will cost over €100. That is to sit in the train with no refreshments because they have been suspended since the time of Covid. A lot of people do not have the money to pay for the train. People are struggling to put petrol and diesel in their cars and now this Government is putting tolls up on top of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> We hear a lot of talk about the need for the carrot-and-stick approach. If you are a developer, a land hoarder or someone sitting on derelict sites there are loads of carrots but little stick. There is a reward all the time for the friends of the Government but for ordinary people looking to travel around the State there are only sticks. The Government is punishing ordinary people again, when their bills have gone up and when people cannot afford to put diesel or petrol in their cars. At what stage will the Government say that enough is enough for ordinary people. These are people who are in the eye of a cost-of-living storm and this is what the Government is doing. The increase will only add to inflation. People will have to pay more to travel and haulage companies and businesses are all affected. However, once again, the private companies and their profits continue to rise.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">Toll roads and the toll bridges over the River Liffey operate as virtual monopolies. As councils impose restrictions on access to alternative routes or to roads adjacent to toll roads, it is more likely that the individual driver will be diverted, by design, to the toll road. The price increases do not appear substantial but they soon mount up as drivers make multiple trips over the course of a week, month or year. Price increases are happening across the board with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Drivers are struggling to pay for fuel and these increases will hit already hard-hit motorists. For M50 tolls, the cost is due to increase by between 20 cent and 30 cent, depending on what method of payment you use. Those who have a tag on their cars will see the toll costs rise from €2.10 to €2.30. The cost of a toll on unregistered cars will increase by 30 cent, from €3.20 to €3.50, and the tolls for goods vehicles using the M50 will see a price rise of 20 cent or 60 cent per journey, depending on the size of the vehicle and the method of payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> I would also like the Minister of State to look at the penalties that are imposed on drivers who, for whatever reason, miss a payment on a toll. These penalties rapidly escalate to exorbitant amounts being owed to the toll companies. The eight toll roads operated by PPP companies will see toll costs increase to the maximum level. For example, the cost of a toll for a car using the M4 motorway will increase from €3 to €3.20. The other seven toll roads will see a price increase of 10 cent more. People need their cars to get to work and in Dublin people definitely need them to get to industrial estates in the north and south of the city. Public transport will simply not work if you are travelling from the north side to an industrial complex on the south side and anyone who lives in Dublin knows this. People are dependent on their cars to get to work, therefore, and their pay packets decrease with every price increase. This toll increase in unnecessary and impractical; it is detrimental to the economic good of the city.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">With breaking news this afternoon on their deferral, it seems the bells have tolled on the toll increases, at least for now. On behalf of my constituents in Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth, Kilcock, Donadea, Broadford and out along the M4, I would like to thank an Teachta O'Rourke for the political pressure this motion has brought to bear. It is no harm to remind the public what this was all about. Just last week the Government was pretending that the toll increases were a surprise to them but we found out subsequently that it had known since September. The Tánaiste told the Dáil last week that there had not been an increase in tolls in nine years, when they had already gone up in January. As a result, there can be no room for surprised faces in respect of this matter. These new hikes were not being levied to make the roads better; they were being levied to make better and bigger profits for private companies because road transport, like all the other essential and supposedly public aspects of life like the buses, healthcare, childcare and elder care, has been engineered to become a vehicle for private profit. It is perverse, when we are trying to cut down road transport for the sake of climate, that some toll roads have guaranteed traffic clauses. This means that means citizens' money has to be used to step in and pick up the tab when traffic is not deemed to be enough for these private company profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> An Teachta O'Rourke mentioned the €8.4 million of taxpayer's hard-earned money that went to the Limerick tunnel operator in 2021 and the M3 operator that got €3 million for there not being enough traffic in 2020 when the pandemic was at its height.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">While the wages will not go up in line with inflation, the profits of the private toll operators do. Why? Because, as an Teachta Farrell has already outlined, the PPP contracts allow them to do that. We have huge concerns about them. It is nice work if you can get it, when the Government is so generous with private companies on the public's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> We want the hikes to take a hike, because it is the commuter who cannot depend on the bus to get to work who is paying. It is the parent who was promised a free place for their child to get to school but found out there was no place at all. It is the worker paying through the nose already for petrol and diesel and car insurance who will take the hit. Right now, toll increases are deferred, which is good, because people are punch-drunk from paying out big money for the very basics, not just getting on.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">I welcome the announcement of a six-month delay, but we understand the money is still going to have to be paid. The sum of €12.5 million will have to come from somewhere else to be paid to these eight PPP companies in order for the State to meet its contractual obligations. What has emerged from this is a worrying proposition, in terms of how we as a State, as the owner of the road networks, is running them and raising revenue. People accept tolls as a fact of life, but with these projected toll increases the level of anger was quite astonishing, because people are so put to the pin of their collar. I spoke about this during my Topical Issue debate last Thursday week. There was a huge reaction to this announcement. There is a straw that broke the camel's back element to it. The vast majority of people who use tolls drive on motorways because they are travelling long distances and they cannot get public transport. It is the network that was designed for long-distance travel in a relatively quick and efficient way by car, truck or other vehicle. I gave the example of workers from Swords who have to go to Ballymount and the proposed increases would have been more than €100 a month travelling on the M50 every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> The tolls are frozen, but they will go up. Peter Walsh from Transport Infrastructure Ireland is currently before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. His opening statement lays bare the situation. The vast majority of committee members probably were not aware of the situation regarding the contract and just how long the contracts with PPP companies are. Six of them are for 30 years, one is for 35 years, and the other is for 45 years. I will knit that with what Mr. Walsh says about the impact of freezing toll charges.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_832">In the event that a freezing of toll charges is agreed, [which it now has been for six months] the contractual entitlement to the index linking of toll charges would still exist. If inflation continues to rise, this will result in rebalancing of, and consequentially, larger increases to, toll charges in January 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">That is incredibly worrying and concerning. The mistaken belief is that this cost-of-living crisis is seasonal and that we will reach March or April 2023, things will all be brighter, and the cost of living and inflation will go down. We all understand that is a fallacy. Where are we going with these toll contracts in this country? Are they just going to rise exponentially in line with the consumer price index, CPI? What is the long-term future for people who must travel, work and haul by the motorway system? Are we getting value for money from the contracts with these companies? I would argue we are not. The M50 has raised €1.2 billion in the past ten years, and it was €124 million in 2021, when we had restricted economic activity due to the Covid pandemic. Tolls are significant revenue raisers. We know money gets pumped back into the system. Some €200 million annually from the two public tolls goes back in and then there is revenue share from the PPP toll concessions. We do not know how much the revenue share is. I do not have those figures to hand, but it is something I will endeavour to find out. Is this the right model for Ireland in this decade, the next decade and future decades?</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> I was very disturbed to hear the comments on this from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, responded on the day in the media and she read out a script in reply to the Topical Issue matter. That day also, the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, referred to it on Leaders' Questions. The Minister of State and the Tánaiste were surprised by this, as if the increase had come as a bolt from the blue and that it was purely due to inflation, whereas the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said we need revenue to target congestion and to meet our climate targets. That is not why these increases were put forward. These are not a congestion charge or a climate charge. If we want to change the goalposts on this revenue and to ring-fence it for those measures, then the Minister must say so, but that is not the reason. It was disingenuous of the senior Minister to say that in this regard. He was the only person in political life who seemed to welcome the increase, as if it was great and that commuters would absorb it. They are unable to absorb much more. The Government has acknowledged that in terms of the freeze, but as Mr. Walsh's contribution to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications a short time ago illustrates, we are storing up increases into 2024 and beyond. There will have to be a serious conversation, perhaps through the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and within the Government, on whether we are getting value for money and if this is the right model or if we will face perpetual increases year on year and decade on decade?</p>

          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_835">I have a straightforward question for the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and her Government colleagues. When the Celtic Roads Group contract for the M1 motorway and the toll in and out of Drogheda town is up - it ends in 2034 - will the Government commit to dropping the toll entirely? The word from successive administrations has been ambiguous, quite frankly. I received replies from one of the Minister of State's predecessors, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Ross, in 2018, in which he suggested to me that when the Celtic Roads Group contract was up and the infrastructure reverted to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and TII, it was open for consideration that the State would continue to operate the toll. That would be the ultimate kick in the teeth for the people in villages like Julianstown and my home town of Drogheda. We had two tolls imposed on us by the Fianna Fáil Party in the early 2000s. In my view, that was a political act. The Drogheda and east Meath areas were a testing bed for the introduction of tolls into towns in this country. We are living with the very serious health, social, economic and environmental consequences for the people of Drogheda and Julianstown. Significant amounts of the traffic go through Drogheda town every single day. The small village of Julianstown has a population of 700 to 800 people and, due to toll avoidance, has 22,000 traffic movements every day. HGVs, cars, vans and all kinds of vehicles go via Julianstown into Drogheda every day to avoid the toll that was imposed on the people of Drogheda, south Louth and east Meath by a Fianna Fáil-led Government in the early 2000s. I want the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to be clear with us, because there is a degree of ambiguity. What will happen to the toll going in and out of the town of Drogheda in 2034 when the road reverts to the Department? We need clarity on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> I posed the question to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, last week and the response was interesting. Rather than answer the question, which is a policy matter for the Department of Transport, he referred it to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, based on his view that this was an operational matter. It is not an operational matter. This is a matter of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I challenge the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to drive through the town of Drogheda or the village of Julianstown. Back in 2018, it was recommended that Julianstown be placed on the capital programme for a bypass to protect the health and safety of its people. All we have now is a grant for less than €3 million for Meath County Council, through the Department of Transport, and from some of its own resources, to develop safety measures in the village. That will not reduce the traffic by one iota.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">It may reduce the risk to the lives of the people of Julianstown but it will not save them because there are serious health implications given the congestion and the environmental damage being caused to the area. The Baymore area of south Drogheda is being crucified with heavy goods vehicles leaving the cement factory in Platin and the municipal waste incinerator in Carranstown, County Meath, avoiding the toll by coming via the Baymore rural roads, which simply cannot accommodate that level of traffic going through the village of Julianstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The points have been well made regarding the challenge the imposition of tolls presents for people's bottom line. We have to be conscious of the difficulties people are facing. The Government is, as was said earlier, merely kicking the can down the road, and this will come back to bite us in the middle of next year. My understanding is that the chief executive of TII made clear today that there will be additional increases to tolls in 2024, including in both directions on the M1 outside of Drogheda. We are facing a rolling series of toll increases, which will be a significant imposition on the people of the area I am proud to represent.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_840">It is difficult to see any justification for the increase in tolls, whether they come into effect in six months or in January as originally planned. With private motorists and haulage companies struggling with increasing fuel costs, any rise in toll prices will come as a further blow amid the cost-of-living crisis. The level of the increase is difficult to justify in the current climate and I do not foresee that changing in the next six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> We all appreciate the need to reduce the use of cars in daily travel, but many people use these motorways daily because the current level of public transport is not sufficient. In the case of the State-owned M50, one of the country's most notorious bottlenecks, it is intended to heap even further misery on road users, with an increase in the toll of more than 9%. For people living in, for example, Blanchardstown who have to travel to Lucan, that will amount to €500 a year before these increases kick in. That is assuming they go back and forth every day. The tolls are not applied equally on roads throughout the country. They apply most commonly where there is a daily commuter element.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> The M50 has never been busier and is about as busy it can get while still functioning. In its most recent annual report, TII predicts that any drop in traffic volumes on the M50 will be in reaction to the rising level of congestion. The road is often like a car park and is already expensive to use. We in the Committee of Public Accounts examined this issue earlier in the year and found that, internationally, the M50 was the only free-flow toll road that escalated instances of non-payment to a fine on day two. It is easy for people to forget to pay the toll online, especially for those who are not familiar with the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> All the PPP motorways were set up to bring in the maximum tolls allowed under their agreements with the State, excluding the port tunnel. It was stated in the House last week that this was to be the first increase in nine years, but there was an increase earlier this year, as the Minister of State acknowledged. I thought I was hearing things last week when the Tánaiste said otherwise, and I thought perhaps he does not realise because he probably does not tend to stop at toll bridges and that, therefore, increases do not have the same impact on him. The maximum toll allowable in PPP contracts is linked to inflation. Operators have the option of charging less than the maximum, yet all of them charge as much as they can. I do not believe there is any record of an operator dropping a toll price when the rate of inflation has decreased. The rises, linked to an inflation rate of 8.6% between August 2021 and August 2022, are in most cases higher than the 9% increase. They are rounding up the cost, which is shaking down people for as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> While it is welcome the increases will be delayed for six months, it is expected to cost the State at least €12.5 million to cover the lost revenue for TII and the toll operators. As was noted earlier, representatives of TII are appearing before the transport committee as we speak. If the freezing of toll charges were agreed, the contractual entitlement to the index linking of toll charges would still exist. If inflation continues to rise, this will result in the rebalancing of, and consequentially larger increases to, toll charges in January 2024. We are not resolving the problem but just pushing it down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> Why did the announcement from TII come as a surprise last week? When did TII flag this? Surely as a State body, it has to keep the Department of Transport apprised. It has been reported TII and that Department have been discussing the matter since the beginning of September, so why did it seem to come as a surprise to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste? There is a reason the PPP schemes were so attractive to private contractors, namely, the fact that, by and large, they are very lucrative. Profits in 2021 for the Eurolink Motorway Operations, which operates the M3, the M4 and the M6 were €10.8 million; for Celtic Roads Group in Dundalk, €8.14 million; for Directroute Holdings, operating the M17 and the M18, €15.3 million; for Directroute Limited, operating the M8, €6.2 million; and for M50 Concession Limited, €2.4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Included in these profit margins is the overpayment of tolls, an issue I have raised repeatedly. Every toll operator receives an overpayment, which is retained as income. The average yearly income from overpayment ranges from about €18,000 for the N6 to €78,000 for the M7 and the M8. Where people overpay a toll, this is included in the revenue as though it is the legitimate revenue of the toll operator, but I do not believe it is legitimate. The toll operators say they use it on road maintenance, which is the excuse for everything. Dublin Bus, for example, has a community initiative to which its overpayments go, yet according to a reply I received during a discussion at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, this was never considered by any of the toll operators as an option. They are taking money over and above the stated sum whereby if the toll is, say, €1.90 and someone pays €2, they retain that 10 cent and that can be very lucrative.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> All this raises a question as to why road users are facing an increase in tolls and why we are subsidising the loss of excess profits for these operators. The answer can be found in PPP contracts, where the ghost of Fianna Fáil past is coming back to haunt us. The PPP scheme is a perfect example of the Fianna Fáil legacy of selling or leasing public assets to private companies with favourable conditions and cushy contracts. When the party was extolling the virtues of the PPP scheme, a key benefit was supposed to be the transfer of risk to the private contractor, which would limit costs and losses for the State. The PPP schemes were, supposedly, structured such that private toll operators would be responsible for demand risks, including traffic volumes and, therefore, toll revenue. The traffic risk was supposed to be transferred to the PPP company, yet we retain an obligation at least on some roads and tunnels to compensate for the shortfall in traffic volumes that has been forecast. I do not know how one aligns with the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> TII must explain the rationale behind these toll increases. It is difficult to accept its contention that the toll rises are necessary for the maintenance of motorways and the wider public network. What is motor tax for, people will ask, if they pay a toll charge of which some goes towards the maintenance of roads while others do not pay that toll charge? There seems to be a terrible inequality in that. Moreover, we see toll avoidance all over the place, although it is not unique to Ireland and can be seen in other jurisdictions as well. Ordinary people will end up paying twice for these increases, in higher tolls through any cost passed on to consumers due to additional operational expenses incurred in logistics and distribution companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> The Committee of Public Accounts asked TII earlier this year whether there were any concerns about transport projects becoming unviable due to inflationary concerns. We were told that was a very low risk because these projects were appraised for periods of 30 to 60 years, and while the rate of inflation was high, it was not expected fundamentally to disturb projects in the longer term. The contracts with the toll operators run to between 30 and 45 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Does the same logic not apply here where it evens out over a longer period? When a new road is built, there is normally not much maintenance on the road surface for approximately 20 years. A big overlay of approximately four inches then goes on, which means another ten years before maintenance is required. Very often, these toll roads can sweat the asset so that they do not have to do the maintenance at a time when inflation is high. Therefore, this idea that people are all rushing out now to resurface roads when inflation is high is nonsensical. I have not seen any evidence of it. Deferring the toll increases to a later date when the increases will become even higher than was forecast is not good enough. The Government needs to show a bit of backbone and fight the operators on this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> It should be noted that the toll bridges, which are entirely publicly owned and operated, will not be raising their prices. Dublin City Council has no plans in the next year to raise tolls on the Tom Clarke Bridge. Dublin City Council made an income of €7.18 million this year from bridge tolls. It is a lot of money but less than some private operators, which intend to raise tolls. Really, the difference is that it is a public entity as opposed to a private company.</p>

          <p eId="para_869"> The Government indicated it is going to pay to put off the toll increases. The people who use these roads will obviously welcome that. They are not going to be hit by these toll increases for six months. The Government is still handing over €12.5 million to these private companies, however. The public is still being robbed and will still pay for it but just in another form. The scandal, therefore, continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> It is worth retracing our steps to see how we got here and how we have this system of public private partnership where the public takes all the risk and the private sector takes all the profit. We need absolutely to bring an end to it. We need to take these out of private ownership and bring them into public control.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> There was a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> at the weekend with a headline that read, "Who runs Ireland’s road tolls and who gets the money? International investment funds provide the money, and take the risk, for our motorway network." That is the ideology and the propaganda. It tries to suggest the private interests that run most of the toll roads ran a risk and, therefore, in some way have a legitimate expectation of getting a profit. That was the ideological basis of PPPs in this State, not just in roads but in schools and other important projects like social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> The truth is that, when we examine it, the private actors in the motorways ran no risks. When the Roche family and their friends in Fianna Fáil did the deal on the M50 toll road in the 1980s, there was no risk. The State built the motorway. The only remaining link that National Toll Roads, NTR, built did not leave any option for motorists to flyover or bypass the link. It was a cash cow delivered to a wealthy dynasty that set them up for generations to come. We were sold a con then. We were told that, by using private enterprise, the State would avoid funding all the costs of key infrastructure, the public would save money, in return, the private companies ran a risk that they could lose the money, and - this was the idea - we got these roads, schools and houses at a supposedly bargain price. Of course, it was a nonsense. These people were not doing it for the good of their health. They were doing it because they were very out to make a very substantial profit. That was nonsense then and it is nonsense now, and it is being used to contract out core State responsibilities and fatten the profit margins of already wealthy investors and company owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> The twists and turns in share ownership and buyouts since the start of PPPs are part of the same process of financialisation in which key public goods have been plundered by various vested interests, again with the public picking up the tab. The justification for these increases to the effect that the contract allows for it and deferring it will mean larger increases later follows a pattern that has been repeated again and again without looking at the question of how we got here. We got here because of the hold of new liberal ideas on the Government and core actors in the State. It was presented that private sector involvement in any project was unquestionably seen as a good thing whereas the public sector was seen as inherently inefficient, unionised, backward and so on. We have the result of all this policy and we can draw a balance sheet on it. The truth is that the policy has been a disaster. It means that, when we face a cost-of-living crisis, as we do, we are told we cannot prevent hikes in tolls because of the PPPs or, in this case, we can prevent them temporarily but we have to pay for it. At key moments, PPPs and the privatisation beyond them remove the ability of the State, or certainly weaken its ability, to control costs and provide key services.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> We might look at the facts of it, which suggest the private sector did not ever risk its wealth in this process. An Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report in 2018 found that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_875">A striking feature of our analysis is the revelation that road PPP projects are mainly financed by the public sector. Our analysis has established that the public sector has contributed €1.01 billion in construction payments, in addition to €1.17 billion spent on land acquisition costs. Although private finance contributed over €1.8 billion of investment in the projects analysed, of this over €590 million was borrowed from the EIB which is a major lender of public funds to the private PPP companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The report also found that while PPPs accounted for one third of Ireland's motorway networks, the use of PPPs at that time had not been subject to any review or analysis by the State. Therefore, far from saving the State money, even in the initial building stage, PPPs in roads cost us and people continue to pay dearly via charges as well as directly subsidising the private sector. Those who gain are the operators who have been returning profits despite the slowdown during Covid 19. The M1 at Gormanstown made €8 million last year for Celtic Roads. The Portlaoise bypass made €4 million for it. The Waterford bypass made it €3 million. Eurolink made €5 million from the M4, almost €6 million from the M3 and so on. That was just in the last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Toll roads and PPPs are the gift that continues to give for many of Ireland's wealthiest and some of the globe's largest investment funds. We know the Roche family via National Toll Roads made a vast amount on the M50 deal. We also know, as reported in the <i>Business Post</i> some years ago, that the State paid a staggering €600 million to NTR to buy out the West-Link toll bridge operation. It is estimated that NTR earned over €1.15 billion from the motorway project, which was built at a cost of around €60 million. An array of international funds, private corporations and Irish rich have made a killing from PPPs. These deals, which were presented as a good deal for the public and so on, were in reality always designed to transfer wealth from the public to very rich private operators, and they continue to fulfil that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The hikes which motorists face during the cost of living crisis are just the latest episode in a long-running saga of how the main political parties in this State, especially Fianna Fáil, have forced ordinary people to pay for those profits in various different ways. That continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> One can see the situation where the companies are forced to delay their increases but they get it from the public in another way because the State simply pays them not to do it. It is a scandal. The way to bring an end to it is to take these toll roads, which have already made a very significant amount of money for their private owners,out of private ownership, to bring them into public ownership and to run them in the interests of the public.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_880">I welcome Sinn Féin's motion and thank them for taking the lead from Aontú, which raised this issue last May and again on 17 November. The State right now is involved in highway robbery across this country. It is an incredible situation that it is shaking down commuters who are living in commuter hell at the moment right around the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> Families are hammered with the cost of living and are finding it difficult to pay for cars, to get them fixed and to pay for fuel. Moreover, nearly 50% of the cost of the fuel that they are paying for is actually going to the Government. The Government is collecting more in fuel taxes today than it did before the cost-of-living crisis raised its ugly head. It is an incredible situation that this is taking place and it is no small money for families. Families in my constituency of Meath are often forced to go through three tolls on the way to work and three on the way back. People are paying well over €2,000 to use the tolls in this State. The worst thing about that is that they are spending this money on an annual basis and are still spending three hours a day in traffic and traffic jams, and are being made to pay for the pleasure of that traffic jam through the toll that this Government is using. </p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The truth of the matter, let us be honest, is that the tolls are a cash cow now in this State. The M50 cost £58 million to build. The PPP company that signed the contract with Pádraig Flynn, who a tribunal found received £8,000 back from the PPP company, made more money in one year than was the cost of building those two bridges. In one year, the company had paid off that entire debt at the time. The State then paid €1.3 billion for those bridges, which were built for £58 million. What is happening is absolutely sickening and the Government is literally milking people on the way to work. It is a tax on work and on commuters and people have no other option in respect of public transport in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> We have been campaigning for a rail line to be built from Navan to Dublin for the past 15 years and one of the reasons it has not been built is because it would take people from the motorway, would reduce the tolls going to the toll company, and the State would have to make up the difference. It is heads we win and tails you lose and this is the deal the Government has created with these toll companies. Right now the Government should end the cost of the M50 toll and help people who are struggling.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_884">While the Government is spending billions to ease acute cost-of-living pressures, it is then taking it back in the form of tolls. The highest rise in tolls of 60 cent per journey was confirmed last week by the State agency Transport Infrastructure Ireland, with the blessing of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. While the decision to defer these increases for six months announced today was welcome, this leads to kicking the issue down the road. Let us take note that the decision by Transport Infrastructure Ireland flies in the face of Government policies. As these private companies are already making millions of euro in profits, how can Transport Infrastructure Ireland justify the increase in toll charges to the maximum permitted value? I am aware that the surge in inflation has resulted in the higher cost of materials for road repairs and the general rising cost of operations. My question, however, would be to ask whether toll prices need to increase to their maximum permitted value. Just last month, for example, the M3 toll operators reported €11 million in profit for the previous financial year. While this will be the first rise in M50 tolls for a decade, an additional point I will make is that we have paid for this infrastructure ten times over. Research shows that commuters have already paid €1.2 billion for the M50 tolls in the past nine years. Taxpayers have already paid millions of euro in traffic-guarantee payments to private toll companies over the past three years due to the low levels of traffic on the motorways as a result of the pandemic. These toll increases are only further taxation. It does not matter what label one puts on it because it is a further taxation in a highly-taxed environment. </p>
          <p eId="para_885"> The M50 brought in €140 million in revenue last year, which was a year of curtailed movement and economic activity and it has brought in €1.2 billion over the past ten years. This is not just on the M50 but it is happening all over the country. These are some of the most attractive companies for public private partnership contracts and they are cash cows. These are huge revenue-raisers for the State for reinvestment in our road network but what has happened now is in an undefined and unexplained grab for the maximum allowance of revenue for these companies under the guise of keeping up with inflation. </p>
          <p eId="para_886"> Rural areas within my constituency of Louth and east Meath will be the hardest hit by all these toll increases. Whether that is now or in six months' time, the situation will not change. These are the people who are dependent on private car use due to the lack of transport infrastructure. </p>
          <p eId="para_887"> A key goal of policy is to get people out of their cars, which will inevitably involve higher charges for motorists across a range of areas. I understand that there is a modal shift to change to public transport and perhaps this is the main reason for the Minister’s support for this increase. However, I am disappointed that the 8.6% rise in the toll from 21 August 2021 to August 2022 is being continued by Transport Infrastructure Ireland against this maximum increase. Big hikes in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis are not a good idea. Does the Minister know that inflation will have settled by June and the cost of living crisis will have abated? If inflation rates are low, will that mean that the increase will not be required? What is the general idea about kicking the can down the road? It is the regular users which will be exposed, including commercial fleets and daily commuters and the timing could hardly be worse. All the Minister is doing is robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p>

          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_888">I thank Sinn Féin for preparing this motion and for bringing it forward. The toll increase is just another example of the arms of the State imposing greater costs on people during the cost-of-living crisis. Much of what I would have said has already been said about the money these toll companies are making. The Minister is only too well aware of the many proposals that have been put to him, and to the Minister of State that was here before him in the Chamber, on whether we are getting value for money. As the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, he knows that the toll barrier at Dublin Port, although it is free for trucks, causes 100 tonnes of carbon emissions a day to be put into the atmosphere. It affects our lung health in the worst possible way. What is the cost of that? The Minister has already told me on the floor of the House here that it is a safety issue and that the barrier cannot be removed. The geniuses we have in TII are unable to come up with a solution, although no other country in Europe uses a toll at the entrance to a port tunnel. Some 40,000 l of fuel a day are being expended and wasted. That is a cost of €80,000 to the hauliers who operate the trucks and God knows what it costs us as a country to pay the fine to the EU for the excessive noxious emissions it causes. This is all counterintuitive and it is a bit disingenuous to turn around to TII with the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, who is receiving a very good wage, and who should have identified that this issue would arise. For years, we have all known that the cost of tolls is linked to inflation. At the worst possible time, in a cost-of-living crisis, we receive notification that the toll is going to rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> Equally, we charge trucks in this country based on their size. They pay more than any other vehicle using the tolls. That is incorrect. The bigger the truck and the more axles it has, the less damage it does to the roads. That is the idea, whereby the weight is distributed across more axles causing less damage. These trucks should actually be paying less. They should be in the realm of coach transport, with a charge of €2.30 or €3, or whatever the charge is. Instead, the charge is nearly €7. </p>
          <p eId="para_890"> The €12 million which the Minister has saved, as he sees it, for the people and for the consumer still has to be paid, where someone has to pay tax to make it up and is €12 million which has been raised through the Exchequer. The reality is that we have to look at these contracts and see if we are getting value for money. The value for money for me would be not to have vehicles stopping unnecessarily, and expending fuel in order to raise revenue. Every toll in this country should be the same as the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Every truck in Europe uses an express lane rather than expending fuel by taking off, having paid a toll. It is a ridiculous scenario. Will the Minister at the least, through the PPPs, put express lanes in, utilise them and give us value for money? If not, we are only robbing Peter to pay Paul and paying it back through climate measures we have not complied with. We sign up to emission targets. How can we make them when obstacles like this are put in our way? Expending 40,000 unnecessary litres of fuel getting into Dublin city every day of the year is outrageous. I hope, if nothing else comes out of this, this will come out of it. </p>

          <p eId="para_894"> This is another fine mess the Minister has got us into. As Minister for Transport when this broke, he showed no cop on, copped out and went to COP27. I heard the Tánaiste saying it was wrong and might not happen. I heard the Taoiseach say something similar but they had to wait until the man himself came back from Egypt. I heard him when he came back saying we could not look at it again, that it was an agreed deal unless the money we get from this came from someplace else and that he was putting the money directly into projects. No doubt they are some of the Minister's pet Green Party projects. I want to know cad a tharla. Cad a tharla? "Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? ... Níl trácht ar Chill Chais". What has happened? How did the change come about?</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I have no hang-up about public private partnerships. I welcomed them when they started but it is the ineptitude of our system whereby senior management in Departments cannot seem to get any fair contract for the taxpayers. Look at the children’s hospital, broadband and scandal after scandal. No doubt there is another project which I am aghast the Minister is still thinking of going ahead with, namely, piping water from Tiobraid Árann to Baile Átha Cliath. Before someone says I have something against Dublin, I do not but it is mad and daft, considering the size of the pipe, the damage to the ecology, flora and fauna and the whole excavation, to pump it to Dublin with 48% leakage. The Government could not fix it though it had the ideal opportunity to do so during Covid, when there was not a vehicle on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> Getting back to taxpayers, I travelled to Cavan last night from Tipperary. My colleague travelled from west Cork and has been through six tolls. A person was on to my office today who lives in my constituency and works in Cork. Between tolls and fuels, it now costs €8,000 for that person to travel to Cork to work from Tipperary, which is 60 or 70 miles at most. That is savage. She gets no tax allowance for that. No one takes account of that as regards her wages and the taxes she pays. It is criminal. </p>
          <p eId="para_897"> I heard Deputy Verona Murphy talk about the toll bridge. What about all the fumes and pollution with all this stop-start? We know how hard trucks are on fuel. Of course, the more axles on a truck, the less damage on the roads. The Government does not seem to get that and is fleecing the lorry drivers. It is massive. Think of that both ways. It is incredible. Why did the Minister allow this to happen? He had representatives of this company contacting his Department. That is what I understood. He had somebody looking into it and knew this would happen before he flew off to Egypt. He was forewarned. He can tell me I am wrong if he wants. If he did not know, he should have. He must have some oversight over these bodies or does he just allow them to charge what they like and gouge who they like?</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> More important is the issue concerning the TII. I thought the National Roads Authority, NRA, was stood down and TII set up. I found out lately from a person who gave me a lift and who works in one of those agencies that both exist. They are still there. Why is it that we need all these big boards?</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> I was delighted when we decommissioned the NRA. I said for years we decommissioned the IRA and could not stand down the NRA. Its representatives are impossible and arrogance oozes out of them. I meet TII representatives if I can meet them. You would meet the Pope a lot more easily. I have met the Pope three times. The disdain you get from them. They put up signs outside Showerings, or Bulmers, in Clonmel and increased it just inside of a junction from 50 km/h to 100 km/h when people are coming out of Redmondstown junction in fear of their life trying to turn right. We met the TII, NRA or whoever the hell they were, and they would not listen to us. It was the same in Carrick-on-Suir. They put a 100 mph speed limit on the N24 right into the Tinvane estate and the two estates coming out there. It is unsafe for people coming out. Would they listen to us? We were treated with arrogance. Councillor Kieran Bourke and I, along with Deputy Cahill I think, were at the meeting and it was still the same. People are in fear for their lives but you cannot talk to these unelected quangos that show contempt for public representatives. We have to meet the people and try to work with officials to make things safer. </p>
          <p eId="para_900"> An Teachta O'Donoghue will talk about the N7 between Portlaoise and Limerick, as he travels it every day. It is a warpath. When it rains, the drainage is obviously wrong, the camber is wrong and there is something wrong with the surface. I am not an expert but I know a bit about roadmaking. That is what people tell me who are experts. Members of the Garda are called out to accidents and are afraid for their lives. People have lost their lives and been maimed on it. There is accident after accident because of wrong drainage, wrong bitumen in the finished project and a wrong camber. It is a recipe for disaster and is unfair to motorists. There is a sign up now catching them for the average speed they do between two cameras. I have no problem with that but have a problem that the Government cannot put up flashing lights when it rains to warn of water ponding on the roads. It is a new motorway. Members of the Garda will say privately there is something wrong with it because they are out there every day. Council officials will say it, but not publicly. The Government will not give in, but people are unsuspecting.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> It is the same away on the M8 between Cahir and Mitchelstown. On mountainy terrain in the Galtee Mountains, inferior pipes were put in. I said it at the time. There are 8-inch pipes taking water from streams that a 10-foot pipe would not take. The road is getting flooded and unsuspecting motorists are being wiped out, upside down, jackknifed trucks, you name it. It is scandalous that we have roads like that. Since the drains were put in and the roads opened ten years ago at least, nobody looked at the inlets or the drains. They are all blocked and streams are blocked and water is flowing down onto the motorway for the last six weeks. Government says it is fine, it is delivered and the PPP is finished and signed off on. The people who built it are gone. They did a good job but we need maintenance on these motorways. We need to make sure water is not getting onto them. Ecology and waterfalls change. Nobody is looking at the drainage or up in Coillte at the different happenings up there. There are huge issues that need to be rectified. </p>

          <p eId="para_902">The question is whether motorists will be hit with the highest permitted toll charge hikes, up to 60 cent per journey, across the country in six months' time, following the decision to raise tolls in line with inflation. This is another attack on the car and other road vehicles, which will add fuel to the cost-of-living pressures on motorists, hauliers and other transport operators. The Minister has been blasé about this, accepting it and leaving it happen behind the scenes. Is this another attack on the motorist?</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> Increasing toll prices will greatly increase pressures on commuters and businesses during the cost-of-living crisis. Why would the Government-owned M50 up its tolls by just over 9% while the Government also allows PPP motorways to bring in maximum tolls under agreements with the State? Will the new prices come into effect in six months?</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> In a recent statement, the State roads operator, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, confirmed the State and the PPP companies have discretion in setting the tolls while they are restricted from increasing the tolls beyond inflation. They do not have to match rising consumer prices. Vans, trucks and buses will also see toll increases if this happens. Tagged goods vehicles less than 2,000 kg and buses will be charged €3.80, up from €3, on video and an increase of 30 cent to €4.40 if unregistered, that is, up from €4.10. Where is all this money going? In the name of God, what are we doing? This is a cash cow. As has been said several times today, it is highway robbery of the ordinary mother and father, who are trying hard to survive. The Government is quite happy to allow that to happen because motorists are paying tax, carbon tax and 50% of the price of fuel to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, yesterday I went to Cavan for the launch of Shane P. O'Reilly's campaign running for the Rural Independent Group in the next election and came back last night. I passed six tolls on the way up. While people might say I can afford it, it is a scandalous waste to be throwing money into an old basket for people who do not have the tag. It is a fair con job, I must say. When I go into Northern Ireland I can drive around freely. It has no toll bridges. How can they survive without hitting their people in the pocket as much as we do?</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> While it is difficult, it would be fine if the money was distributed to pay for roads throughout the country, but the roads in west Cork are scandalous. I raised that issue with the Taoiseach today. I raised the issue of the Innishannon bypass where not a sod is turned nor a brick or a piece of tar laid there. The same is true of the southern relief road in Bandon, the northern relief road in Bandon and the Bantry relief road. I mentioned all those earlier on Leaders' Questions because we need to survive. We need to promote west Cork. Over recent years I have fought very hard. Sadly, the Cork Taoiseach is coming to the end of his term and he has never allowed any progress on any of those projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> An independent report recently showed that Cork County Council is 52 years behind other counties on roads infrastructure and funding for different projects. When I raised that today, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan started giving out suggesting that I should not be representing these views for the people of west Cork. He will not gag me and nobody will gag me, thank God. Only the people of Cork South-West will have their say over me and anything I might say about roads or other genuine issues in west Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> Why can we not have a couple of simple passing bays? That is all we are asking for - not high flyovers or anything. Around Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen someone might spend half an hour or up to 40 minutes behind a lorry or tractor, which is scandalous. We need to have a clear understanding that passing bays can be put into these areas. I need to work with them, but Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan says I am talking negatively. I am actually talking positively because we need change here. While he might accept second best for west Cork, I will not accept second best for west Cork and I will never do that while I stand here in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> I have discussed public transport with the Minister on numerous occasions. I look at the money that is being wasted. I know there has been much good footpath infrastructure done and footpaths need to be done. The other day I was going into Castletownbere, as I do fairly often. I know the Minister loves west Cork. If he takes a trip down there some day, he can give me a shout and I will take him up there. Honest to God, I might nearly consider landing a plane on some of the footpaths. It is outrageous. People tell me if there is a lorry with a Hymac and it meets another, they have to drive up on the footpath. What in the name of God is going on? It is lovely to see a new footpath. I absolutely welcome that, but not the unbelievably sized footpaths that are bigger than the roads themselves when they are looked at from both sides. It is absolutely insane.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Tolls are a vicious charge as it is. While we are discussing roads, driving and the tolls, I plead with the Minister to look at the driving instructor situation in Skibbereen. There were two permanent driving testers and one has already moved on with the second one due to move on soon. People who applied for a test two or three weeks ago were told they would get a test in three months which is a bit unfair, but we would live with that. Now some people who applied last Friday have been told they must wait six months. There is a serious situation there. A Senator from west Cork said last week that I was scaremongering. I am inundated with calls from people ringing me and my office asking why they cannot get a driving test within two or three months, which is somewhat acceptable, but not for five or six months which is not acceptable. I plead with the Minister to find out what the situation is. Will Skibbereen have full-time driving testers available on 1 January 2023? I will not accept second best. Maybe Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan and the Senator from west Cork might, but I would never do that for the people of west Cork.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard O'Donoghue<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_911">The Government does not want transition; it just wants tax. Every time someone turns, it is tax. In the Minister's last address to us here on COP, he mentioned the trillions of euro made by fossil fuel companies. However, he forgot to say that it was great because we are charging people 50% tax on that fossil fuel in this country without transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> The Minister wears glasses and I wear glasses for driving. When I come to Dublin, I stay outside Dublin. I come in here every morning and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and I queue in the traffic coming into Dublin because the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not have the transport to get people around Dublin. There are 2.2 million vehicles in the country and he cannot even get it right in Dublin. He cannot provide adequate transport for young families who take their children to school or crèche. If they get sick, the parents need to go back and collect them. The Minister cannot provide it in Dublin, but he reckons he will do it all around the country and penalise every person who has no other opportunity but to drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> He then looked to increasing the tolls. Along with my fellow Members from the Rural Independent Group I was in Cavan last night to launch Shane P. O'Reilly's campaign for the next general election. I also travelled from Limerick through four tolls to get to Cavan. Who is taking the money?</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> In rural areas throughout the country out of respect, we go to the funerals of the families and friends of the people we represent. What does the Government do? It taxes us to go to pay our respects at funerals. Limerick has been in four all-Ireland finals in the last five years. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, cannot even give us real transport to get us here and therefore we must drive. That is why they call it the sea of green coming up to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is a failed Minister. He fails to understand the people of Ireland and fails to understand transition. Not one person in this country does not believe in global warming. Not one person in this country does not realise that we must do something. However, everyone in the country believes in transition, but the Minister and his Government do not. If the infrastructure is put in, it will transition itself into public transport and will reduce the amount of emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> Other Deputies have spoken tonight about the toll at the port. How many tonnes of emissions is it causing at the ports? The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, came to Limerick and went to Foynes. He ran around all the places. He said it was lovely in Limerick and that we need to get things going. Since I was elected to this House, I have been asking him to get Foynes Port, the deepest port in Europe, up and running but it has not happened. Whose pocket is he in up here? They say that he is allowing all the transport come to Dublin at seven miles to the gallon coming up and down the motorway. He is supposed to represent the whole country in transition and he is a failed Minister. He cannot do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> He said he went to COP - to tell the truth what he has done is cop a bull. He has done nothing but brought hardship for every person in this country, including the people of Dublin by failing to give them transport. He has also failed to provide transport to his own Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media who spends two hours in a queue of traffic with me every day. It is 11 miles from here to the Red Cow interchange. It takes me an hour and 40 minutes in high traffic because of the Minister's failure to free up the traffic in Dublin, which is overpopulated. It is a failure by him and his Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> The Minister then decided to close half the streets even around Leinster House. Now we cannot even get around the streets. It takes me 40 minutes to get around to the other side so I can actually head towards the Red Cow interchange. Again, it is a failure of Government. I asked the Minister to look at the traffic light system here. When one light goes red, the next four lights are green on a straight road. I asked him to look at the timing of them. Again, it would save emissions because they will get traffic moving. He failed to do that and he stands up here then and claims they are doing this, that and the other for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The Minister spoke about taking Ministers out to COP27. He took one Minister of State who looks after forestry and dairy in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">Yes. That is what he thinks of this country. He talks about forestry. His other failure is that in 2012 we knew there was a problem with ash dieback. The Government was told but it did nothing about it. What did it do? It let all the forests with ash dieback fail. It said it would give people €1,000 to clear the land. That is what it did. It was another failure of the Minister. When we add all of the Minister's failures to his resumé when he finishes, I hope everyone in this country understands that the Green Party Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not understand transition. The only transition he understands is in the bubble in space where he thinks he is Captain Spock and he is going from here to there expediently. That is his transition. Transition for Ireland is everyone moving together, not penalising everyone through the Minister's failure to introduce equality for everyone. That is his failure.</p>

          <p eId="para_933">We maintained the revenue diesel rebate scheme to recognise that we were in difficult times. We will defer the increase even though it was proposed to provide for the cost of inflation, particularly in road maintenance and operations, which are important. We must maintain that service for the Irish public and we will do that. That money will not come from cuts to the road maintenance budget because it is important we keep maintaining the roads rather than coming back later. It is cheaper that way. Nor will it be taken out from the public transport budget, which particularly for rural Ireland is increasing significantly. I will give the Local Link rural transport services as an example of where there has been a major expansion. The budget for Local Link has increased from €12 million in 2016 to over €28 million this year and we are not stopping there.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> I am proud that we are starting to roll out Connecting Ireland bus services from County Limerick into Limerick city, from Galway to all over the country, and in west Cork. They provide regular return services that were not provided in the past because we recognise we have to make this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> It is not an easy time in the country or in the world. It is difficult and challenging but all of those measures have been done. They are provided for in the budget and elsewhere to try to protect people through this difficult time. We also need to maintain services and income streams to pay for services. The cost of bitumen has gone very high, making it very expensive to put a dress or topping on a new road. That more than anything else is expensive. We need revenue streams to pay for that. It is how the world goes around and keeps working. This Government is doing that and is serving our people to the very best of our ability.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">While the six-month delay will be welcomed by many people, it is a case of kicking the can down the road. In fact, so many cans have been kicked down the road by this Government, it will make a fortune in the new cash for cans recycling measures when they are introduced in 2024. When the hikes come in they will hit people's pockets. They will hit the pockets of workers, businesses and families at a time when their finances are already under unprecedented pressure due to the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> While I am glad the Minister has put a break on them for the time being, these unfair price hikes can and must be stopped for good. This is not a measure that will help the toll road companies pay the bills and meet increases in costs. These are very profitable companies. We have heard time and again how profitable they are. With the permission of the State, they are profiteering and price gouging.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> There will be other consequences for the people where I live in Dublin West, in Strawberry Beds, Lucan, Castleknock and Clonsilla, because it will mean heavier traffic as people try to save money by avoiding the tolls when the increases come in. The empty M3 will remain a virtual ghost road as people use the old N3 to avoid the price gouging. It will also impact on hauliers, increase transport costs and push up the price of food and other goods. When we talk about the cost of living, this is the cost of living. </p>
          <p eId="para_940"> One issue that deeply frustrates people who have to use these toll roads on a daily basis is that they pay road tax. Every year, the bill comes in and they pay and then they pay again and again every single day. The cost-of-living crisis is affecting so many workers, families and individuals. I appeal to the Minister not just to give them a temporary break but to stop the road toll hikes into the future. What we have seen over the years is that the road deals, the public private partnerships or PPPs, given to these private companies make hundreds of millions, if not billions of euro over the term. I heard there is a 40-year term in one of them. That is outrageous.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">I thank Deputy O'Rourke for tabling the motion before the House. This Government needs to start standing up for the people who are in need of help. People are sick and tired of seeing a Government watch while others take advantage of the people. The Government only responds in the interests of the public when pressure from the Opposition or elsewhere becomes too much to bear. We have seen this with its slowness to act in the areas of windfall taxes and decoupling gas from electricity prices while energy providers have used the war in Ukraine to boost their massive profits. We have seen similar foot-dragging from the Government when it came to implementing an eviction ban as people deal with the cost-of-living and the housing crises throughout the winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> The Department of Transport was made aware of this planned toll hike in early September. It did absolutely nothing until it was faced with public opinion and a motion that called it out on its inaction. The Minister then announced a freeze on the increases until next year. That is welcome for now, but what plans does he have in place for next July? Will he let the toll companies have free reign again and hike its charges even further? It is another Government-sponsored sticking plaster. What it needs to do between now and then is assess the funding for our roads network and review the value for money of PPP contracts. In our alternative budget we proposed savings for next year by reducing the threshold for cars that qualify for EV grants from €60,000 to €50,000. Whether the Minister likes it or not, if someone is ready to spend that much on a car, they do not need financial support, no more than they need a tax break for a private jet. This would have created space to deal with the cost of these toll hikes and would have spared the Minister his last-minute scrambling to see how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can find the money to fund the U-turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> Is the temporary freezing of tolls meant to lessen the impact of the Minister for Finance's decision to reintroduce bonuses for senior bankers. I will tell the Minister one thing. I look forward to the day when we can shake off the damage done to us by decisions made by successive Fianna Fáil-led Administrations which, among other things, gift gold-plated contracts that permit these toll increases. With Fine Gael and the Green Party, Fianna Fáil now wants to reward senior bankers with outrageous bonuses while families are forced to tighten their belts even further.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">I thank all Members who contributed to the debate. It was important and timely and we saw some response from the Government on this issue. That response is late, however, and it does not go far enough. The Government knew as far back as early September that these proposed hikes were to come in in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">That is the time when a Minister for Transport who was in tune with the needs and lived experience of small business owners, of people driving vans trying to make ends meet, of commuters who get up early in the morning and get home late at night while working in the construction trades or wherever else, of haulage companies, for which he or she technically has responsibility and which would be faced with an €8 million bill if these proposed hikes came in, and of people who have to commute for dialysis, school, work or caring responsibilities in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, when notified of these proposed increases, would have said "No way", that they could not proceed and that we had to find another way. That did not happen. The Minister has never, at any stage, said that. We have heard it from other Government party representatives and from other Government party leaders but we have never heard it from Deputy Ryan, the Minister with responsibility for the area. I welcome the fact that he is in the Chamber but we did not hear that from him even tonight. </p>
          <p eId="para_946"> In his deliberations, we heard that, whatever about the tolls, we knew where the money was not coming from. It was not coming from public transport or active travel and that, after that, it was somebody else's problem. It is the same tonight. In his contribution, the Minister pointed to measures the Government has taken. We support and have supported these measures and have prepared policy documents asking him to take different approaches and to go further with regard to public transport and active travel. We support such measures and our representatives will help deliver them in local communities. However, the Minister cannot ignore the fact that he has responsibility for the whole gamut of transport and that very many people have no alternative. They do not have the opportunity to switch to an electric vehicle, public transport or active travel. The Minister cannot ignore the plight of those people. </p>
          <p eId="para_947"> The fact that we have left it from 1 September until 29 November to act on this tells me that this is a Government and a Ministry that is not in tune with people's needs. As we speak, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII representatives are before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, scratching their heads and wondering whether they can get this done for 1 January because these are complex matters involving private contracts and a number of different parties. There is no guarantee and the mechanism will have to be negotiated. Without a shadow of a doubt, had TII been asked to do this on 1 September, it would have had a better chance of delivering it on 1 January. I encourage the Minister to take this motion and the debate tonight with him and to impress on the Department of Transport, on TII and on those profitable public private partnership, PPP, companies that they must ensure this measure is in place for 1 January. </p>
          <p eId="para_948"> However, as we have said, the Minister needs to go further than that. The period of six months is not long enough. During that time, I encourage the Minister to look at the funding mechanism for our national roads network. We have heard from TII that we invest approximately 2% of the value of our roads in their maintenance while 33% of this maintenance is dependent on tolls from the M50. That is the scheme we have built. It is based on PPP contracts and privatisation and represents a failure of Government to deliver on its responsibilities through general taxation. It is a failed model that is crucifying ordinary people and it needs to be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_949"> We also need a tolling scheme that incentivises the most efficient use of our roads. We have heavy goods vehicles and people in private cars avoiding the tolls by taking more minor roads, causing congestion. This is not an efficient use of our network and increases emissions, costs and congestion. It needs to be addressed and the Minister is responsible for doing that. I do not have confidence that he will but surely he has heard loud and clear from the commuting public that it needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_952">I thank Deputy Kerrane for raising this issue. As of 1 October 2022, over 75,000 applications for additional needs payments, ANPs, were processed and payments awarded. This represents a 63% increase in awarded payments compared with the same period in 2021. My Department has already paid an estimated €46 million in ANPs so far this year. Some of this increase can be attributed to the response to support families arriving from Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_953"> The claims currently being received for ANPs are varied and often quite complex, reflecting the individual circumstances being experienced. Where an application is complete and accompanied by the required documentation, it is generally processed very quickly. Where it is clear that a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure he or she receives a payment on the same day. Any delays are typically due to additional information or documentation being requested from the person and the length of time it takes for the information to be provided. Some claims, by their very nature, are not as urgent and, in these cases, the community welfare officer, CWO, gives greater flexibility to the customers with extended time to respond. Upon receipt of this information, the application will then be processed quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_954"> My Department has taken a number of steps to simplify and streamline the process for persons applying for additional needs payments. There has been a major public information campaign to raise awareness of the payment. A client does not have to attend an office in person to make a claim. If it is more convenient for them, clients can speak directly with a CWO when they call the community welfare service freephone line. People who have never been to a CWO before find this very useful. There is a full-time CWO presence in more than 50 Intreo offices nationwide from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. Of course, in addition, CWOs attend clinics in other locations, deal with people over the phone and, where needed, arrange to visit a person’s homes by appointment. There are 412 people across all grades in the community welfare service.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">I thank the Minister for her response. It is always welcome to see the number of applications approved and being paid out rising. That means that people are seeking support and getting it, which is important. Can the Minister give us any information on the number of applications refused? I had asked that in a parliamentary question but all I got back was the number approved. It is important that we have those data. Data on exceptional needs and urgent needs payments refusals were not previously collected but then started to be collected.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">It is important we have this information as well because we need to make sure that people are getting the support they need. The Minister confirmed last week that 70% of applications are finalised within four weeks. A month is a long time to wait. I do not believe it is fair to put it on all on the individual and say, "Well, they do not send on the full information". Clearly there are issues there. Will the Minister provide an update on staffing? I know that recruitment is under way, which is welcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">I thank the Deputy. I have been in politics for almost 20 years. I have always dealt with local CWOs and to be fair to them they have always done their very best to help people. They give a good service. The delivery of this service is a priority for me and my Department. As of October, more than 75,000 applications for additional needs payments had been processed and awarded. This represents a 63% increase in awarded applications compared to the same period in 2021. As the Deputy will be aware, we had a major communications campaign to raise awareness of the additional needs payment. I believe that campaign has worked. We know this because the numbers applying have increased.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">It is important that the online provision is put up as quickly as possible. I had asked the Minister about it just before the summer recess. Perhaps she will also give us an update on that. It will be helpful for those people who can apply online. At least then they can give all of the information before they submit the application at all. That should help to move things along in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_959"> I take nothing away from CWOs; they do a wonderful job. The problem is that they are not in the community the way they used to be. We cannot all be wrong. Everyone in the Opposition who has a role in social protection has raised issues with the Minister around CWOs, and I have put it to her many times. This has come to me from the local family resource centre. A person in a domestic violence situation cannot have someone come out to the home. The person does not have 15 minutes to wait on the phone or to explain the situation. People in those circumstances need to be able to access the community welfare officer. In the case of my home town, the CWOs used to be in the local health centre. They are not there anymore and that is an issue. Every Member on this side of the House has raised cases with the Minister. We cannot all be wrong. I ask her to look at it again, and to perhaps engage with the CWOs directly on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_960">Where an application is complete and the required documentation is supplied, it is processed quickly. As I have said previously, where there are delays sometimes it is due to additional information or documentation being requested from the person to support their application. My Department has taken a number of steps to simplify and streamline the process for persons who apply for additional needs payments. There is a new national helpline phone number so people can ring up and get advice. A full-time CWO is also present in more than 50 Intreo offices nationwide, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. The CWOs remain available to attend clinics. They can talk to people over the phone where needed, and they can arrange to visit a person's house by appointment. We are genuinely doing everything we can to facilitate and help people. There are many payments. If they are urgent, they are paid out on the same day. I have confirmation that this has happened in instances where it is essential for items such as food, or for things that are so urgent that people do get it on the same day. In fairness to the CWOs, they are doing the best to make sure it is delivered on time.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">I totally agree that the role of the community welfare office is a vital one, so let us all put that to bed. I want to see more of them, and more of them within our communities meeting people face to face. There are 50 Intreo offices but if there are only 50 Intreo offices they can only cover a narrow geographical area. The impediment is that there are not enough community welfare officers interfacing with people on the ground. Is the Minister satisfied that every resident of the State has access, as needs be, to a CWO?</p>

            <p eId="para_963">I am happy to assure the Deputy that every resident in the State, regardless of geography, has access to a community welfare officer in their locality. CWOs are available to facilitate urgent and in-person meetings in more than 50 Intreo centres nationwide, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo centres, branch offices, outreach clinics and Department of Social Protection offices, community welfare officers can make an appointment to meet a person who requests a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home within a short time, usually same day if it is urgent.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> In addition, it is now possible for a client to make a claim, or to make an inquiry about a claim without attending in person if it is more convenient for them. The person can speak directly with a CWO when they call the community welfare service freephone line. This does not reduce the service to people, as their case can be escalated quickly if urgent local action is required such as a need for an immediate cheque payment. Where it is clear a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure they receive a payment that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> Furthermore, a person can make an application for supplementary welfare allowance by completing the SWA1 form, which is widely available. It can be downloaded at <i>www.gov.ie</i>. It is available in all Intreo centres and branch offices. It can also now be requested by email, phone and using the request application form page available on <i>www.gov.ie</i>. The completed application form should be returned to the Department, where it will be processed quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_966"> I want to be very clear that the community welfare service continues to provide local access to local CWOs in local areas right across the country and I have no plans to change this aspect of the service.</p>

            <p eId="para_967">I appreciate the Minister's commitment to service. I welcome the fact that the discretionary nature of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is set out in statute, covers everything from household bills to child-related payments, clothing, funeral expenses and other general expenses, housing expenses, illness expenses and a multitude of other urgent needs payments. I welcome the assurances by the Minister - if I interpret her correctly - that she is going to protect those, and that no element of those that are non-statutory will be taken away. It is vital that the discretionary element of the payments be maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_972"> With regard to staffing, there are 412 people across all grades in the community welfare service. In light of the increased volume of applications, and as part of the budget, we secured agreement for approximately 74 additional staff to be assigned to the community welfare service. Recruitment has commenced for these additional staff. It is anticipated that they will be in place by the first quarter of 2023. In the interim, until the staff have been recruited, 30 social welfare inspectors have been temporarily reassigned to the community welfare service since the start of November to assist with claims processing. While we do not have a full picture until the end of the year, we are starting to see now a falloff in applications for additional needs payments over recent weeks. This can probably be attributed to the lump sum payments that have been paid out.</p>

As someone who represents both an urban and rural constituency, I want to see the traditional, old-style, face-to-face interaction, and I believe that many others share this view. I take the point made by the Minister around the right of people to have access to a person where they can make an appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">If, however, the caseload is 75,000 applications, give or take, per annum, if I interpret the Minister correctly, and if the staff quotient is about 412, the caseload per officer is increasing, and it has become more centralised into hubs. The local discretion is being taken away and the number of officers in more remote areas is decreasing. That is my contention based on my first-hand experience. It is more an observation than a question.</p>

Can the Minister give us a rough timeline for that legislation? Lone parents have waited a long time. These are really important reforms and we really want to see this legislation move as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_980">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_981"> I am pleased to have recently published the report of the child maintenance review group, together with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee. The Government established a child maintenance review group in 2020 to examine a number of issues relating to child maintenance in Ireland and to prepare a report for the Minister for Social Protection on the current treatment of child maintenance payments within the Department of Social Protection; the current provisions relating to the liable relatives regarding child maintenance; and the establishment of a State child maintenance agency. I am delighted that the Government has accepted the group's recommendations on the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_982"> As a result, child maintenance payments will be disregarded in the means test for social welfare payments. As we know, lone parents are a particularly vulnerable group. This measure will mean that many parents currently on reduced rates of payment will see their payments increase. It will also mean that some additional lone parents will qualify for a payment. It is estimated that this measure will be of direct benefit to approximately 16,000 lone parents at a cost of approximately €10 million per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> We will also remove the "efforts to seek maintenance" requirement from the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment. This requirement often involves having to go to court. This change will remove an additional stress for lone parents and will help to reduce the burden on our courts system.</p>
            <p eId="para_984"> In addition, the liable relative provisions will be discontinued. This means that my Department will no longer seek to recoup a portion of claim costs from the non-resident parent. I wish to be very clear that removing these provisions does not replace or supersede the primary responsibility of parents to maintain their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_985"> These are very significant reforms of the social welfare system which will be of great benefit to lone parents. Introducing these changes will require me to make amendments to both primary and secondary legislation. The reforms will also necessitate changes to some of my Department's systems, application forms and processes. My officials are working on advancing these issues at present to ensure as early an implementation as possible of the reforms.</p>
            <p eId="para_986"> Once again, I thank the chair of the child maintenance review group, Judge Catherine Murphy, and all the members of the group for their work on these important and complex issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">I too welcome the publication of the report and commend everybody involved in the group. It is a really important piece of work. However, the cost of removing child maintenance payments from the means test will be €10 million, which is small money, considering the budget of the Department of Social Protection. It is so regrettable we needed this group and this report in the first place. It is fair enough to have a report looking at the possibility of establishing an agency, but it should never, ever have been the case that child maintenance, where it is paid, is treated as household income. We did not need a report or anything complex or convoluted to come to that conclusion. At €10 million, it should have been done a long time ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_988"> I am glad that the "efforts to seek maintenance" requirement is to be removed as it places the obligation on lone parents to seek maintenance through the courts. The Minister herself referred to the additional stress that that causes. If we do not set up an agency or some kind of service, that is stress continued because people will end up in court when they clearly do not want to be there.</p>
            <p eId="para_989"> A majority view of the group was that the child maintenance service or agency be established. Will the Minister give her opinion on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_990">I know that Deputy Kerrane is passionate about this, and we have had many a good and very constructive discussion on it. Senator Ruane is also passionate about this and has done a lot of work on it also. I met her only recently. In fairness, I have always said I recognise the problem that was there. The Deputy has heard me talk about it before when I have spoken about my time working in a credit union and the issues I saw first-hand there. These are significant reforms we are making, and between us Oireachtas Members and the group itself, this is a case of women leading the way.</p>
            <p eId="para_991"> On the question of the establishment of a child maintenance agency, the group did not reach a consensus. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has announced significant reforms to make the family courts system more accessible and family-friendly. We need to see how those reforms bed in. As part of the reforms, the Department of Justice will undertake a review of enforcement of child maintenance orders in the first half of 2023, and proposals for reform will look at strengthening attachment orders, which is the secret to all this, and examining the feasibility of introducing guidelines on child maintenance amounts.</p>

            <p eId="para_992">That is welcome. As I said before, I do not believe that courts are the place for this to be sorted out and determined. We need to keep a really close eye on whatever reforms in respect of the courts come in the new year and into 2023 to make sure they improve the situation. It has been a nightmare and, in some cases, an absolute ordeal for a great many lone parents for many years now, and they deserve an awful lot better. The child maintenance review group said we need urgent and radical reform, so it is really important we see that legislation as early as possible in the new year. It is long overdue, and the Minister will have the support of the House, no doubt, in progressing it.</p>

I want to get the changes made as soon as possible, and administrative issues are being dealt with, specifically the liable relatives and the requirement to prove that the maintenance was sought in going to court. I think we can deal with that fairly quickly, but more work has to be done on the legislative requirements and the impact of the Social Welfare Bill in a number of places. We just want to make sure we get it right. That is the most important thing. I am keen we move as quickly as possible in strengthening the attachment orders. The way I see it is that if you are meant to pay a certain amount for the maintenance of your child, just get on with it and stop this nonsense whereby one week you pay, and then you miss a few payments and come back and make another few, and then there are arrears, and then you go to court, and all that. That is a waste of everybody's time. If you are supposed to pay it, just pay it. That will be the secret of the success here if we can manage to get an attachment order that makes it stick such that payments have to be made and are automatically deducted. I will be working on that in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000"> The Indecon cost of disability report identified that additional costs of disability are a wider issue than income supports and run across a number of areas of government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001"> These include housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines, and additional living expenses. </p>
            <p eId="para_1002"> The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as a person without a disability. There is not a single typical cost of disability; rather, there is a spectrum from low to high additional costs, depending on individual circumstances. </p>
            <p eId="para_1003"> As the findings of the research have implications for so many areas of public policy and extends beyond the remit of the Department, a whole-of-government perspective is needed to address the cost of disability. This is why the Government referred the report to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which Is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for disability. This group comprises of relevant Departments, agencies, a disability stakeholder group and people with disabilities. The group will consider and monitor recommended actions required by the various Departments biannually. </p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> A number of the measures I introduced as part of budget 2023 in support of people with disabilities and their carers address some of the findings of the report and will go towards alleviating some of the costs experienced. These include a combination of lump sums, increases to income disregards and increases in core weekly payment rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> My Department is also committed to developing and consulting on a straw man proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments. A further objective is to simplify the system and remove anomalies. The straw man will be informed by the Indecon cost of disability report.</p>

            <p eId="para_1006">It is important that there be engagement with those organisations on the ground and the report has disabled people to the fore. Can the Minister give us any additional information on the straw man proposal and on whether there is a timeline for that? It is so important. The cost of disability report was published nearly a year ago. It is not the first report to say that a cost of disability payment needs to be introduced. I understand the lump sum payments will make some difference but they relate to the cost of living. They are not to recognise disability as per the cost of disability report unless that is something that the Minister sees continuing on as a cost of disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007"> I assume the other schemes such as disability allowance and invalidity pension will all be part of the straw man proposal. Can the Minister confirm that? The means test in particular causes great difficulty for an awful lot of people living with a disability.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I had a good discussion just a couple of hours ago with the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, and its member organisations at a strategic general meeting. I was speaking to Mr. John Dolan from DFI. There was positive feedback on the €500 disability support grant. There was recognition that we pushed the door ajar within the system by introducing that payment. We need to keep pushing that door open. My Department is working on reform of disability payments. I intend to publish the straw man proposal on these reforms shortly for consultation with the sector and get the views of the advocacy groups. The cost of disability report recommended payments on a tiered basis, for example. There are mild, moderate or profound levels of disability and, therefore, a flat rate is not appropriate. A person with a profound disability who might never be able to work would receive a higher payment than somebody with a mild disability who can. That makes sense. Those are the lines along which I am thinking.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">When the Minister says “reform of disability payments”, what payments is she including in that? Does it include, for example, the blind pension or the invalidity pension? The publication of the straw man proposal is welcome and important. She said it would happen "shortly." I love the word "shortly". Does that mean this side of 2023 or are we talking about the new year?</p>
            <p eId="para_1010"> There is clearly an issue for people who rely on payments such as disability allowance. The latest data on poverty and deprivation published survey on income and living conditions, SILC, relates to 2021. Across the board, at-risk of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty are up. Almost 20% of people with a disability are living in consistent poverty in 2022. That is why it is so important that we get these income supports right for this cohort of people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1011">To be fair, we have done a good deal of work in supporting people with disabilities. The cost of living double payment was paid to people getting disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind pension, disablement benefit and partial capacity benefit. There was a €500 cost-of-living lump sum. The disability support grant was paid to people in receipt of a long-term disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind pension. There was a €200 cost-of-living lump-sum payment for people getting a disability payment and who received a living alone increase. There was a €400 cost-of-living lump sum fuel allowance payment and a Christmas bonus double payment next week to all persons getting a long-term disability payment. The domiciliary care allowance will increase by €20.50 to €330 per month from January 2023. That is the first increase since 2009. From January 2023, there will be an increase of €12 in the maximum personal rate of weekly disability payments. There will be proportionate increases for qualified adults for people getting a reduced rate. The domiciliary care allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six weeks after birth. I spoke to Anna Gunning from Children in Hospital today. She welcomed those changes. Last year, I changed the domiciliary care allowance up to six months. The disablement benefit will be disregarded in the means assessment for fuel allowance from January 2023. There is a €1 million expansion of the reasonable accommodation fund to support people with disabilities in the workplace. That is something I want to focus on. I want to help people with a disability who can work to break down the barriers, whether it is for them or employers, to see how we can get more people back to work in a tight labour market. They have a huge contribution to make. I am keen to focus on that as well. I have increased the earnings disregard for disability allowance and blind pension for people who go back to work from €140 to €165 from the beginning of January 2023. The means assessment threshold for fuel allowance increases from €100 to €200 over the basic contributory pension rate. That means that more people on disability will qualify.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">My Department has no scheme in respect of uillean pipe makers. The legislative provision in the Social Welfare Bill 2022 follows directly on foot of a provision of the Finance Bill 2022, which inserted a new section 216F into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">This new section provides for an exemption from income tax up to €20,000 for certain profits arising from the production, maintenance and repair of certain musical instruments. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide that such exempted income remains assessable when calculating such individuals' reckonable income for social insurance contribution liability purposes. This will ensure the social insurance income liability of the beneficiaries of the section 216F measure remains uninterrupted so they can continue to maintain and build an entitlement to the range of benefits available to them under the social insurance system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021"> Responsibility for taxation matters rests with my colleague, the Minister for Finance. In 2016, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I obtained the approval of the Cabinet to seek special UNESCO recognition for uilleann pipes. That cleared the way for Na Píobairí Uilleann and UCD's National Folklore Collection, and the GAA in respect of hurling, to proceed with their application to UNESCO. I firmly believe UNESCO recognition will provide a significant opportunity to showcase the uniqueness of uilleann piping, hurling and Irish folklore to the world. UNESCO status was granted to uilleann pipes in 2017 and to hurling and camogie in 2018. I realise the Deputy comes from Cork and absolutely understand why he would want hurling included. I take on board his comments. We will have to discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1024">Harping, uilleann piping and hurling are synonymous with Ireland's national identity and have gained the international recognition they so richly deserve. I was genuinely delighted to see in this year's Finance Bill that, following discussions with my colleagues the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the latter made provision for an income tax relief related to the manufacturing, maintenance and repair of sets of uilleann pipes and Irish harps. Under the Finance Bill, the makers of uilleann pipes, the early Irish harp and Irish lever harp will be able to claim an exemption from income tax on profits up to €20,000 in a given year for the production, maintenance and repair of the instruments. Under the Bill, the relief applies to the years 2023, 2024 and 2025. The instruments are made by trained craftspeople. The skills have been handed down by master craftspeople for generations. Under the UN convention, the instruments and craftsmanship required to produce them enjoy UNESCO recognition.</p>

If the Government were of a mind to consider other crafts such as hurley making, it would be very much welcomed. If the Minister wishes to take up the cudgel or the hurl on that, she would have the support of all of us here.</p>

A lot of work was done by the GAA. It put in the application. I believe camogie was included. It is important that we recognise these traditions. The problem with ash dieback is concerning. I will leave it at that. Perhaps the Deputy will submit a question for the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1029">I thank Deputy Moynihan for raising this matter. The main income supports to carers provided by my Department include the carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and carer's support grant. Spending on these in 2022 is expected to be in excess of €1.5 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030"> The carer's benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for someone in need of full-time care and attention. A person may be eligible for the carer's benefit if he or she has sufficient PRSI contributions. The carer's benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for. It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks. This payment is complemented by the Carer's Leave Act 2001, which allows employees to leave their employment temporarily to provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care and attention. A person is entitled to take carer's leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks. It should be noted that not all those claiming the carer's benefit opt to remain in payment for the full 104 weeks. The average duration regarding the benefit was 76.1 weeks between 2018 and 2021. </p>
            <p eId="para_1031"> Where care is provided beyond the period of entitlement to carer's benefit, the means-tested carer's allowance is available for those in need of income support. These arrangements ensure the efficient use of public funds while assisting those who need to take time out for caring and are in need of an income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1032">I thank the Minister for the reply outlining the fact that the average duration is 76.1 weeks. People receiving the carer's benefit are predominantly caring for a relative with a very serious health diagnosis. We constantly come across cases where a partner in a couple has to leave the workforce to provide care to a child full time. Such a person gets the carer's benefit for two years. The benefit was designed in 2001 and has helped an enormous number of families over the years. When the 104 weeks are up, an individual cannot claim any other benefit. I accept the Minister's point on the public purse but there is a case to be made for considering the circumstances of those with considerable care needs. I ask the Minister and Department to investigate whether the benefit can be made available on a long-term basis. The beneficiaries would have paid PRSI. Maybe there could be an extension in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">No more than the Deputy, I meet carers all the time in my constituency office. We help them to fill out the forms and follow up on their applications. The carers do great work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">It is particularly difficult when we see a mother who has had to give up work in order to care for a child full-time. </p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> One of my priorities when I became Minister for Social Protection was to do whatever I could to support our carers because I know well the huge work they do and contribution they make to our society. In my first budget in the Department, I increased the carer's support grant to €1,850, the highest ever level. In last year's budget, I was the first Minister in 14 years to make changes to the carer's means test. Those changes mean the first €50,000 in savings is disregarded and a couple can have weekly earnings of up to €750 and still qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036"> As part of this year's budget, carers got a double payment in October. They will get another double payment next week as part of the Christmas bonus. They also got a special €500 carer's support grant last week. Those three measures alone will put an extra €1,000 in carer's pockets. From January, carers will get a €12 increase in their weekly payment, the largest increase since the mid-2000s.</p>

            <p eId="para_1037">I congratulate the Minister on the change to means-testing, the increase in the payments and what was known as respite care and the €500 payment issues last week. Those measures are very beneficial. Families we deal with are extremely grateful for the funding they have received. This issue comes up constantly at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038"> The 2001 Act introduced carer's benefit for two years. We can only guess why the average is what it is, but everyone has a fair idea of why that is the case. When a partner gives up a full-time position, having paid PRSI from the start of his or her working life, there is a case to be made to examine and perhaps the expand the scheme. I ask the Minister to review the position and determine the cost and how many families would benefit from a change.</p>

We are doing a lot of work to support carers, which is absolutely right because they do wonderful work. I take on board the points the Deputy has made regarding carer's benefit. All benefit payments are time-bound. I will discuss the points he has made with my officials. As Minister for Social Protection, my number one aim is to keep people out of poverty. In order to start to pay carers for the work they do, there needs to be a discussion with the Department of Health on the role played by carers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 128 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044"> Fuel allowance is a means-tested payment to assist pensioners and other low-income households with their winter heating costs. I was very conscious, when addressing my budget priorities for 2023, that many families and older people fall just outside the qualifying threshold for the fuel allowance. It was an absolute priority for me to expand the reach of the scheme. I was, therefore, pleased, as part of the social protection budget 2023 package of €2.2 billion, to announce that I had secured funding for the largest ever expansion of the fuel allowance scheme. It is estimated that the changes introduced will see up to 81,000 additional households qualify for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045"> I was particularly aware of the position of older people and, as part of the budget measures, I announced a new means test for those aged 70 and over which will commence in January 2023. A new weekly means threshold of €500 for a single person and €1,000 for a couple is being introduced and applicants no longer need to be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. I am also increasing the threshold for the capital disregard in the means assessment from €20,000 to €50,000. </p>
            <p eId="para_1046"> The implementation of the over 70s expansion required significant system changes and IT development work. A new streamlined online fuel application process will be available to take applications on <i>mywelfare.ie</i> in early December. This will be the easiest and quickest way to apply for the payment. Those who qualify will have their payments backdated to the week commencing 2 January 2023 or the date of their application if the claim is made after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047"> For applicants aged under 70, the means threshold is being increased by €80 per week, from €120 to €200 above the appropriate weekly rate of the State contributory pension. That means in January the means test will increase to €265 per week for a single person for those aged under 70. In addition, in the week commencing 14 November, a €400 additional lump sum payment was paid to all households in receipt of fuel allowance. </p>
            <p eId="para_1048"> I want to get this up and running as quickly as possible because I do not know about other Deputies but I have a queue of people coming into my office wondering when they can get application forms. I understand they are anxious to get the payment. We have to do a bit of work on it and we want to make it streamlined and easy to follow. It takes some work to get things up online. We will do that as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049"> The basis of this was the over 70s medical card scheme. I modelled this scheme along those lines because I believe that when people are older they are more likely to get sick. That is why the medical card scheme for those aged over 70s was put in place. When people are older they are more likely to be colder, and that is why I wanted to introduce this new benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1050">It is one of the most progressive social protection announcements I have ever seen. It is a very positive move and could not have come at a better time. As we know, people are struggling with the cost of fuel. My office has been inundated with inquiries from people looking for information on this since the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051"> The Minister may recall that in advance of the budget I brought to her attention the case of a woman who worked hard all her life and had reared her family. Due to a small occupational pension, she was above the threshold for the fuel allowance. She will now qualify under the new threshold, which is very important to her and gives her huge security. </p>
            <p eId="para_1052"> Based on the figures provided by the Minister, about 3,000 households in my constituency of Kerry will benefit from the scheme. That is an enormous number of people. It will provide people who are fearful in the current crisis of not being able to stay warm during the winter with great security. I thank the Minister and congratulate her on her efforts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1054">As I said, during the budget one of the measures I was keen to prioritise was an expansion of the fuel allowance for older people. Both Deputies Carey and Griffin raised those issues with me. They said that a lot of pensioners do not qualify for the fuel allowance. I listen to what is said across the House, not just on one side. The evidence is there that older people are more vulnerable to the cold. The one thing I do not want to see as a Minister is a situation where an old person is afraid to turn on the heat. We all have parents and grandparents and none of us wants to see them sitting in the cold saying they cannot turn the heat on. That is why I brought in this completely new means test for those who are over 70. As Deputies know, a single person can have an income of €500 and a couple can have an income of €1,000 under the scheme. There is another important point that I want to explain. A lot of people did not get the fuel allowance because they were not in receipt of a social welfare payment to qualify for it. That particularly affected civil servants because they did not get a social welfare payment so we are changing that. That means low-paid civil servants will qualify.</p>

            <p eId="para_1055">That is an important inclusion and that is helpful to many people. I welcome the efforts that have been made to help cope with what will effectively be an avalanche of applications, with talk of 80,000 applications. I hope the systems are up to scratch. Should there be delays it is reassuring to know that any application will be backdated to 2 January. That is important to try to give reassurance to people who may otherwise be afraid to turn on the heating or put the extra few lumps of coal on the fire. Even if their applications are not processed rapidly they will be backdated. That is welcome and I thank the Minister for clarifying that here. I ask that as much information as possible would be communicated offline and through mainstream media to the target audience between now and the opening of the scheme because people are keen for news on it. I ask that there are offline facilities to assist people with the application process. It would be important to provide that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister on this initiative, which will make a massive difference. Both of my colleagues have alluded to the need for information so that people know about this. It would be a shame if people did not know about it and missed it. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that some of the citizens information outreach centres have still not opened since the pandemic. The Minister might ask her officials to have a look at this and to make sure the citizens information outreach centres are open, where they were prior to the pandemic, across the country. This will mean that people, including those who are not used to online applications, can go in, sit down and get the information, support and help they need to make the application for this fantastic scheme and for other schemes that the Minister has brought in during her time.</p>

Like previous speakers, information will be critical because I have been inundated with phone calls and people calling into the office. People are also going to social welfare offices for information. It is so important that elderly people get this and a lot of them do not do online applications. When it comes to the social welfare offices, has the Minister thought about recruiting extra personnel for a few months? They may be needed in January or even in December. People have contacted me and they are delighted with this but extra personnel could be important for the social welfare offices. As the Minister said, the staff there work so hard but their phones are constantly ringing and people are looking for information. How can we get the information out as quickly as possible? Is the Minister looking at recruiting more staff until we get the bulk of the applications processed? This is a welcome move for the 80,000 people who need this assistance most; they are the most vulnerable.</p>

We will have an online form out before Christmas. We will have it out as soon as we can. We are working on it and the officials have been working long hours to design it because you have to be careful with anything that goes online. There will be a paper form in due course but speed is of the essence. I am sure there will be plenty of young people around over Christmas and if their elderly relatives are stuck with the online form then the young people will be good in making the applications for their grandparents if necessary. We will have a paper-based application but the online one is coming up first because we want to try to do this as quickly as possible. The good news is that when you get your application in, it will be backdated to 1 January.

            <p eId="para_1062">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Illness benefit is the primary short-term income support provided by my Department to those who are unable to work due to illness of any type and who are covered by social insurance. Eligibility for illness benefit depends on the person’s PRSI record and class. People must have made the required number of contributions in class A, E, H or P to qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063"> In general, self-employed people make PRSI contributions at class S, which does not count towards eligibility for illness benefit. I am not considering changing this rule. However, self-employed contributors who cannot work due to an illness or a disability may apply for disability allowance, a means-tested social assistance payment, or invalidity pension, a social insurance payment. Illness benefit is funded by the Social Insurance Fund through PRSI contributions. The fund is central to our social protection system and the Government needs to ensure that it can provide adequate and sustainable social insurance pensions and benefits for a growing and aging population. Self-employed people pay contributions to the fund at a lower rate of 4%. This is 11% lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors. However, self-employed contributors have access to over 90% of benefits available to employed contributors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064"> These include: adoptive benefit; guardian's contributory payment; invalidity pension; jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed; maternity benefit; parent's benefit; partial capacity benefit where in receipt of invalidity pension; paternity benefit; the State contributory pension; treatment benefit; and widows, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension. The only benefits that class S PRSI do not provide access to are carer's benefit, health and safety benefit, illness benefit, and occupational injuries benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_1065">I thank the Minister for her clear answer. She has made the point well. Since the introduction of the changes the Minister and others in the Department have made on the class S contributions being applicable to the invalidity pension, how many self-employed people have benefited and been able to get the invalidity pension? The difficulty for self-employed people is there is no mechanism for them to secure the job if they have a permanent illness. It might be interesting for us to have the figures on how many people qualified for the invalidity pension from the S class contributions since the changes were made by the Minister and others in the Department.</p>

I remember when self-employed people got nothing. We have made a lot of progress in that regard. They now receive more than 90% of the other benefits when they pay their PRSI. They pay 4% in total, which is fair enough, but if we are to give them more benefits, we will have to have a conversation about increasing PRSI. I want to be straight about that. There is no point in looking at it other than as part of a conversation on increased rates of PRSI.</p>

            <p eId="para_1073">The introduction of a pensions auto-enrolment system is a programme for Government commitment and a key priority for me as Minister for Social Protection. As the Deputy will know, under auto-enrolment, employees will have access to a workplace pension savings scheme, co-funded by their employer and the State. For every €3 workers pay into it, they will have another €4 credited to their account, and the contributions will then be invested. The additional €4 consists of €3 from the employer and €1 from the State. This will be supplementary to the State pension and will be of particular benefit to the estimated 65% of people working in the private sector who are not currently paying into a supplementary pension scheme. That is estimated at approximately 750,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074"> In March last, following Cabinet approval, I published the document, The Design Principles for Ireland's Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings System, which sets out in detail what the new system will do and who will be able to access it. It is envisaged that the enrolment of the first auto-enrolment participants will commence in early 2024. Working towards that date, the focus is now solely on implementing the agreed design, including by drafting the necessary legislation that will underpin it, designing the organisation structures and the technical system to operate it, and communicating this landmark reform to stakeholders and the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075"> To this end, the general scheme for a Bill establishing the auto-enrolment system was developed, brought to Government and approved in July. The Bill is now being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope I will be in a position to publish it early next year. I have also submitted the general scheme of the heads of the Bill to the Oireachtas joint committee and I am told the committee has commenced pre-legislative scrutiny and called for submissions from relevant stakeholders. I look forward to the committee's report and to engaging with the Oireachtas in a debate on the Bill in early 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_1076">I thank the Minister for all the work she and her officials have been doing on the system. The system is very progressive, important and welcome. Does the Minister have any idea of the initial cost to the State, year on year, when the system will be introduced in 2024, and in 2025, 2026 and so on? Has any work been done on that yet? Perhaps it is premature for the Minister to know that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077"> Of the 65% or 750,000 people who have no private pension at the moment, can they opt in to the system as it develops or does it only apply to people when they start a new job and only from the very beginning?</p>

Anybody who does not have a private occupational pension will be automatically enrolled. People are joined up and there are breaks allowed for different reasons. I do not have all the information in my head as it is getting late, but a person can opt out for a period, such as six months. We will put people back in again and we will keep putting them in. As Deputy Stanton will appreciate, and I know myself, there is never a right time to start a pension. When we start off, we want to have money to enjoy ourselves. Then when we have children, we must look after them and then we have to educate them. There is never a right time, but we are going to start this now.</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">It has been raised with me that some people may have personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs. The exemption of participants and employers from auto-enrolment based on their engagement with existing occupational pension schemes and PRSAs will likely be based on minimum requirement standards. My officials are currently working out the detail of how this will work for the purposes of the legislation, and in terms of the automation of the system. My understanding and preference is that no participant should be in an occupational or supplementary pension scheme that leaves him or her less well off than he or she would be under auto-enrolment. We have to work on those details as the legislation is being drafted. I have the design in place and it has gone to the Oireachtas joint committee. If the committee has some suggestions, I will be happy to hear them. If I can make the system even better, I will be happy to do that as well. It has started now, which is the most important point.

            <p eId="para_1084">My Department is aware of reports that people have received scam calls purporting to be from departmental officials. Thankfully, there has been a significant decline in the reported instances, from more than 1,500 last year to fewer than 120 this year. These scam phone calls and text messages are seeking personal information, for example, a PPS number and bank account details. The focus of the Department's response has been on the provision of information to the public so that people are aware that these calls are fraudulent and that the Department would not contact a customer to ask for these personal details by phone or text.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085"> The Department has been in contact with An Garda Síochána in relation to these scams. In 2021, when the scam calls first came to our attention, the Department alerted people via a number of channels, including a video message from me, which was published on social media; a press release; internal communications to the Department's staff; a multilingual notification on our website; and a public information campaign, which ran in May 2021.</p>

I take this opportunity to urge customers of my Department, who have accounts with KBC or Ulster Bank to update their payment details through the secure change of payment service on <i>mywelfare.ie</i>. This service is available to customers with a verified MyGovID account. Customers can also provide their new bank account details in writing to the relevant scheme area in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">My Department will never contact a customer by phone or text message and ask for bank details.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">I thank the Minister for her response and for the work she and her officials are doing in this area, which is very serious, especially given, as she told us, there were 1,500 such calls last year. I wonder how many of them caused damage to people and managed to defraud them, although she might not have that information to hand. I welcome the fact that, as she noted, the figure has fallen to 100 this year, which shows that progress has been made and that the work she and her officials are doing is bearing fruit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089"> Has anybody been prosecuted as a result of making these scam calls and sending these scam text messages? I urge the Minister to continue to inform people of the danger of these scams and to remind them they should not give out information. I again highlight the importance of Citizens Information being made available as much as possible, even on a personal basis in towns and villages, and I reiterate that the outreach centres are very important in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1090">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter because it is very important. Unfortunately, we will all know stories of people who have received text messages that drew them into a link that turned out to be fake and a scam. I urge people not to give their bank details to anybody, and the same is true of social protection. People should not give out their PPS number; the Department will not call people looking for that sort of information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091"> The Department is very proactive in this space, and flashes and alerts warn people about what they should not do. This conversation will highlight the fact people need to be aware. Crime has changed, unfortunately. Years ago, someone might have had her handbag stolen and that was the way it was done, whereas now criminals can steal from people through their phone, so we need to be so careful.</p>

            <p eId="para_1092">I fully agree with the Minister that this is very important. I suggest she might ask, if it has not been done, that notices be placed in post offices, where people collect their pensions and other payments, outlining the risk. Sometimes people receive messages and they are not sure about whether they should respond. Most people are well-meaning and good-natured and want to be polite when they get a phone call or message, but we have to emphasise that not everybody at the other end of the phone always has their best interests in mind. Perhaps there could be another number they could call to verify the number if they are unsure about the source of a message they have received. These people can be very clever, manipulative and smart when they talk to people on the phone, and people as clever as the Minister have been caught out by some of this activity.</p>

That is the bottom line. We will continue to raise awareness about the issue. On Black Friday, there was a lot of online activity and many more of these criminals may have been trying to tap into vulnerable people. I would be happy for post offices to put up notices. I am sure we have provided them as well and we are happy to do that to create that awareness.</p>

            <p eId="para_1097">This question relates to a programme that I know is as close to the Minister's heart as it is to mine, namely, the school meals programme. As we all know, the cost of putting food on the table has been escalating for everybody in society. In that context, is the subvention available to school meals providers sufficient in view of the inflation in food costs across the board?</p>

            <p eId="para_1098">The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food services to 1,600 schools and organisations benefiting 260,000 children. The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children to position them to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and greater educational achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099"> Budget 2022 provided €68.1 million for the programme, with an additional €9 million provided to allow access to all new Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools from September 2022. Additional funding for the programme has been provided for 2023, bringing the total to €91.6 million. This represents a 49% funding increase in the period since 2020. Funding under the school meals programme can be provided for breakfast, snacks, cold lunch, dinner, hot school meals and after-school clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100"> In March 2022, the Minister for Education announced an extension of DEIS status to an additional 320 schools from September 2022. In July, I announced that from September, access to the hot school meal option would be extended to the 282 newly designated DEIS primary schools, and the cold lunch option to the 38 newly designated DEIS secondary schools, benefiting some 60,000 children. This means that, since my appointment as Minister for Social Protection, I have increased the number of schools with access to the hot school meal option from 37 to more than 500.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101"> I am committed to continuing to expand the school meals programme and building further on the significant extension of the programme in recent years.</p>

I feel strongly, as a former primary school teacher, that when children are in front of us, we should feed them well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103"> The prepared reply the Minister gave me was detailed in some respects but did not go to the heart of the question in others, so before coming to the Chamber I researched on the Department's website the rates that are available. A sum of €2.90 is what is being made available for a hot meal. I understand the economies of scale and so on, whereby it will be cheaper for schools to feed the masses rather than a family feeding four or five at the dinner table, but is that enough for a high-quality, nutritious meal? The figure for breakfast jumped out at me as well, with 60 cent being provided. I am not sure I could put a nutritious breakfast on my table at home for 60 cent. Are we spending enough per meal to ensure we are getting good nutrition into these kids?</p>

            <p eId="para_1104">The Minister of State and I are fully committed to the school meals programme. The evaluation is being carried out, and if it recommends an increase in the rates, I will fully support that. If we are going to give children a good, hot dinner in the middle of the day - nothing can beat that - my aim, and I am sure that of the Deputy, is that every child in this country, regardless of his or her socioeconomic background, should get that hot school meal. It makes such a difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105"> I am happy to examine the rates but I will have to wait for the outcome of the evaluation programme. I have heard a number of the suppliers say they cannot provide the meals at the rate they are getting, but the process is at an advanced stage and I want to await the outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_1106">I thank the Minister. It would be dangerous for me to tell a Monaghan woman how to spend money wisely, but we do not want to be pennywise and pound-foolish here. Our nation's children are the most precious thing we have, and we want to ensure we get a good meal into them. We have started in the correct place, namely, in disadvantaged communities and in DEIS schools, but like the Minister, I would like to see that rolled out throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">I certainly know that both myself and my missus would be very glad not to have to deal with the bloody lunch boxes every day, which would be another attendant benefit. I fully support that ultimate goal but, as I said, I want to make sure that when the State has the children, we feed them but make sure we feed them well. Let us make sure that we are not just penny-pinching and achieve what I think this programme really can achieve.</p>

The Deputy was a teacher and, therefore, he knows first-hand the benefit of feeding children when they are at school. It helps their educational attainment. For those parents who are trying to come up with lunches children might eat, it makes it an awful lot easier if they get their lunch at school, particularly a hot one. I visited a school not that long ago in which there were different menus with different choices for children for the hot school meal. This is particularly relevant to primary schools. I do not know how many times I have pulled blue mould-covered sandwiches out from the bottom of a bag on a Friday evening. It does not matter how nice they are made; the children still manage to not eat them. That is why I am totally committed to this programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1112"> A constituent came to me a couple of weeks ago who was looking specifically for a clothing allowance. I sent the form in to see whether I would get a response on it. The guidance states that the "Additional Needs Payment is a payment to help you with an expense that you cannot pay from your weekly income." It goes on to state that this is for, "Food, clothing and shelter after an emergency event such as a fire or flood."</p>

            <p eId="para_1113">I thank the Deputy. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department may make an additional needs payment to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from his or her weekly income. Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme. These can and do include support to assist people with clothing costs outside of emergency situations where they are unable to meet this need from their own resources. This approach provides targeted support rather than a general clothing allowance. The community welfare officer will consider all the relevant circumstances of the case to help those most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114"> From January to end of September 2022, more than 27,000 additional needs payments with a combined value of more than €3.9 million were made to help people with the cost of clothing. The majority of these payments were made to those arriving from Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115"> My Department also provides a back to school clothing and footwear allowance to eligible families to assist with the cost of clothing and footwear when children return to school each autumn. This year, the allowance was increased by a further €100 for each eligible child under the scheme. The total amount paid for each qualified child aged from four to 11 was €260 and the rate payable for each eligible child aged 12 and over was €385. More than 157,000 families have benefited from this measure in 2022, providing assistance with the cost of clothing and footwear to almost 273,000 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116"> I do not consider that there is a need to introduce a specific clothing allowance given the supports already provided to assist with meeting the current cost-of-living challenges, and access to the additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117"> I encourage any person who considers that they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment to contact their local community welfare service for assistance. There is a national community welfare contact centre in place that will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1118">I thank the Minister. The information on the additional needs payment gives a list of who can get the payment. The guidance states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1119">You can get the Additional Needs Payment to help you with an expense that you cannot pay from your weekly income. For example:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1120">- An increase in your fuel or electricity costs</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1121">- Essential repairs to property, including motor vehicles ... </p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1122">- Funeral costs</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1123">- Deposits for private rented accommodation</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1124">- Bedding and cooking utensils, if you are setting up home for the first time</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1125">- Food, clothing and shelter after an emergency event such as a fire or flood</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1126">- Recurring travel costs to hospital</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1127">- Visiting a relative in hospital or prison</p>
            <p eId="para_1128"> That confuses people. They say they cannot apply for a specific clothing allowance under those criteria. That is why I am raising the issue. It should also be specifically for a clothing allowance and specifically with regard to the cost of living. It is definitely something that should be looked at from that point of view. If a person can apply for it and not have to go to a CWO, it would be better for that person to be able to apply for it officially through those channels. I know the Minister said there is a little discretion but I still think that people are very confused when reading that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1133">I want to raise the issue of the number of psychologists on the north Tipperary children's disability network team, CDNT. I recently received a response to a parliamentary question I submitted to the Minister for Health in which I was informed that there are currently seven whole-time equivalent psychology posts in the area. Following further inquiries, however, I came to learn that two of these posts are currently unfilled. As things stand in north Tipperary, we have two senior psychology posts and two staff grade psychology posts filled, two vacant staff grade psychology posts and one psychology post that has been filled. Furthermore, the north Tipperary CDNT currently has a caseload of 1,473 children, 339 of whom are on waiting lists for supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134"> North Tipperary also has 42 children requiring an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment. Until this assessment is carried out, it is next to impossible for parents to get the supports and early intervention and help they need for their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135"> The HSE was unable to tell me how many additional psychology posts will be necessary in the north of my county to clear the waiting list of 339 children as it currently stands. The HSE was also unable to tell me the caseload figure for each psychologist in the area as the number of clients requiring psychology input changes on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136"> I have serious concerns that the HSE is failing to fill these two vacant posts, one of which has been vacant since March 2022. As long as these posts remain vacant, the waiting lists will continue to grow and families and young people will be left without the intervention supports and attention they need and deserve. The psychologists in the filled posts are doing their best. I am by no means criticising their work but they are under too much pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">They are being assigned too great a workload and those in need are not being seen in a timely manner to get the assistance and the interventions they need at a young age. From speaking to numerous families affected by this across north Tipperary, I know there is a deep cause of frustration and concern from a very significant number of people. Particularly when one looks across county boundaries or even parish boundaries, where other areas are served by a better service under a different healthcare region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138"> I see in Tipperary that there is a divide between the north and south in disability services for children as the county falls into separate healthcare regions. A person's Eircode should not determine the level of care they get. A parent certainly should not have to see their child waiting and not progressing in life as they should, while they wait for these essential services and while children in other areas are receiving interventions much sooner. That is unfortunately the case for early intervention services all too often in north Tipperary. The postcode lottery needs to be tackled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139"> With 339 children on waiting lists in north Tipperary and with a team of five whole-time equivalent psychology positions expected to cover this workload, this is only going to see this issue exacerbated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140"> What plans does the HSE have to tackle the growing waiting lists in north Tipperary for children's disability network team supports? When will the vacant positions be filled? How long will it take to clear the backlog of patients waiting for appointments with psychologists? Why has the HSE failed to fill these two vacant positions to date? If it is a case of additional remuneration required to fill these positions, or better administrative supports so that the psychologists can be freed up to do their jobs to the best of their abilities, then packages need to be put in place. The children of north Tipperary need better, more efficient, and more reliable supports in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1141">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to discuss it in the House this evening. He raised some very valuable questions in his contribution. As Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, I recognise and acknowledge that the Progressing Disability Services, PDS, programme has been challenging for many stakeholders, but especially so for families, the children, and the young people using the service. It is also important to acknowledge the challenges that are there for staff because they are working under tremendous pressure. These challenges have resulted in unacceptably long delays for families to access much needed therapies for their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142"> As Minister of State, I once again want to put on the record my sincerest apologies to any family experiencing such delays. Prior to the introduction of the PDS programme, children in different parts of the country with the same needs could be given much more, or, much less service, based on geography rather than need. This was clearly unfair and needed to change. The core principle of PDS is to achieve fairer and more equitable access to services for all children with disabilities, based on their needs, and not where they happen to live.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143"> Regrettably since PDS was rolled out, there has been a levelling down of services to children and families. As I said previously in this House, the reconfiguration of children's disability network teams, CDNTs, by the HSE across the country has faced particular challenges with regard to recruitment. There is currently an average vacancy rate of 28% across the 91 CDNTs, which equates to approximately 524 vacancies out of a total allocation of 1,892 staff members. Notwithstanding these challenges, it is important to acknowledge the significant work involved in establishing the CDNTs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144"> Approximately 35,000 children are currently receiving services and supports provided by these teams. The underlying vacancy rate in CDNTs is not because of a lack of Government resources. In that regard, I have secured funding for the HSE for additional posts in recent years to strengthen the capacity of CDNTs to ensure services can be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145"> I take on board what the Deputy is saying in respect of the remuneration to retain the staff, where if a person has been there for a certain number of years, he or she should be moved to a senior post, so that we can at least backfill into the more junior grades in order to retain that skill set. That it is there. I am very clear in my saying that to the HSE. We need to flush through our panels to ensure we fill as many posts as possible between now and the end of the year and the start of January. Where do not fill them, we need to ensure our senior posts are protected. If people have worked on those teams for a number of years, those staff members need to be given the opportunity to apply for positions, so that at least we have a senior clinical grade on the team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146"> There are two senior posts, which the Deputy outlined. There are two staff grade posts that are filled and a psychology assistant post that is filled. Currently, there are two vacant staff grade posts that, despite repeated efforts, the CDNTs have been unable to fill. It is regrettable that one of these posts has been vacant since March 2022, and the other since May 2022. The challenge to recruit staff grade psychologists is echoed across the mid-west and nationally. Even in CHO 2 in Mayo, where there are three CDNTs, it does not have one psychologist between the three teams. We need to look at a far more agile approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147"> The proposal, which from the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, is a very good way of remunerating people and giving them the opportunity while they learn their skill to have clinical oversight and perhaps giving us the opportunity to retain them for the four or five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148"> Perhaps if I had not had a more challenging budget, this would have been one of the priorities I would have ensured happened. The two other Deputies in the House are from CHO 4 which this year adopted that exact model in regard to four positions because it was failing to recruit. This is something that needs to be mirrored right across the country. I will deal with the rest of the Deputy's questions in my next response.</p>

            <p eId="para_1149">I thank the Minister of State and I acknowledge her efforts in the area of disability. I also acknowledge the work the staff are doing. No staff working in this service want to see waiting lists. When parents who are waiting for an assessment and services for their child ring me, their frustration is so palpable. They very much feel they are letting down their child and not giving them the best opportunity to fulfil his or her potential. That is regrettable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150"> The figure in the Minister of State's reply that nationally 28% of posts are not filled is very worrying and serious. We have a critical problem here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151"> The Minister of State referred to the fact that recruiting staff is one thing but retention is another. If the remuneration package is not at a level that is needed to ensure retention of staff in the future, it must be looked at as a matter of priority. We cannot let these young children and parents down. Whatever extra resources the service needs to ensure we recruit and retain staff in these positions have to be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152"> In my county, we have a problem in the north of it. The south of the county is far better served. That brings its own frustration as people see, as I said in my original contribution, that it is their postcode which is resulting in a lack of services. That is very frustrating for parents. I acknowledge the efforts being made but I urge the Minister of State to use her persuasive powers, which are very strong, with the HSE to ensure the remuneration packages in place allow for the retention of staff when we fill posts and that we try to fill those posts as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_1153">I thank the Deputy. I reassure him and the House that the HSE continues to explore a range of options. The targeted national and international recruitment for CDNTs is what I am talking about in terms of the end of the year. There is the sponsorship and the apprenticeship programme, the targeted international recruitment, with an agreed reallocation allowance, a sponsorship programme for therapy grades, an apprenticeship programme for therapy grades, employment of graduates as therapist assistants as they await their CORU registration, and an expansion of the therapy assistants in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154"> Only this week I met with Mr. Maurice Hoare from CHO 3. Believe it or not, while north Tipperary is an outlier in CHO 3, the vacancy rate in CHO 3 in children's disabilities is the lowest in the country at 10%. That is poor comfort for the people for north Tipperary but that is what it is. When I look across the border to CHO 5, its vacancy rates in some of its teams are at 54%. When I look to Kells in CHO 8, it has a vacancy level of 60%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155"> Talking and scoping are no longer acceptable within the HSE. Exploring has to be a thing of the past. Action is required as the funding is now there. Having that recruitment campaign is one thing, but it can only be measured on what can be converted into a person delivering a service. I again implore the HSE to be agile and pragmatic with the funding it has and to use it to attract people to disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">I say again that retention has to be our key objective in disabilities. By not having retention, the gap gets wider. The lists in other primary cares and mental health are driving down while in disabilities, they are going in the wrong direction.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T22:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1157">I thank the Minister of State for being here to respond to this topic, which is something I feel strongly about. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with all due respect to the Minister of State, I did not receive notice that the housing Minister would not be here but that is something you might come back to me on, please, at some stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158"> The issue I raise has to do with clubs, organisations and communities trying to find land for football, hurling, camogie, running or whatever activity it is. Across the country there is a problem with that. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and the Government on what is happening with sports capital funding. The amount of money made available in the last tranche is fantastic and I hope that continues into the next tranche. We have the economy going well to make that happen. The Minister of State said to me recently in the House:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1159">There is an issue in certain parts of the country concerning land. Through the development plan process, it is incumbent on local authorities to ensure land is allocated for recreational use. Many local authorities are doing that. </p>
            <p eId="para_1160">He said the role of his Department is "to facilitate grassroots and local authority applications to fund specific projects. As a Department, [they] are not presently in the space of purchasing land or owning a significant land bank...". We have a situation where it falls back to volunteers to find and purchase the land, make sure it is zoned properly and that planning is on it. That is an awful lot of stress and pressure on volunteers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161"> I am sure the Minister of State and Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree that sport, recreation and such activities are vital for young people, and maybe people who are not so young as well. Young people's involvement in sport develops physical and mental fitness and builds community. They learn how to win and lose and we have many policies around sport. The one thing we do not have at national level is a clear direction to local authorities to zone land and make it available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162"> We also have the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. I put down a question to the Minister for Finance about NAMA and he said the agency can facilitate the sale of properties for social purposes where it is commercially practical to do so. We are back again to local volunteers having to raise money to purchase land, and land is in short supply. I had the idea that we could mandate NAMA to make land available in communities where it is properly located.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163"> Deputy Sherlock will be aware of Kilworth and what has been done up there. They have football, hurling, soccer and the whole lot together in one area at the edge of a village. Everyone can walk there and get involved. In my town of Midleton, we are trying to find land for a running track but without success. They are now talking about building 2,500 units on the edge of the town and no recreational facilities are available for that kind of activity. The GAA in our town had to raise a lot of money to build its own facilities. We have hundreds of young people who want to take part but they cannot do so. It is the same with swimming facilities, as I highlighted in the House recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164"> We need a strong, coherent policy from central government. For mental and physical health, this would be a win-win situation. It builds communities and helps everybody in the long term. I was Minister of State in the Department of Justice for a while and dealt with youth justice. I can say strongly that nothing works better than having facilities for sport and activities for young people to keep them away from trouble, bother and all the ills and attractions out there. I implore the Minister of State to go back to her colleagues and develop a national policy whereby we direct the local authorities to make sure land is available for these kind of activities.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T22:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1165">I thank the Deputy for his question on the need to make land available to sporting clubs and organisations for the development of sporting and community facilities in villages, towns and cities. I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166"> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage continues to support the enhancement of amenities in cities, towns and villages and there have been important policy developments in recent years, as well as considerable funding secured for such enhancements. There are also important planning principles that inform the provision of such spaces. Section 67 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides that "a local authority may take such measures, engage in such activities or do such things (including the incurring of expenditure) as it considers necessary or desirable to promote the interests of the local community", including in relation to sports, games and other such activities. Schedule 13 of that Act identifies that such measures taken, activities engaged in or things done by local authorities shall include "the provision (both indoor and outdoor) of playing fields, athletic tracks, swimming pools and other bathing places, sports centres, gymnasia and other facilities and the holding of sporting events". The reservation of lands for recreational and amenity purposes is a matter to be addressed as part of the review of a city or county development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167"> The Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, requires that a development plan include objectives for the zoning of land for use solely or primarily for particular purposes, including for recreational and open space purposes, to such an extent as the proper planning and sustainable development of the area requires. The requirement to make land available for public use is also addressed within guidelines, as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168"> The development plan guidelines for planning authorities highlight the role of the city or county development plan in the provision of public open space. It is recommended that the development plan incorporate a public open space strategy that addresses open space provision as part of a wider assessment of community facilities and amenities. It is envisaged that the development would take a strategic view, including identifying any need for local, town or regional parks, with local area plans and other strategies providing greater detail. The guidelines recommend that when making zoning decisions, consideration must be given to the open space required to serve the community, and that lands should be zoned accordingly. The guidelines also note that the development plan can support a structured approach to open space provision within new developments by including requirements and standards to be applied through the planning process, noting the distinction between open space that is required to serve an individual development and that required to serve the community more broadly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169"> The local area plan guidelines of 2013 state that there should be an emphasis on providing conveniently located neighbourhood facilities commensurate with the projected population for a local area, including play areas. Public open spaces should be easily reached and take biodiversity issues into account in their design.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170"> The sustainable residential development in urban areas guidelines of 2009 state, in section 4.16, that the provision of public open spaces at district and local level will be guided by city or county wide policies. In new development areas, local area plans should identify the preferred location of larger open spaces, including locations in adjoining non-development areas that may accommodate playing pitches and larger recreational facilities. A more flexible approach is envisaged in housing schemes, with spaces suitable for smaller children's play, informal kick-about and passive amenity. Further detail in this regard is provided within the urban design manual, which supplements the guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171"> Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments 2020, in section 4.13, states that the recreational needs of children must be considered as part of communal amenity space within the apartment scheme. The apartment guidelines also provide further details with regard to the forms and location of such facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172"> The guidelines I have cited are issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities must have regard to the guidelines when carrying out their strategic planning or development management functions. This means that planning authorities are required to demonstrate how the policies and objectives of the guidelines have been applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173"> It should be noted that the Department is working towards developing detailed guidelines in relation to sustainable settlements, which will incorporate elements of the 2009 guidelines. It is intended that the proposed sustainable and compact settlement guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Act and will seek to address key issues in relation to the design of open space, which provides a range of active and passive spaces to support the development of amenable neighbourhoods that promote high quality of life for residents.</p>

            <p eId="para_1174">I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive and well put-together response. I will pick one or two things out of it. Her written response states that a "local authority may take such measures" and, subsequently, that the "local authority shall include" provision of both indoor and outdoor playing pitches and so on. When this does not happen, who pulls the local authority up on it and says it should do it? Is it is the Planning Regulator or the Minister? Is there any recourse when it does not happen?</p>
            <p eId="para_1175"> I draw the Minister of State's attention to today’s<i> Irish Examiner</i>. The editorial refers to the National Building Agency, a semi-State body set up to build a lot of houses quickly. It did that but ended up with developments in certain areas that did not have services such as shops, playgrounds or sports facilities, which can bind communities and help them develop. Many of these areas had social problems afterwards because there was nowhere for the children to play.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">I am all for having open spaces, parks and green areas, but we also need sporting and community facilities where organised events such as running, swimming, various field games, indoor games and so on can take place. Some areas in the country have no community hall, for instance. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is doing some work on that at the moment. It falls back on the local community and local volunteers to provide these.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177"> Community work is quite advanced in Mayo. I call on the Government to discuss this with all local authorities to ensure that in places where there are no community facilities, land is zoned to make it happen. It can also happen through NAMA. Otherwise, we are stirring up trouble for the future leaving young people with nothing to do and all day to do it. When I was Minister of State, I visited some communities that were in chaos because they did not have any facilities. The volunteers and local people were crying out for them. I am doing that again this evening. I hope the Minister of State and the Government will listen.</p>

            <p eId="para_1178">I will raise those specific comments with the Minister. It is clear to me and to Government that having amenities and supporting community and social infrastructure are critical to planning for sustainable communities. The provision of sufficient sporting, play and cultural spaces in our towns and cities for the residents of a neighbourhood provides significant social dividend in terms of community engagement and public health. This is recognised in Government policy, such as Town Centre First, and the national planning framework and in the publication in June of Development Plans - Guidelines for Planning Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179"> It is the Minister's intention that the sustainable and compact settlement guidelines currently being developed will support the provision of these amenities by setting out core principles of design and place-making to be applied to create places of high quality at the level of district or neighbourhood, housing schemes and individual well-being.</p>

            <p eId="para_1180">The union SIPTU has brought to our attention a notice of strike action at Zenith Energy Bantry Bay Terminal Limited. That strike is to take place on Tuesday, 13 December. The Whiddy Island terminal has 17 oil storage tanks with a capacity of almost 9 million barrels and stores a significant portion of the State's oil reserves. It is a key reference site nationally. The National Oil Reserve Agency, NORA, is the State body with responsibility for maintaining our strategic supplies of oil and is one of the Whiddy terminal's largest customers. Whiddy Island was originally built in the late 1960s by Gulf Oil to accommodate ultra large crude oil-carrying vessels. We all remember the tragic accident where 51 people died in January 1979 when the oil tanker <i>Betelgeuse</i> exploded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181"> In July 2001, the business and commercial assets of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, were sold to Tosco corporation, now Conoco Phillips, and NORA did not form part of that transaction. Tosco was later acquired by Phillips 66. NORA was established as an independent statutory body in 2007 upon the introduction of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act. The Whiddy terminal was then sold to Zenith in 2015. In 2020, there were reports that Zenith intended to sell the strategic facility. At the time up to 50 staff were employed at the facility in January 2020, but no sale occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182"> I will quote directly from the statement issued by SIPTU. Willie Noone, the sector organiser, stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1183">A ballot for strike action was supported unanimously by our members and is scheduled to commence at 8.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 13th December. This action results from the decision of the company [Zenith] to dismiss workers with long service on Wednesday, 30th November, while planning to employ contractors on an ongoing basis to do their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184"> The union, and the workers to their credit, see this as a last resort. The company is seeking compulsory redundancies. Efforts by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to resolve the dispute were unsuccessful as the company remains insistent that contractors be used to cover the work previously done by the workers being made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185"> I am asking for the Government to intervene on the basis that Zenith is housed within a key reference site that ensures the security of energy supply of the State. I call on the Government to intervene now with Zenith to at least bring the company to a hearing of the Labour Court so that the matter might be resolved. No company on this island should seek to drive a coach and four through the industrial relations architecture that has been built up successfully over years, particularly at a time security of energy supply is so vital and particularly given that these people have a combined service of more than 100 years. We want to get them back to the table. I call on the Minister of State to use her good offices and those of the Government to intervene on this matter to encourage people back to the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_1186">As the Deputy has stated, SIPTU members have served notice of strike action at Zenith Energy Bantry Bay Terminal Limited, located on Whiddy Island in County Cork. The strike action is due to commence on Tuesday, 13 December, in a dispute over redundancies at Zenith Energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187"> While the Deputy's question refers to the strike at the Zenith storage facility in Bantry, he also makes reference to NORA and the need to ensure the terms and conditions of employment of all employees at the agency are protected and the need to ensure the employer engages with the architecture of industrial relations. In this regard, it is important to clearly state that while NORA holds stocks of petroleum products on the site, NORA employees are not employed on the site nor are they in any way involved in the aforementioned industrial dispute. The employees of Zenith Energy are not NORA employees, NORA merely holds stocks on the site as part of its obligations under legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188"> Under the National Oil Reserves Act 2007, NORA was established as a non-commercial State body with responsibility for the management of Ireland's strategic oil reserve. NORA is Ireland's stockholding agency and currently holds approximately 85 days of oil stocks, with approximately 85% of these stocks stored on the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189"> NORA stocks are balanced to match the end-use domestic consumption of the various oil products, petrol, diesel, and kerosene. NORA, having released stock to meet Ireland's obligations under the recent International Energy Agency, IEA, collective actions, is scheduled to increase its stockholding to 90 days in early 2023 as required by Ireland's membership of the European Union and the IEA. NORA holds 85 to 90 days of oil reserves to cover any emergency for resupply through the commercial system. Ireland's policy of holding a strategic oil reserve equivalent to 90 days of net imports is required by both its membership of the EU and the IEA, and is provided for by the National Oil Reserves Agency Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190"> NORA has operational responsibility for the day-to-day management of the State's strategic oil reserve. This includes the purchase of refined products and entering into agreements with third parties to lease storage capacity, as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191"> In line with Government policy, the 90-day obligation is met almost entirely by the holding of refined product in Ireland, ready to be placed on the domestic market in the event of a shortage of petroleum products arising in the commercial supply chains or released to the international markets as part of an IEA collective action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192"> The industry has worked hard to boost stock levels since the onset of the war in Ukraine and industry is confident of maintaining supply levels with inventory levels strengthened.</p>

            <p eId="para_1193">I am disappointed with the answer. The Whiddy Island terminal is fixed firmly in the consciousness of every citizen's mind as key in the security of energy supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">There would have been a time when somebody like me would have gotten up as a member of the Opposition to call on the Government to use its influence specifically in relation to a site like this. Zenith has a contract and owns the site. If they were driving a coach and four through the industrial relations architecture, an Opposition Deputy would have at least received a response that expressed sympathy with the workers down there. We do not want workers who have had long careers, have excellent skill sets, are highly competent and are highly trained to be replaced while they go out on strike by contractors who are coming in and ultimately are designed to take their place. There was a time in this House when a Minister would have stood opposite me and not given me the answer I have received tonight. </p>
            <p eId="para_1195"> I know what NORA does. The dogs in the street know what NORA does. The dogs in the street can make the distinction between NORA and Zenith in this regard. I want to protect the rights of pre-existing workers who are being shovelled out the door by stealth. They are key workers for this island, given what they do at the terminal. I worry that if we lose their skill set, it will be gone and lost forever. I am merely calling for some sympathy and empathy on the part of the Government for the workers. There should be an acknowledgement by the Government of the need to call on all sides, particularly the owners of the company, to come back to the table - at least - as a starting point.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">Of course the Government expresses its sympathies. We want to ensure that a resolution is found and that employers engage with the industrial relations architecture. That is clear. As I indicated in my initial response, the industrial dispute which was reported in the media today is a dispute over redundancies at Zenith Energy. NORA is not in any way involved in the aforementioned dispute. While NORA holds stocks of petroleum on the site, NORA employees are not employed on the site. The employees of Zenith Energy are not NORA employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198"> In relation to Ireland’s security of supply, Ireland is reasonably well insulated from direct supply shocks because few imports of crude oil and a comparatively small proportion of Ireland’s refined product imports come from Russia. Given that the supply of some products on the international oil markets is currently tight, particularly in the case of diesel, the oil supply position on the Irish markets is kept under review by the oil security subgroup, consisting of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Transport, NORA and the importing oil companies. The group meets frequently to assess the security of oil supplies into Irish terminals which are purchased on a commercial basis one month in advance. As things stand, the supply outlook in January looks positive. Given the just-in-time nature of oil supply, issues can manifest at short notice, perhaps within four or five days. As a contingency, NORA holds approximately 85 days of reserve stock and can place stock onto the domestic market to meet shortfalls. Currently, no substantial difficulties in maintaining supplies to the domestic market are forecast, including subsequent to the full implementation of the EU sanctions on Russian crude and refined product on 5 December 2022 and 5 January 2023, respectively.</p>

          <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_537">
            <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T22:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1199">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter for Topical Issue debate. I thank the Minister of State with responsibility for transport for taking it. I raised this issue briefly with the Minister of State during Priority Questions a couple of weeks ago. There is a significant backlog with the national car test, NCT, and there is a shortage of mechanics and inspectors. I want to raise the types of changes in work and testing practices that are being proposed and implemented in response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200"> I have previously raised the issue of the Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 6 and level 5 qualifications. Some of the issue relates to internal transfers of staff from Spain and elsewhere to Ireland within the Applus+ group. At Christmastime, there will be the prospect of workers coming in from the Philippines. This is nothing at all to do with where workers are originating from. There is a shortage and there is more than enough work to go round. Rather, this is an issue of standards, qualifications and quality related to that. There is an issue in relation to QQI level 6 and level 5.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201"> The response I have received from the Department on this matter confirmed that the Department was apprised of the proposal by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, that the RSA has responsibility in this regard and that assurances have been received. I want to drill into that with the Minister of State. In addition to that and subsequently, there was a Labour Court recommendation last week for a pilot to run in five Dublin centres for 12 months, as well as for new staff at the grade of inspection support personnel to become involved in the testing process, with responsibility for an initial part or one of the stages of the testing process. There are serious concerns. It has been suggested that a €250 One4All voucher could be given to workers as part of this agreement. </p>
            <p eId="para_1202"> The concern here is on a number of levels. First, this appears to me to be a significant change to the testing process itself; to how the test is conducted in practical terms; to who is conducting what part of the test; to their level of qualification, training and expertise; to who is signing off on the test; and to the level of accountability in relation to that. I want to ask a question about existing practices. Is the Minister of State satisfied that standards are being maintained and will be maintained? I also have a question about the sign-off. Are these new processes lawful and consistent with the regulations that govern these practices? I welcome the Minister of State’s response.</p>

            <from>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T22:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1203">The operation of roadworthiness testing, including the National Car Test Service, NCTS, is the statutory responsibility of the RSA. Applus+ Inspection Services Ireland Limited administers the test on behalf of the RSA. All operational issues, including the appointment of personnel are matters for Applus+ and the RSA, and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister of State, to comment on specific operational matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204"> The NCTS has been experiencing extraordinary pressure, due in part to a national and EU-wide labour shortage of qualified mechanics. To mitigate the risks associated with the testing backlog, work is under way to increase test centre capacity and to reduce the average appointment waiting time. A priority waiting list is in place for motorists to avail of cancellations, the contractor is providing 20 vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation and the RSA has approved a pilot for additional inspection staff in automated elements of the test. These measures are in addition to the 53 new staff employed by the NCTS earlier in the year, and a significant increase in staff overtime, allowing eight tests per tester per day instead of seven.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205"> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, with my Department's assistance, has allowed for the recruitment of up to 100 non-EU testers. Some 44 additional testers have commenced training with NCTS and will be conducting testing before the end of the year. In relation to qualifications, I can confirm that the temporary vehicle inspectors from Spain are qualified to QQI level 5, which is the standard in many EU member states and in the UK. Until 2020, QQI level 5 certification was the minimum requirement for vehicle inspectors in the State. </p>
            <p eId="para_1206">Testers in Ireland are currently required to hold QQI level 6 qualifications but the RSA has confirmed that local applicants with QQI level 5 qualifications will be considered for a temporary period and that on-the-job training will be provided to bring testers to QQI level 6 standard. Additionally, I understand that Applus+ sought RSA approval to trial the use of inspection support personnel to assist the existing complement of vehicle inspectors with certain basic and highly automated test elements in stages 1 and 2 of the testing process. Vehicle inspectors will still decide whether a vehicle should pass or fail a test. </p>
            <p eId="para_1207"> I reassure the Deputy that the appointment of these additional resources will not result in the loss of any existing jobs. The new employees will supplement the existing staff to increase testing capacity. The objective is to increase the overall number of testing staff to meet the high demand. The RSA has assured my Department that the high testing standard we expect from the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, will not be compromised in any way as it works to increase testing capacity. </p>

            <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T22:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1208">I will pick up on two points in my supplementary statement. The Minister of State said "The RSA has assured my Department that the high testing standard we expect from the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, will not be compromised in any way as it works to increase testing capacity." To ask the straight question, how has that been assessed? The RSA provided the assurance. I await a response from it and I expect it will give me the same assurance but, for me, that raises a further question; how has it been assessed that the standards will be maintained? We do not yet know what the pilot use of inspection support personnel in those five Dublin test centres will look like, if it proceeds. I understand people who have a junior certificate and an interest in cars or vehicles are being invited to apply. The Department has been assured but how has the RSA or Applus+ assessed this?</p>
            <p eId="para_1209"> I have another question, which is related to the first. Is this legitimate? Is this change in practice lawful? The test is to be broken down into different stages and inspection support personnel are to be given responsibility for one of these parts, although a tester must ultimately sign off on the test. In the regulations, it is very clear what a tester is and what his or her responsibilities are. Is this new testing process lawful? Does it comply with SI 415 of 2017, the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017?</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">I reassure the Deputy that I have met with the RSA and conveyed the seriousness of the NCT backlog. My officials are meeting with the RSA weekly to monitor progress in reducing test delays and supporting any appropriate requests for assistance from it. I also assure the Deputy that the use of inspection support personnel will not result in any job losses in the NCTS. The RSA has my full confidence. The high testing standard we expect from the NCTS will not be compromised. As always, the safety of our road users remains a priority for me and my Department.</p>
