          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator McHugh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the plans she has in place to address the deficits in specific hours of tuition available for children with dyslexia.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the urgent need for an ambulance base at Tuam, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to review urgently her decision on risk equalisation in the health insurance industry and to ensure that competition in health insurance will be defended and promoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the situation regarding the unanimous request of Killarney Town Council and numerous other interested parties in the provision of much-needed land at Church Road, Muckross, County Kerry, as a burial ground in the best interests of the entire community.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the reason no new businesses have been brought to the new IDA centre in Carlow town and when he expects a decision on same.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to have the urgent extension of Ballina national school, Killaloe, County Tipperary, advanced to the next stage in light of the severe overcrowding of the school and of the Government's stated commitment in the programme for Government to reduce class sizes in primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to reconsider the application of the board of management of Abbey national school, Loughrea, County Galway, for an extension and upgrading of facilities at the school in view of the fact that up to 30% of the enrolled students are in need of educational support and special needs assistants.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline his proposals to counteract the adverse effects, both short and long term, for home owners on the route of the designated corridor of the N4 Drumsna to Longford road improvement scheme, particularly those located on the outer fringes, as the proposed development is already affecting property sales.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I regard the matters raised by Senators McHugh, Kitt, Bradford, Coghlan, Browne, O'Meara and Ulick Burke as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators McHugh, Kitt and Bradford and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Coghlan, Browne, O'Meara and Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. I regret I have been obliged to rule out of order the matters raised by SenatorBannon, as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</p>

        <heading>Order of Business.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_18">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 21, motion 25. No. 1 is a sessional order as agreed yesterday by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and will be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on a strategy for men's health (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 4 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not exceeding ten minutes; No. 3, statements on road safety, to be taken from 4 p.m. until 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not exceeding 15 minutes and of Senators not exceeding ten minutes. We hope to resume this debate later, as I am aware that many Senators will wish to contribute. It is a matter of ensuring the Minister's availability; and No. 21, motion 25, will be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I welcome No. 1 on the Order Paper, the motion which extends the time for contributions to the Order of Business to 40 minutes. I thank all colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for agreeing to that motion. It is worthwhile and long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that following the conclusion of the Order of Business statements on road tolling be taken for a period of one hour. This, in effect, would put off No. 2, statements on a strategy for men's health (resumed), to another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The Leader of the House will tell me in reply that there is no guarantee that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, would come to the House at such short notice. I do not want him in the House today, given the fiasco he has created for the commuters of Dublin over the past 48 hours and over the weekend. Just when we thought that the hard-pressed motorist would be liberated from the appalling toll plaza on the M50, we get another consultant's report and we cannot expect any action from the Government for at least two years. This is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">That road is clogged up on a daily basis. It does untold damage to families, motorists and business and it will get worse over the next 18 months as the port tunnel comes on stream. Senators on all sides need to debate this matter today because the Taoiseach has dumped on his Minister with responsibility in this area. It is clear from the spinning of the story last Saturday that there will be barrier-free tolling at various points on the M50, that people in my constituency who are currently not charged for using the road will subsidise the buy-out of NTR. We need to debate this matter today.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I will give another reason we need to debate it. I heard Senator Cox on the national broadcaster earlier this week make a compelling case for the need for a debate on tolling to the effect that within a matter of 12 months people coming from the west of Ireland will have to pay three tolls to get to Dublin city. There is much interest in this story. It is the issue of the day, one we should debate, and I ask the Leader to accede to my request.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">In passing, I congratulate the people of Cork. I see that a former Member of this House, one of the great pillars of Irish democracy, former Senator John A. Murphy, has received the distinctive honour of becoming Cork person of the year. I congratulate him and the people of Cork.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">A good Independent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_26">We are all in favour of that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_27">All of us on the Independent benches would wish to be associated with those words of congratulations to former Senator Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I welcome the extension of the Order of Business and thank the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for moving on the issue. By way of explanation, it has been extended to 40 minutes from the time the Leader sits down following the announcement of the Order of Business, in other words it is effectively the guts of 45 minutes. It is a good development.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's position on tolling. It is not so much the cost of getting from Galway to Dublin as the cost of getting from Dublin to Galway that would bother me. After all the debate on the M50, the idea that we will finish up by giving National Toll Roads €0.5 billion and making sure that everybody who uses the road from now on must pay something is a step backwards and is unacceptable. I would certainly look forward to such a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">Previously I raised with the Leader the question of a debate on national partnership talks. My colleague, Senator Ross, raised the matter here last week and I contacted the Leader on a number of occasions in the meantime. As talks are about to begin, it would seem helpful to debate the issues, which normally are the reports of the three bodies, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Economic and Social Council and the National Centre for Partnership, on which they are based. This would be more than helpful because it would require people to offer their views on how the wealth of the State should be redistributed. I would look forward to hearing my colleague, Senator Ross, explain how he feels that the profits and the wealth created by the State should be redistributed. It would force us to do that and it would be very helpful to hear the different views on it. A division was called on this issue in the Lower House earlier after Deputies sought a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">It was recommended that partnership debates should be part of the future functions of the House in the report on Seanad reform and such a debate would be a good opportunity to give the recommendation a dry run, see how it works and, perhaps, come back to the issue during the talks.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I support my colleagues in their call for a debate on partnership and a number of issues that people do not want to talk about badly need to be discussed. For example, there has been a great deal of talk about the fact that unemployment levels have remained low and have not changed. However, 20,000 more people are unemployed now than four years ago but because unemployment is measured in percentage terms——</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_44">More people are at work but it is extraordinary that in a country in which the numbers in employment are increasing, the numbers unemployed are also increasing. In addition, the number of people leaving the workforce is increasing and it is substantially higher than four years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The second issue is that approximately two thirds of workers in non-unionised workforces would join a union if their management would not penalise them for doing so. That is the product of research conducted by people in UCD and I have no reason to doubt it. It is extraordinary that one pillar of the partnership process, namely, employers, is trying to prevent its employees from being part of another pillar. That is the perception and I seek a debate in which those who claim to understand employers better than I do state clearly that they would support the idea that nobody should be penalised in employment or in promotion because of their membership of a trade union. That would be a good idea and I look forward to hearing all my colleagues' state their support.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">In addition, I seek a debate on the attitude of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to partnership. The Department refused to disclose reports about conditions in centres for asylum seekers claiming they were commercially sensitive. It took a decision by the Information Commissioner to release that information. The reports were politically, not commercially, sensitive because they showed that many of the centres were being run very badly. I refer to the Thornton Hall issue. Residents in the area cannot obtain a single straight answer from the Department, which apparently will use its powers to ignore planning laws, zoning and local communities. I do not know how we can have a serious partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">I do not wish to be picky but how can the House pass a motion calling for a continuation of the practice of the Leader replying to the Order of Business not later than 40 minutes after it commences when we never had the practice in the first place? The practice was 30 minutes. I hate being picky but the House was involved in a Supreme Court case because some of us did not read a motion particularly well and the Supreme Court had to make a decision on it. One of the reasons was the motion was badly worded. It is our responsibility if motions are badly worded.</p>

Now that the HSE is such a huge organisation, with the hospitals' office in Naas and primary care headquarters in Limerick, it is important that there is a dedicated phone line. It is worrying that people do not have the same access to services that they had in the past, particularly in regard to children's issues. There should be a dedicated phone line. If there was a debate on the matter, perhaps we would finalise these proposals, and other proposals in this very good report.</p>

I call on the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House to arrange a debate to discuss the energy industry, including competition within it.

          <p eId="para_98">I support Senator Brian Hayes's proposal. An industrialist in Galway over the coming years will face not three but four proposed tollings on a journey from Galway city to Dublin Port. A toll is proposed for the Galway outer ring road and one is proposed for Cappataggle, Ballinasloe, County Galway. There is a toll on the Enfield-Kinnegad road and on the M50. Currently a return journey from Galway to Dublin would involve an added cost to an industrialist of about €50, with increases pending. There is a decided disadvantage for an industrialist to locate in the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Another Minister is promoting what he calls "regional balance" with regard to industrial development. How can a unified Government penalise an industrialist to that extent in moving goods from Galway to Dublin Port while the notion of regional balance is being promoted?

I acknowledge that improvements have been made in this regard. The Minister has issued a number of new sets of guidelines, for example. We need to debate people's right to object to various plans, which is something we have not yet dealt with adequately. New guidelines are needed because it is not reasonable that people who are not directly affected by plans have the right to lodge objections. In some cases, those making objections do not live in the area which is to be affected or even in this country. Such objections can prevent certain forms of development, such as one-off houses and commercial developments which create employment. For example, people who do not live in County Roscommon are blocking a proposed development in a forest park in that county. The future of the development in question, which would create significant employment and would represent a good amenity for the entire region, was debated in this House last week. Objections against one-off housing are being lodged all over the western seaboard, particularly in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. We need to re-examine the roles of An Taisce, Dúchas and other bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">The implementation of the nitrates directive is something of a national disaster. It seems that farmers are being expected to retain every scrap of paper about feed and fertiliser. They have not been told exactly what is required of them. The implementation of the directive should be postponed until a comprehensive information campaign has been put in place. Farmers have been very badly let down. The directive could render the rural environment protection scheme, in which 50,000 farmers are participating, null and void. Some 350,000 people work outside the farm gate in the agriculture industry, which is worth €7 billion to the economy each year.</p>

It strikes me that if not enough work is being generated to necessitate Seanad sittings on Tuesdays, the House could usefully consider reports of this nature, including the reports of the Ombudsman and the Mental Health Commission. It does not look well that the House is meeting for just two days a week, having recently returned from a long recess.</p>

It is important to listen to what the ombudsman is saying and have a debate on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The Irish Cancer Society has undertaken to raise the issue of the failure of the Government to extend screening for cervical cancer which is available only in the mid-west region. This is an important issue because, as is the case with breast cancer screening, women's lives are at risk. I ask the Leader, as she has done on the breast cancer issue, to take up this issue and let us debate it in the House and ensure the matter is kept on the agenda. I see no reason this screening programme cannot be extended. It does not involve an exorbitant cost, it is not as difficult to achieve as breast screening and is operated through GPs. The bottom line is it makes a difference; it saves lives. I ask the Leader to put the issue on the agenda as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">I agree with the call for a discussion on toll plazas. The Minister should be here and should be commended for making what was a difficult decision which has taken some time. The debate should deal with the whole issue of the National Roads Authority. There are issues around not only tolling on short-term routes and bypasses on long stretches but also on the question of public private partnerships. These need to be debated in a non-partisan way. The terms of the contract with NTR, which were negotiated by a Labour Minister in 1986 on behalf of the then coalition Government, should also be part of the debate.</p>

In view of the many calls for such a debate it would be extremely useful to hold it and I hope we could all learn from it. The Minister does not appear to have learned any lessons from the disaster of the West Link toll bridge. He is going to compound the difficulties and the problems by removing the toll plaza but introducing tolls elsewhere on the M50. We know how that has created gridlock on the M50. There is a need to look at tolls throughout the country.</p>

I have not found any members of Government parties who know anything of these changes.

We are building private hospitals in the carparks of public hospitals and at the same time we insist the consultants cannot co-exist between these hospitals.

          <p eId="para_197">Over the past few weeks many farmers have taken the opportunity, provided by the good weather and favourable soil conditions, to spread slurry. Next year, if farmers are presented with the same ideal weather conditions, they will face six months in prison if they spread slurry at the end of January. This is due to a new directive, which allows slurry to be spread only from February, not in January. We are faced with a serious situation as we seek to represent farmers' needs. Farmers have been the custodians of our landscape for generations and know what is best for the land. I accept a minority of rogue farmers exists but farmers know what is best practice and they should know when to spread fertiliser or slurry. Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated he was satisfied with the progress and the process of the directive. The farmers to whom I spoke are dissatisfied. The buck has been passed between the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food over a long period. It is an absolute disgrace for the farmers to hear from Senator Mansergh that the new solution for their needs is social partnership.</p>

If that is the Government's policy on transportation and tolling it is no wonder there is such gridlock, backlog and congestion on the M50 and throughout the country on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I also concur with my colleagues in asking the Leader to arrange a debate on the nitrates directive. I asked for such a debate last week and it is timely that we have it. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has deferred implementation of aspects of the directive. If it were to be implemented in the manner in which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government sought on 1 February, it would have had a very detrimental impact on commercial agriculture in this country. Senator McHugh is correct to state that farmers know what is best practice. They have been the custodians of the land for generations. They know when soil and ground conditions are correct to apply fertiliser, whether it is artificial or organic. Some weight should be given to the years of experience farmers have gathered before this directive is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I agree with the point made by Senator Leyden on the announced withdrawal of Statoil from the fuel market. It is a retrograde step. The company stated this morning that it is withdrawing because it is being undercut, particularly by competitors such as Tesco. However, Statoil is one of the main suppliers of fuel to Tesco in this country. How can it make such a statement and keep a straight face? It beggars belief.</p>

I take my duties as Leader of the House very seriously. Senator Browne suggested flippantly that I am here only two days a week, whereas I was here at 9 a.m yesterday and met several Senators. How dare he suggest that I treat the House in that fashion. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to see that an apology is proffered. That is the least that can be done, given the disgraceful sentiments expressed by Senator Browne. I stay four days a week in Dublin; I am very affronted by what the Senator said.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">Senator Terry Leyden asked that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the House to explain the Statoil situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Senator Ulick Burke was concerned that people who set up industry in Galway and other parts of the west of Ireland will be penalised by four tolls each time they travel. He also raised the need for regional balance in enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Senator MacSharry asked for a right to object to planning and demanded a debate on planning. I agree with him about the increasing difficulties experienced by young people — not only single men or women but also couples — in trying to get a house because all sorts of objections are raised. We could usefully have a debate on planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the nitrates directive. On the matter of REPS, those who are participating do not have to adjust their levels as of now, which will certainly relieve them. Senator Coghlan should find a message on his mobile telephone about that matter.</p>

If I may deal with the matter that so many Members have mentioned, I should make it clear that we cannot introduce legislation at the moment because we have already passed numerous Bills on which debate in the Dáil has not even started. We cannot introduce new Bills until the Dáil clears some of the Bills we have passed. The situation is quite amazing, but that is what has happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">Senator Jim Walsh asked for a debate on the 1916 commemorations. He also sought a debate on the toll plazas and on the terms of the NTR contract. Senator Sheila Terry seeks a debate on tolling and on PPPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Senator Mansergh asked for a debate on nitrates. However, I could not get over the howl that came from the Opposition benches — they are in howling form today — when Senator Mansergh suggested that farmers' issues be discussed as part of the social partnership talks. Such issues are always discussed and are one of the pillars of the social partnership. Senator Mansergh is quite correct, but I think the howling betrays the Opposition's underlying feeling towards the social partnership talks.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">Senator Mansergh also spoke about Senator Stanford and how he wished more of his faith would participate in debates on matters such as the 1916 Rising or its ideals. Senator Cummins raised the issue of lap dancing and expressed fears about where such clubs are situated. We should say well done to Senator Ross who has been very stalwart about road tolling. He asked that the Minister come to the House and he congratulated the Taoiseach on his U-turn. A Labour Party Minister negotiated the terms of the tolls but a Fianna Fáil Minister signed off on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Senator Bannon raised the nitrates directive. Senator Quinn called for a debate on energy, as he did before Christmas. I also noticed the telling phrase used by President Bush when he referred to Americans as being "addicted to oil". Senator Feighan called for a debate on planning linked with tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Senator Tuffy raised the issue of tolls and called for a debate on the 1916 Rising. She is right in that James Connolly was one of the heroes of 1916. His ideals are very redolent of what happened then and afterwards and they still remain vibrant in Irish society. Of course, we should talk about him when we debate 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Senator Bradford raised the recent National Economic and Social Forum report on the elderly. We will seek to have debates on a plethora of reports next week. I will have great delight in noting who is and who is not present. Senators are so keen for work.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Senator Henry referred to No. 5, motion 21, on the Order Paper. She was also worried about the sudden change in how consultants would carry out their work which was announced this morning. We will seek to get the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House, which I understand is what the Senator would like to see happen.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_344">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, to the House. I will have sufficient time to finish a point which I believe to have some practical application and which comes from my own limited experience of hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I have had some difficulties with my prostate which obliged me to be taken into hospital for an examination. It is a fairly simple and routine matter entailing the insertion of a fibre optic camera. As one is knocked out for this procedure, I thought it would be all right, would cause no bother and so on. However, the insertion of such a device into the urethra has a tendency to dislodge germs. Moreover, particularly if the surgeon fumbles somewhat or encounters some kind of problem, it can also create bleeding. In a small number of cases, this can lead to infection. I ended up with septicaemia, an extremely serious infection, was hospitalised for a number of weeks as a result and was quite desperately ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">However, it is important that men know this need not happen. I was informed that this happens once in every 3,000 procedures. Consequently, given the low incidence level, antibiotic cover is not provided. However, four or five of the men in a gym which I attend in the centre of Dublin have experienced exactly the same infection. Hence, I believe the rate is considerably higher than one in 3,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Septicaemia is very dangerous. It is extraordinarily weakening, extremely painful and disorientating. I went into a form of shock, my temperature rose and fell repeatedly, I was unable to hold the telephone and was half-hallucinating.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">It is important that a patient discuss with his doctor whether he or she thinks it appropriate to get full antibiotic cover. Were I to have this procedure again, I would insist on it. I should note that I have had the procedure performed again in another hospital with an excellent surgeon and I experienced only mild discomfort. I am not sure whether it a question of the skill of the surgeon but I know that there is a serious risk in that regard.</p>

I am not sure how true that is but patients need the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence. I look forward to continuing the debate on the next occasion because there are important issues to raise, including testicular cancer.

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_218">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_355">Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I am pleased to be here in Seanad Éireann for this important discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">At the end of the first month of this year 39 lives have been lost as a direct result of road collisions. The total for January represents an increase of six over the total in January last year. That experience has been replicated in many months in the recent past and the reality is that we are now facing a major and immediate road safety challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I will not rehearse the case that over the past eight years, since we adopted the first road safety strategy, we have made measurable progress in terms of the achievement of reductions in road casualties. It is an undeniable fact that since the end of last summer the death toll on our roads has been rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Some 399 people lost their lives as a result of road collisions in 2005. That is an increase of 64 on the total in 2003, which saw the lowest level of road deaths in over 40 years. It is now a simple imperative that the trends of the past number of months must be reversed and that progress be made on a sustained basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">This debate affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the response that the Government is making to support the achievement of the necessary changes to the situation in which we find ourselves. This response is based on the delivery of the commitments set out in the Road Safety Strategy 2004 to 2006. That strategy had a very narrow planning horizon and in recognition of that, it was always accepted that many of the key initiatives could only be delivered towards the end of the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The major policy initiatives targeted for delivery over the lifetime of the strategy are as follows: the introduction of a new system of speed limits based on the adoption of metric values; the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps; the extension of the application of the penalty points system; the introduction of a programme for the engagement of private sector interests in the operation of speed cameras; and the introduction of a form of random breath testing.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Drinking and driving is recognised as one of the most serious contributory factors in road collisions in this and all other countries. Despite ongoing efforts to inform and educate drivers of the inherent dangers in mixing alcohol and driving and the commitment of the Garda to enforce the law, there are still many who will not desist from what can only be described as reckless, selfish and irresponsible behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The road safety strategy promotes the introduction of random roadside preliminary breath testing. A detailed examination of the possible approaches that could be adopted to allow for the introduction of a scheme that would contribute in a positive way to address the problem of drinking and driving has been pursued. That examination was progressed in close consultation with the Attorney General with a view to establishing a balance between, on the one hand, the legitimate expectations of society as a whole that the level of road deaths and injuries must be radically reduced and, on the other hand, the rights of citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">As the Taoiseach announced in the other House last Wednesday, the Attorney General has provided advice on the exercise of the powers available to the Garda to stop vehicles for the purpose of the enforcement of traffic laws generally and, in particular, the enforcement of drink driving laws. He has also advised on the development of a scheme for the operation of random breath testing in a targeted manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">In his contribution to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on 25 January, the Garda Commissioner welcomed this advice and gave a commitment that, as a result, the Garda would pursue enhanced levels of enforcement of drink driving based on the current legal structures. Those current structures provide that the Garda may require that a driver must submit to a preliminary roadside test where a vehicle has been involved in a collision, where a traffic offence has been committed or where a member of the Garda is of the opinion that the driver has consumed alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The attorney has also advised on the development of a scheme for the operation of random breath testing in a targeted manner. Based on that specific advice, I will bring forward legislation during the current Oireachtas session that will allow the Garda to establish roadside checkpoints at which drivers will be required to submit to a preliminary test for the presence of alcohol. The legislation will provide the basis for the production of guidelines that will establish definite parameters for the application of these proposed checkpoints. The actual terms of the guidelines will be developed by my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda in close co-operation with the Office of the Attorney General. The introduction of the new system will mean that the enforcement regime available to the Garda will result in the level of general deterrence needed to address drink driving in a comprehensive and robust way.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The House will be aware that last week I announced a major extension to the operation of the penalty points system. The focus of that extension will be on those offences that relate directly to driver behaviour. Unfortunately, 86% of all road deaths can be attributed to driver behaviour in its broadest sense. This extension will see the system being applied in respect of 31 new offences, bringing the total to 35. All of the new offences relate directly to driver behaviour. They include the offence of failure to obey stop and yield signs and traffic lights, crossing white lines and illegal overtaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">There was a positive response to the initial roll-out of penalty points. The resultant improvement in road safety reflected a more precautionary approach by drivers in the knowledge that repeated poor behaviour would be reflected in the accumulation of penalty points. As of the end of December 2005, over 291,800 drivers have had penalty points endorsed on their licences and 19 stood disqualified at that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">As we all know, that early improvement in road safety has not been maintained. The extension of the application of penalty points from April is aimed at reversing recent trends and instilling a greater sense of responsibility in motorists. The extension of the penalty points system will be supported by the application of the fixed charge system to the majority of the new penalty point offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The metrication of speed limits involved the introduction of a revised speed limit structure, including a reduction in the speed limit on regional roads and local roads. The changeover went smoothly and is a good example of co-operation between different national and local agencies to ensure that a project is delivered successfully. The Road Traffic Act 2004 provides the legal basis for the system. The Act also provided that the range of special speed limits that county and city councillors can apply was extended, and special new arrangements for speed limits at road works were introduced. Special guidance has been given to local authorities to assist in the exercise of their roles. One other significant change introduced was the addition to the consultation process relating to the adoption of special speed limits of a direct engagement with the public at large. I would now urge local authorities to pursue a review of speed limits based on their extended powers so that a realistic and coherent application of speed limits will result.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced in November 2004 the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. This is a key element to changing road user behaviour. The presence of a high-visibility force on the roads will instil caution in drivers. The numbers in the traffic corps by the end of 2008 will be 1,200 which is over twice the number currently engaged in traffic duties. The corps is led by an assistant commissioner which ensures that traffic and enforcement matters feature at the highest management levels within the Garda. I very much welcome this positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I am developing legislation which will be brought forward during the current Oireachtas session to provide for the operation of privately-operated cameras. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will then undertake a tendering process to engage a private operator. This is an important element of an enforcement strategy and is the best way to ensure a high level of speed enforcement is reached. I reassure anyone who has fears of the introduction of such a system, however, that there will be no connection between the receipt of fixed charge payments resulting from detections and the funding of the operation. This initiative is focused on the promotion of road safety. It will feature the establishment of clear management structures both at the strategic and operational levels under the general supervision of the Garda. In addition, the Garda will make the site selection for the placement of cameras with the assistance of the National Roads Authority. The criteria for site selection will be grounded on collision history and the history of speeding incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The process of establishing the road safety authority is well advanced. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004, which has completed Second Stage in the Lower House, provides the legislative basis for establishing the authority. The principal purpose of the Bill was to establish a driver testing and standards authority whose primary responsibility will be the delivery of the driver testing service and the regulation of driving instructors. The authority will also have a statutory duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards. As the House will be aware from the Second Stage debate, the Government decided to amend the Bill to enable other functions to be assigned to the authority, which will ensure it can play an important role in improving road safety in general. The body will, therefore, be known as the road safety authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The authority will be a single agency with responsibility for a wide range of functions that have a bearing on road safety and it will be in a unique position to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda through delivery of a range of road safety programmes. These will include the testing of drivers and vehicles, driver education and the promotion of awareness of road safety, issues relating to transport sector workers, the oversight of the national car testing service and other vehicle safety issues. The authority will also be given responsibility for road safety research. This will enable the authority to both analyse the causes of road accidents and evaluate what action might be taken and make appropriate recommendations where necessary. The authority will have significant advisory role to the Minister in the development of road safety policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">In advance of the formal establishment of the authority, I propose to appoint an interim board. This gives a clear indication of the importance I and the Government place on the proposed authority as an instrument to improve road safety. An interim board with varied relevant experience will also bring valuable expertise and support to the CEO and staff transferring to the authority, which would undoubtedly be of benefit during its establishment phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In a further recognition of the need to promote road safety as a key and urgent area of public policy, I also announced last week that a new high level Government road safety group, comprising the Ministers for Transport, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance, Health and Children and Education and Science is to be formed. I will chair the group, which will also include senior Government officials and the group's first meeting will be held tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Safety on our roads is an important element of public policy. As a society, we cannot accept the inevitability of the rates of casualties we have witnessed in the recent past. The Government is committed to the reversal of the current trend and the policy initiatives I have outlined are aimed at achieving that result. They reflect and demonstrate the Government's determination to deal with road safety in an immediate and effective manner. I appeal to all drivers to reduce their speed, drive within the speed limit and, for heaven's sake, not to drink and drive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_377">I welcome the Minister to the House and I concur with his concluding remarks. Everybody should be asked to drive more carefully. Recently, it was stated that if drivers reduced their speed by 5 mph, it would have a significant impact on road safety. I sympathise with all those who have lost relatives following road accidents over the past number of years and, in particular, over the month of January when 39 people lost their lives. That was the highest number of road deaths in January for five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The issues of road safety and, in particular, driver behaviour have been raised regularly in the House over the years. It it time to do something radical to change the behaviour of drivers. A code of conduct should be introduced for drivers because driving patterns in Ireland are not similar, for example, to England. As one drives on motorways or dual carriageways in Ireland, one is passed out regularly on the inside by other motorists. If one, for example, is travelling in the middle lane of a three-lane motorway, one could be passed on either side by other motorists. In England, the right hand lane only is used to pass other vehicles and if one is not travelling fast enough in that lane, one moves into the left hand lane.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">In the early 1990s car ownership in Ireland was measured at 28 per 100 head of population while the European average was 56 cars per 100. Car ownership must exceed this now, as the number of cars purchases has increased significantly over the past ten years. While improvements have been made, our roads have not been improved enough while driver behaviour has also not improved enough. A great deal could be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The main road safety issues are speed, drink, drugs, mobile telephone usage, poor signage and driver frustration. The latter issue is significant. The Minister will add 31 offences to the penalty points system later this year. Under the new system if one drives on the hard shoulder, it will be an offence and penalty points will be incurred.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_385">Tractors must use dual carriageways to transport farm produce such as sugar beet and they often travel on the hard shoulder to ease the way for other motorists. I am afraid they will incur penalty points and I hope that will not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">There is ambiguity about the random breath testing issue. The advice given to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport by the Attorney General was that such testing would be unconstitutional. However, the Taoiseach announced last week in the Dáil that random breath testing would be introduced. Our courts have been clogged with various cases taken under road traffic legislation regarding breathalyser usage. The Attorney General provided advice, which the Taoiseach contradicted in the Dáil, and this could leave the issue of random breath testing open to different interpretations, which could result in many cases being contested and numerous people escaping without conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">In 2003, some 335 people were killed on our roads, in 2004, 378 were killed, in 2005, 399 were killed and already this year 39 people have been killed. There has been a significant increase in road deaths over the past years. I hope the extra penalty points announced by the Minister will have the impact the system had initially. When the Minister initially announced the penalty points system, there was a significant reduction in the number of accidents and a big change in driver behaviour on our roads. I hope that when the extra penalty points are introduced it will have the same impact. The Government can do much more in regard to how drivers behave and how we do our business when travelling from A to B.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The number of motorists suspected of driving under the influence of drugs increased by 30% in 2005, yet there is no system in place to deal with drug driving. Roadside equipment is already being piloted in the UK to test for drug driving. This is an area we should examine because the level of drug taking has increased throughout the country. It is, therefore, natural to assume that if people are taking drugs, they are also driving under the influence of drugs. I drive as much as anyone at night time. When I am travelling at night, there is very little traffic on the roads, yet a huge number of one vehicle crashes take place at night, whether on national primary or national secondary routes. Everyone would like to know why is this the case. Some type of survey or independent monitoring of this aspect should take place because, while the roads are quiet and the volume of traffic is down at night time, a huge number of people are being killed on the roads then.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">There are also problems in regard to motorcyclists. While one motorcyclist is killed each week on Irish roads, the Government has still to deliver on its promise to introduce compulsory basic training for motorcyclists. This was promised in 1999 and 2002 and in the national roads safety strategy 2004-06. It appears that motorcyclists are 17 times more likely to be killed than a driver of car. This represents 25% of driver deaths, even though motorcyclists represent just 2% of the total number of licensed drivers. The Government has not done much in regard to motorcyclists.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">There was the episode whereby Mr. Eddie Shaw resigned because he felt the Government was not doing enough to protect road users. More than half of all drivers fail the driving test, which must point to poor driving behaviour by participants, and poor driving instruction. The Government has failed to introduce regulation of the driving instruction process. Anyone can currently set up a driving school because there are no stipulations for drivers to have a full driving licence. We need better regulation and certification of driving schools. One in six drivers on Irish roads has not yet passed the full driving test, which means they are on provisional driving licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The high number of provisional drivers is largely due to a 43% driving test failure rate, long waiting times and no incentive to pass the test. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system which allows almost 1,400 people to fail the test each week. The Government refuses to regulate driving instructors. It is not prepared to provide a driving structure for driver training. The driving test needs to be reformed urgently. For example, the sheet given to people who fail the test does not explain why they failed or what the position is. Something must be done in regard to these issues. The Minister did not include the use of mobile phones in the extra penalty points. The increased usage of mobile phones in cars is a contributory factor in some accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">While Government and Opposition parties are united in trying to solve this problem, I agree with the Minister when he says that everyone should take more care on our roads. Someone said on "Prime Time" or some other programme during the week that if we reduced our speed by 5 mph, it would greatly help the situation. The Department of Transport and the Minister are slowly putting together the Garda traffic corps. More gardaí should be assigned to this task. One way to deter people from speeding is the presence of the gardaí on our roads, particularly on the national primary and secondary routes. The public believe that the gardaí are out to catch people. If there is a Garda presence, people will automatically reduce their speed. This should not be an exercise in collecting revenue for the State. While it will cost the Government and taxpayers money to assign more gardaí to the traffic corps, the main objective of the exercise should not be to hound people but to see that they drive and behave properly, particularly on the national routes, which is not the case. The public believe that the gardaí position themselves at strategic locations to try to catch people. These locations may not be where accidents occur but where people are more likely to put the boot down.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I welcome some of the points proposed by the Minister. I am pleased he clarified the position in regard to the hard shoulder, which only applies to the motorway, and that it is not an offence to cross the white line if one is entering one's farmyard or house. Some people understood it would be an offence to cross over a continuous white line. There is much the Government can do in this regard. The Government, which has been in office for almost eight years, has done very little in that time. The public has taken advantage of the lack of activity on the part of the Government in not putting in place the proper resources to deal with this issue, which has been to the detriment of those who have been killed on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I hope the Minister of State will inform the Minister for Transport that more needs to be done in this regard. However, I agree with some of the measures he is putting in place.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important matter. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on the script he delivered and the information he provided to the House. I wish his officials well in their deliberations in the next number of weeks and particularly with the new interdepartmental group mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I agree with what Senator Paddy Burke said, particularly on the all-party approach to this matter. I extend sympathy to all those affected by the deaths on our roads. As Senator Paddy Burke said, there has been a significant increase in the number of road fatalities already this year. A total of 39 people lost their lives on our roads in January of this year. That is a worrying trend. There was an increase in the number of road fatalities last year compared to the previous year. There was a significant number of road fatalities last year with the number reaching 300 by the end of year. That was a significant increase on the previous year and was the highest since 2001. Notwithstanding the introduction of penalty points, the incidence of road deaths is bedevilling all elements of society. We cannot take the approach to this matter that the Government has not acted in the way that it should. Senator Paddy Burke has been fair in that respect in attempting to analyse or rationalise, as we all do on a daily basis, this situation to understand where the problems lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">On the trend in the number of road fatalities this year, it is difficult to analyse figures with such a small snapshot of incidents, but 25% of the road deaths to date are of non-nationals. That is particularly tragic when one considers that many of these people have left relatively poor economies to come here to better their lives and those of their families and in the course of doing that they have lost their lives. That is particularly worrying. I would not like to draw any other inference from that trend. There has been an attempt in the media and by certain people for political gain to try to make links to the race issue. That is neither welcome nor helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Another interesting statistic is that 45% of those who died on our roads this year were under 30 year of age. We knew that a concentration of young people die on our roads. These are people who do not have the same experience or perhaps regard for road safety as those who have more experience and more responsibilities in life. We must bear in mind that many of the people killed on our roads are from the younger cohort of the motoring population. That must inform us in developing future policy. The Government is taking this matter seriously, particularly with the introduction of measures announced in terms of the additional penalty points this week and, more particularly, the interdepartmental group the Minister mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">It is also worth taking into account some statistics although they can at times be misleading. In 2001 when there were 411 road deaths, there were 1.6 million cars on our roads. The number of cars on our roads has increased to 2.1 million and there were 399 deaths on our roads last year. Taking account of the increased number of cars on the road, the number of road deaths is not as bad in real terms as it might seem. There has also been a growth in our population in that period. I do not want in any way to imply that any person killed on our roads should be addressed as a statistic. However, in analysing the incidence of road deaths, it is worth noting that in terms of the number of road deaths as a ratio to the number of cars on our road and the increase in our population, we are changing our behaviour and attitude, albeit not quickly enough. Statistics show that to benchmark ourselves to the best practice in road safety in other countries we could do significantly better. Mr. Eddie Shaw has been to the fore in highlighting that. He has said that while no death is acceptable, a figure of 250 or 260 in terms of road fatalities is the figure that would be so-called acceptable for the size and population of this country. We have to try to achieve that reduced figure as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Minister referred to driver behaviour being at the root of most accidents, and we know that to be the case. When one notes the ages of those killed on our roads, it is clear that the safer drivers are in the older cohort of the motoring population and tend to be more responsible — correspondingly, their road behaviour tends to be safer and they are less prone to having an accident. The goal facing us is to try to change driver behaviour and culture. The measures the Government is discussing are welcome in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">In terms of changing the attitude to and culture of driver behaviour, one cannot simply decide to do that at 9.30 a.m. on a Monday and hope that it will be achieved by 5 p.m. on Friday. It takes almost a generation to bring about that change. The stringent measures in place in terms of penalties for the offences of drink driving and speeding do not act as a deterrent. At times motorists feel they can get away with such behaviour because the gardaí cannot police every street corner or back road in a country the size of Ireland. Therefore, some motorists will take risks. Many accidents have taken place on small country roads. Even if the size of the Garda force were trebled, our country roads could not be policed. It is simply not feasible to do so. Far too much emphasis has been placed on the lack of enforcement. While it is a major issue, some groups are of the view that if the Garda force was doubled or increased to a certain number, there would be more gardaí on street corners, but that is not possible given the dispersed population and rural nature of the country. Accidents are not happening on the motorways and dual carriageways to the extent one might expect. An analysis of road accidents shows they happen in the main on back roads, minor roads and, at times, unapproved roads. In this context, the issue of driver behaviour and education comes into play. I have harped on about the interdepartmental task force, as I consider it is one of the major planks forward in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science is very much aware of that. She is to be applauded for the work she has done in adult education. There is a role for continuous learning in this context, a concept the Minister espoused in a major way in her time in the Department, whereby people are on a learning curve for the rest of their lives. Such education could be used to change driver behaviour on our roads through people gaining an understanding of issues related to driving and the changes needed. The Department of Education and Science might be able to contribute in that respect because this matter not only comes under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although it plays a significant part in terms of the traffic corps. There must be a joined-up approach to dealing with this issue, on which Government is working. That is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The random breath testing issue has been well covered by the Minister. The proposal legislation is welcome and I look forward to its introduction. It will remove the necessity for a garda to form an opinion on the alcohol consumption of a motorist. This issue has been bandied about in the courts for too long. Court cases have turned into an interrogation of a garda and about how she or he formed an initial opinion, regardless of the results of the intoxication test. We hear from some gardaí reports that a motorist might fall out of the vehicle such is the level of the individual's intoxication but it can be challenged in court that the garda did not form the opinion in the correct way and, subsequently, the case is thrown out of court regardless of what the intoxication test showed or the state of the individual concerned at the time. It is to be welcomed that this issue will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I do not want to cross the line but the Judiciary also has a role to play. There is a complete separation of powers and that is necessary, but it is clear from debates in the Oireachtas what is the intention of the Executive and the Legislature in this context at this time. My basic understanding of the way the law works is that the judge is there to interpret the legislation within the confines of the Constitution. The intention of the Oireachtas is clear; it certainly is not that with crafty parsing of legal text a garda can become the person being interrogated and the individual concerned who has been proven, through the evidential breath test and the intoxiliser test, to have been well over the limit can find a way through the system. I suppose drink driving was acceptable or semi-acceptable at one time but that culture has changed, certainly in more recent years. We must deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I have always had a cautious approach to the introduction of penalty points. I welcomed the initial introduction of the penalty points and I give a guarded welcome to the current round of penalty points, although I would not want the penalty points to go any further. I understand that initially up to 60 offences were identified as being worthy of penalty point accumulation. Some of them bordered on the ridiculous. We might lose a certain amount of the public's buy-in to this concept if we go down that road to the fullest extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The list of offences which attracts penalty points at present is important because it affects driver behaviour. I have said on many occasions that education is important if we are to change driver attitudes and culture. The offences which initially led to the imposition of penalty points were speeding, failure to use a seat belt, drink driving and dangerous driving. Further measures are being put in place at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I am not sure that penalty points are appropriate in the case of a driver who is not in the correct lane when turning onto another road. I have found myself in the wrong lane on more than one occasion, particularly when I was on roads with which I was not familiar. I hope that penalty points will apply in such instances only on major roads with the maximum speed limit. I am not sure that penalty points should be imposed when people choose the incorrect lane in confined areas such as villages and towns. Those of us who come to Dublin on a weekly basis find that the lay-out of lanes on streets can change from week to week. The regulations in this regard should be subject to a liberal interpretation or further qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I have seen the basic information sheet on the new penalty points regime. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to discuss this matter with her officials. We need to amend the regulations to ensure that the offence I have mentioned does not attract penalty points in towns, villages and other places where restricted speed limits are in place. Drivers can easily find themselves in the outside lane when travelling at a snail's pace. I understand the need to ensure that drivers do not swerve from the outside lane across the inside lane to try to reach the exit on a dual carriageway or a motorway. There is no justification for such behaviour because exits are very well signposted on all primary routes. I would like the Minister of State to clarify this matter at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The striking advertisements with which we are familiar demonstrate that a real effort has been made to increase publicity as part of an overall programme of driver education. There has been a helpful degree of co-operation on both sides of the Border in the interests of helping people to understand the impact of deaths on our roads. I compliment RTE, particularly Mr. Charlie Bird, on an interview that was broadcast last evening with a gentleman who is mourning the death of his daughter who was killed in a road accident some weeks ago. I understand that the man in question spoke to Mr. Bird just 48 hours after his daughter was buried. It is right that the harrowing report in question was the lead item on last night's RTE news bulletins. A story about two dogs on drugs was the lead item on the news for a couple of days last week, which cannot be justified in the context of what is going on in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I was impressed by the report on yesterday evening's 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. news bulletins. The comments of the father of a woman who was killed in recent days will remind people of the importance of this issue. He explained what it means to him to have lost his daughter and, more particularly, what it means to his daughter's young child to have lost her mother. Those of us who see children on a daily basis understand the impact such a tragedy would have. Such a striking and harrowing report will probably do more to change driver behaviour than many of the other measures which have been put in place. I compliment RTE on the report and I hope it will continue such an approach to its news output.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I came across a road accident before Christmas as I was travelling from Dublin to County Clare early one morning, just after I had finished my business in this House. As the traffic was moving slowly, I was able to see a priest saying prayers over the body of a dead woman, which had been abandoned on a ditch by the road. For the rest of that day, I thought I would hear reports of what had happened and what was the cause of the accident but it never even made the news. There was not a scrap of information about it in the newspaper the next day. It would be particularly sad if the deaths on our roads, which have such significant consequences for the lives of all concerned, were not deemed worthy of news coverage. It would be wrong for media organisations not to see such accidents as news because they happen so frequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">If the deaths on the roads are kept to the fore by being in the headlines, they will continue to shock people. Given that we depend on news reports for our information, such reports should not omit any mention of the fatalities on our roads. If those of us who listen to "Morning Ireland" each morning start to notice that the first item is usually about a person having died in a traffic accident, slowly but surely that will help us to slow down. When I saw a dead woman on the road as I was rushing to a number of events in County Clare, I took the attitude that it did not matter if I was ten minutes or half an hour late for the rest of the day. We will have some success in this regard only if the media takes the approach I have suggested. The media has an obligation to report road deaths and it is certainly doing it. I compliment RTE on the approach it adopted on last night's news bulletins.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I thank the Minister of State for attending this debate. I am sure she will use her position in the Department of Education and Science to make some proposals in this area.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_416">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera. I am delighted that the Government is taking an increased interest in road safety. That so many people have been killed on our roads in recent years is appalling and depressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I am glad the Road Safety Authority is to be given responsibility for research into road safety. We have been far too casual about this aspect of the matter in recent years. Not much of the considerable amount of road safety research that has been undertaken in Ireland and other countries has been brought to the attention of consumers. We need to tell consumers about the increased risks, not only for drivers and their passengers but also for other road users, which are associated with the use of certain types of vehicles, particularly sports utility vehicles, which have become very popular in Ireland. A considerable amount of international research has indicated that those who drive such vehicles feel they are safer than they would be if they were driving other types of vehicle. There is nothing to substantiate that feeling, however. Not only are the drivers of sports utility vehicles no safer, but they represent far more of a risk to other road users such as pedestrians.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Many reports have highlighted the danger presented to children when they are struck by vehicles with bull bars. Children are small and therefore less visible to the drivers of sports utility vehicles. As such vehicles are much higher than other vehicles, they strike the entire child which means there is no chance of a child being thrown onto the bonnet. It is a serious issue. A woman in Australia who killed a five year old child while driving a sports utility vehicle — she drove over the child without realising she had struck the child — is spearheading a campaign to ban such vehicles from being used within a certain distance of schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Dr. Ciaran Simms, who is a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Trinity College Dublin, and Professor Desmond O'Neill, who is the college's associate professor of medical gerontology, have published a survey, based on information provided by hospitals, of the fate of older pedestrians who are struck by sports utility vehicles. They have found that older people suffer much worse injuries if they are struck by such vehicles because they are usually struck on the upper leg, the pelvis or the chest. Such collisions cause severe internal injuries and are much more likely to lead to death. When people purchase sports utility vehicles, I do not think they understand they are choosing to drive a vehicle that is much more likely to cause serious damage to their fellow road users. It would be a good idea to make the observations of Dr. Simms and Professor O'Neill generally known to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The risk of serious injury to people travelling in a sports utility vehicle is no less than the risk to people travelling in what is described in the United States as a "sedan", or what we would call an ordinary car. A study published by the University of Pennsylvania's school of medicine suggests that parents should be advised that "despite their greater size and weight, SUVs are not any safer than standard sedans for children during a crash because of their increased tendency to roll over". Sports utility vehicles are twice as likely as other cars to roll over as a consequence of their high centre of gravity. The most common circumstances in which children are injured is when they are thrown about, because they are not restrained, when the vehicles in which they are travelling roll over. It should also be noted that side passenger airbags are more likely to inflate in such circumstances. We have known for a long time of the lethal effects on children of front seat passenger airbags. Everyone is advised not to allow any child in the front of a car fitted with an airbag. This survey shows that side airbags also cause extremely serious damage to children. It states that no child under the age of 13 years should be allowed sit in the front seat of a car and that the danger to children in SUVs when unrestrained versus restrained in a rollover crash was of the order of 24.99 and 6.68. That is a huge difference in the injuries one could sustain if one has such a vehicle.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I cannot understand why bull bars have not been removed from cars. I do not see bulls all over the roads of Ireland. I understand they were originally for kangaroos which are also in short supply. Persons driving these cars should be made aware of the dangers to themselves and to other people, pedestrians in particular.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_422">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, to the House. This is a matter that caught my attention some years ago. I was asked to go on the National Safety Council which had decided to draw attention to those in the media who were highlighting the problem of deaths on the roads. I did not realise how much the problem was capable of being solved until I got involved in it. It is capable of being solved. What it needs more than anything else is a sense of leadership at the top. I looked at France which I know quite well. France had horrific problems. At the last election President Chirac said he would put that issue at the top of his agenda and that it was his priority. Once he said that and put it high on the agenda it actually worked and France has dramatically reduced the number of deaths on the road. The behaviour in France used to be totally different.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">If only one message comes out of this debate that we have been tearing ourselves apart with in recent times it is that it needs leadership. I am not speaking only about the Minister who is doing his best, it has to be the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach has got to say this is a priority. What happened in France also happened in Australia. Victoria, in particular, took action. It is interesting to note that recently in Northern Ireland there has been a reduction in accidents and we question why.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I am informed it will cost money to do some of what needs to be done. That is wrong, it is value for money. We can save money in many areas. This is value for money investment. I wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>15 months ago on the topic of value for money. I took the instance of enforcement and changing the attitude of the nation and it is possible to do so. In my own business we saw how the attitude of people changed on the issue of plastic bags. It happened overnight because we behaved differently. The same can happen regarding road deaths. I was in Australia a few months ago and I was taken by the fact that I did not see anybody drinking who was driving. The question did not even arise. I did not see anybody breaking the speed limit. These things depend on enforcement and that is where we are wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">One of the actions we could take, and it is a proposal I made 18 months ago, is to put in place thousands of speed cameras not only on main roads but on side roads and back roads. There is no need for somebody to stand watching them, people automatically take note. If the legislation is enforced there will quickly be an attitude change. We have to change our attitude towards speeding and I believe we can do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">For many years we have been told there are constitutional difficulties in introducing random breath testing. Suddenly we find we do not have a problem any more. The solution was there all the time but we were not determined or committed enough to introduce random breath testing. If we had to change the Constitution we should have done so. It turns out we do not have to change the Constitution, the solution was there all the time. That is the sort of thing that can happen only if there is determination and if we give the matter priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The third issue which was touched upon by Senator Henry is the attitude to seat belts. If we had the experts in here they would say the three issues that are most important are speed, alcohol and the wearing of seat belts. The use of mobile phones is a side issue. If we are determined to address these three issues, and it is possible, we would reduce the problem dramatically. However, none of that will happen without enforcement. It is a question of enforcement and steps are being taken now.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I am not one of those who asks why we did not do it earlier but it looks like something will now happen. It is unfortunate for the parents and families of those who died in recent years that we did not do this in the past but let us grab this opportunity. Let us put the matter high on our priority list and ask the Taoiseach to put it at the top of his agenda as did President Chirac. Then, I believe, it will happen. We are convinced this can be achieved. I know the Department and the Taoiseach's heart is in the right place. Let us ensure it is not just talk but action.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_230">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, to the House and hope she will take our views on board. I wish to put a few simple points on the record. I listened with some care to the points made by my two colleagues who raised issues that can be simple matters. Certainly the higher the vehicle the more likely it is to cause serious injury, as made clear by Senator Henry. The reports are there to prove it.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The issues raised by Senator Quinn are also ones that can be moved forward. I wish to add a few more. Perhaps we can look at a simple issue. The condition of the roads has been mentioned by everybody as an important factor in determining safety. That is a cost issue and I will not develop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">There is another issue that always interests me every time I drive on the Continent. On most of the main highways in France there are two speed limits, a wet and a dry speed limit. It is a simple matter and it is implemented. The wet sign indicates a speed limit of 90 km/h and the dry sign 120 km/h, 115 km/h or 110 km/h. That is the rule. It is sensible and practical. That is another thing we could learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The other issue has to do with side roads. Those of us who have been driving North-South all our lives used to like to get to the Border years ago because there were better roads in the North.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_433">Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_434">We do not find that any more. When we get to the North we find the main roads are narrow. Similarly, in the North if one goes off the main roads the side roads are way ahead of those in the South. That is the difficulty. I know Senator Wilson will have much to say about that given that he lives in a Border county. The difference is clear if one goes on a non-main road North and South. Road conditions are crucial to accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The other issue is the overtaking manoeuvre. The number of people who cannot overtake a car is infuriating. They cannot judge the speed of an oncoming car. With half a mile of road ahead they cannot overtake the car in front. These are people who have full licences. The simple reason for this is that there is no overtaking manoeuvre in the driving test. It would be hypocritical as the test is normally done in a 30 mile speed limit area and they will never get the opportunity to overtake. People should not get a driving licence without being able to show they appreciate the speed of a car and of an oncoming car and that they can overtake with safety. That is an essential requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Minister will not accept the logic of the argument I am about to make and I need a good deal of time to develop it, but I will state it in about four sentences. One in four of the fatalities that have occurred in Ireland in the past year has involved immigrants. Similarly, every year, and over Christmas, we have seen the tragic deaths of Irish people on the Continent. We are driving on the wrong side of the road and that is causing a problem. I have looked very closely at this matter. I spoke to a man from the west of Ireland who was in Sweden on the weekend in 1963 or 1973 or whenever it was that they changed over from driving on the left to driving on the right. I accept that the Swedes are far more disciplined than we are but they did it in one weekend. We should do it, take the pain for a year and move on. We should drive on the right like the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">In terms of drink driving, I would welcome a requirement on all people who run public houses to take responsibility for getting a taxi or a hackney cab for anybody who looks for it. People go to the pub with good intentions of taking a taxi or a hackney cab home but when it becomes difficult they get into their car and drive. It is happening all the time and it is an important issue. This is a small thing which should be taken up with the hospitality industry, as it now likes to call itself.</p>

        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_438">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_439">That Seanad Éireann congratulates the Government on the child care package set out in budget 2006;</p>
          <p eId="para_440">—welcomes especially the new five-year child care investment programme which will support the creation of an extra 50,000 child care places;</p>
          <p eId="para_441">—maintains that the new early child care supplement of €250 per quarter for every child up to the age of six will assist parents further with the cost of caring for their children during those years when expenses tend to be at their highest;</p>
          <p eId="para_442">—notes that the early child care supplement, taken together with the increases in child benefit, which budget 2006 increases to €150 per month, brings the amount a family will receive for each of the first two children to €2,800 per year;</p>
          <p eId="para_443">—supports the policy of an intensification of training arrangements to support quality child care delivery and notes that it is expected that 17,000 child care workers will be trained by 2010; and</p>
          <p eId="para_444">—commends the further extension in maternity leave which will enable mothers of newborn children from 2007 to take six full months of paid maternity leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">As Government spokesman on health and children I am particularly pleased to speak on this innovative approach in response to an issue which demanded attention. I am delighted it has been addressed. I acknowledge the long-standing commitment of Senator White and others on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">This strategy will cover both current and capital spending, costing a cumulative €2.65 billion over the five years 2006 to 2010. Funding for the national child care strategy will be allocated in the Revised Estimates. From April 2006 a new early child care supplement worth €1,000 per year is being introduced for all children under six years. In effect, the supplement will end on their sixth birthday. The supplement will take the form of a direct, non-taxable payment of €250 in respect of each eligible child. Payments will be made every three months, that is, in each quarter. The first early child care supplement payment, covering the second quarter of 2006, will be made in mid-2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">This will provide a major boost to families with young children. It will greatly alleviate the financial burden that many working families face in meeting rising child care costs, while recognising and rewarding stay-at-home parents. It is significant that in the budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has given due recognition to stay-at-home parents. It is unfair to say that such people do not work when they are at home with children. Parents who work in the home are gainfully employed in so far as I am concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">A tax-free allowance of €10,000 has been introduced for those who mind children in their own homes. This is an initiative that has been long awaited and I am delighted the Minister has taken this step. Almost 80% of families paying for child care rely on informal arrangements. This will bring the many experienced and dedicated friends and neighbours performing this function into the tax net. Moreover, it recognises the vital role they play in our community.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Child benefit has also risen by €10 a month. From April 2006, monthly child benefit rates will increase to €150 for each of the first two children and €185 for each subsequent child. Child benefit has risen by 300% since Fianna Fáil came into Government with the Progressive Democrats in 1997. The greatest asset any country has is its people. Our children are the future leaders of the country and will be the bedrock of society. This package is of great importance for that reason. It is not today or yesterday that the need arose for a child care package. The need existed for some time. The Government has recognised that and has taken proactive measures to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">This historic child care package provides both children and parents with choice and support. Budget 2006 proposes an increase in funding for child care training services to train more than 17,000 qualified child care workers from 2005 to 2010. A new multi-annual investment programme is being introduced with the aim of funding 50,000 additional child care places by 2010. This will be over and above the 41,000 places provided under the existing equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP. A total of 26,000 places have already been created since the start of the EOCP and a further 15,000 places are due to come on stream before it ends in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The new national child care investment programme will consist of Government funding with grant aid available to both private and community providers for the building or expansion of child care facilities; and an ongoing current funding system to assist with the staffing and other operating costs in those community facilities that cannot meet the costs from fee income alone and to underpin further development of the role of city and county child care committees. This is an important measure, one which will bear fruit in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The amount of paid maternity leave from employment will increase from 18 weeks to 22 weeks from 1 March 2006. In addition, employees will also be entitled to take an additional four weeks unpaid maternity leave from the same date. In other words, from that date, one can avail of an additional 12 weeks unpaid maternity leave, after paid maternity leave ends. From March 2007, employees will be entitled to 26 weeks paid maternity leave, together with an additional 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave. The rise in housing costs in recent years necessitated both parents going out to work to pay the mortgage and, accordingly, this measure will be of great assistance to them. My wife always worked in the home even though she was a trained nurse. That was our decision and I am glad we took it. This important measure assists the people who cannot avail of that option in getting over a difficult period, especially if there are childbirth or postnatal difficulties. The rate of maternity benefit is set to increase to 80% of reckonable weekly earnings with a minimum weekly rate of €182.60. Previously, maternity benefit was based at 75% of one's weekly earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">We have heard inside and outside this Chamber of the large demand for child care and rightly so. Since 1997, the number of working women has risen by nearly 45% to 810,000. The majority of mothers now go out to work. I have given one of the reasons and there are several more, a main one being the increase's importance in light of the marriage bar some years ago. It was an outrageous insult to women and debarred society from availing of a tremendous level of expertise. I welcome its reversal.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The participation rate of mothers at work is lower among lone parents, who comprise 20% of all families with school-going children. Ireland has one of the lowest rates of lone parent labour market activity at 45%. This is an area that must be focused on and improved. I exhort the Minister of State to take it up as a matter of urgency. I know he will.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The number of births has also increased. The number of children of four years of age or under is expected to increase by 11% in the next ten years. It has been said <i>ad nauseam</i> that, with the drop in Irish childbirth rates and longevity on the increase, we will become an ageing population. This statistic will hopefully reverse that belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">We have introduced the largest increase in child benefit in the history of the State. Since coming into Government in 1997, monthly rates have increased by €93.51 at the lower rate and €115.78 at the higher rate, increases of 246% and 234%, respectively, compared with inflation of 26.9%. Child benefit is a contribution towards the costs of raising children, regardless of a household's income or employment status. It does not distort parental choice about labour force participation and contributes towards alleviating child poverty. If it serves to do the latter alone, it is doing a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The Book of Estimates has provided an extra €18.8 million for the EOCP in 2006. The total spend will be €102.308 million compared with €83 million last year, a substantial increase of over 20%. Since 2000, over €458 million has been approved under this programme, which led to the creation of 26,000 places by June 2005 and funding, when fully spent, is expected to lead to the provision of an additional 39,000 child care places.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">As of June 2005, over 1,700 facilities are receiving funding under this programme. Over one third of its expenditure is in RAPID and CLÁR areas, in which 8,100 new child care places have subsequently been created. Overall, there is a total of over 82,000 child care places compared with 57,000 in 2001. One does not need to be a rocket scientist or mathematician of any great standing to recognise that this is a significant increase.</p>

          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House and happily second the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">It was deplorable and outrageous behaviour by the Opposition, especially the larger party, Fine Gael, to leap up and down and jump around the place for the past number of days, citing figures off the tops of their heads of anything from €50 million to €150 million. It was scaremongering of the worst sort and beneath the dignity of any responsible politician. This sort of behaviour creates racist attitudes. Not for one minute do I believe that Fine Gael or any of its members are racist or have racist tendencies but one should think before one speaks, especially on such matters. There was uproar in the media over Fine Gael throwing out figures it had not substantiated or researched.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Now that I have got that off my chest I will speak to the motion. I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on the substantially increased resources allocated to child care in last December's budget. I will quote from his Budget Statement as we have been accused of making an ill-thought out budget, particularly in respect of child care. The Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_465">Where are the greatest pressure points for parents? How can I be fair to everyone, to both lower and middle income groups and to working parents, to those who are in the tax net and those who are not, to working parents as well as those who make their contribution to society through their work in the home? What is the administratively simplest and most user-friendly system? What is sustainable for the Exchequer? Having carefully considered all the complex issues involved, the Government has developed a five-year strategy to tackle the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">He went on to say one can only do so much in one budget but that this was a major start and he looked forward to continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">It was a major increase, far in excess of inflation. In June 1997, as my colleague, Senator Glynn, has already outlined, child benefit for first and second children was €38. Last December, the Minister for Finance announced that monthly rates were to be increased to €150 for the first and second children and €185 for subsequent children. This is a fourfold increase in child benefit. As the Minister stated in December, this was the first budget wherein child care was seriously examined. I do not care on which side of the fence one is. One must say that this has made and will make a substantial difference. This was only last December's budget and there is another budget to go before the Government will see its term of office end. After our re-election, we look forward to delivering another five budgets, which will have even better child care packages. We are building on everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I welcome the new five-year child care investment programme to create an extra 50,000 places. My adopted county of Sligo, a small county in the west, has seen major investment. A total of €1 million has been provided for state-of-the-art child care facilities in the town itself, creating child care places and bringing in child care personnel to run them. In Senator Scanlon's home town of Ballymote on the outskirts of Sligo, another €1 million has been used for child care development. In Enniscrone, west Sligo, more than €1 million has been spent, for which the people of Sligo are most grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">When I see the figure of €1,000 per year for children under five years of age, I am saddened I did not stop my biological clock. Twenty years ago I had four children under five and I wish that such money had been available. I was a young married mother who gave up work to look after my children. I would have welcomed such income so I envy the young mothers who receive this sum, which will assist in educating and caring for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I am delighted that mothers of newborn children will have six months paid maternity leave from 2007. As a woman and a mother, this is a wonderful initiative. This six-month period can be followed with a further period of unpaid leave. Returning to work and leaving one's child to be looked after by someone else is daunting, particularly with a first child. One wonders if the child will miss the parent. If one can look after the child for nine months, one is leaving a little toddler rather than an infant. This will take the pressure off new mothers who would have had such a draw on their emotions.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_472">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_473">—welcomes the Government's belated and limited recognition of the costs borne by parents in bringing up their children and the need for additional maternity leave;</p>
          <p eId="para_474">—regrets that the Government has not provided for paid parental and paternal leave; and</p>
          <p eId="para_475">—further regrets that the Government's financial package did not include an additional element which would allow access to quality assured early childhood education and care for all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I am delighted Senator Feeney has opened her contribution with an attack on the Fine Gael Party. Senator Feeney is not correct about many matters but she is correct in stating that this five-year plan has been unveiled in the Government's ninth year in office. This is in response to the frustration of taxpayers who have to meet the excessive costs of child care. Having lost two by-elections humiliatingly and having failed to get its message across when it became socialist in September 2004, the Government has resorted to publishing a five-year plan during its ninth year in office. That is the only statement from the Senator that resonates with any truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I wish to address her ill-thought out, juvenile remarks on comments made by my party members and me. When creating its child care package, and specifically the child care supplement, the Government did not factor in the potential claims of a significant number of migrant workers. When RTE, which ran this investigative story, raised the matter the Government was unaware of this potential cost. Subsequently, it conceded that it would have to pay on these claims. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance was referring to assisting people in this country to deal with the excessive costs of child care. That was the rationale behind the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The Taoiseach apologised to our party and effectively withdrew the charge of racist slur but I ask Senator Feeney, who persists in making that charge, to read what was said by the leader of her own party.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I hope I will have more time because of Senator Feeney's rather silly interruption. The question is whether the Government had prepared for, was aware of, and had put in place the mechanisms to deal with this matter in the context of its statement in the Dáil last December. The Taoiseach is correct that a variety of reciprocal arrangements exist in many EU countries. Is there a specific arrangement in place to deal with the payment of €1,000?</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated on Monday evening that the matter would be kept under review. In the context of such a review, will 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 claims be made? Rather than the reactionary, over the top, juvenile remarks of Senator Feeney, the Government needs to be clear on this issue. This is the Government that displayed an inability to deliver the over 70s medical card at three times the original estimate and was wildly inaccurate on pension provisions for those who worked before 1953.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">My party has raised these matters in a rational manner but the Government has responded to this debate in an ugly, silly way. If a racist slur is cast upon me or my party every time a matter of public importance is to be discussed in the manner in which I am debating, it is a sad day for democracy and a new type of McCarthyism has taken over. I appreciate the Taoiseach's clarification of his remarks in the other House yesterday and I request Government Members of this House to be aware of what he stated and to be consistent with his position.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Regarding the Government's self-congratulatory motion, some minor improvements have taken place in child care provision, as announced in last December's budget. I welcome these improvements but many of these measures were made in anticipation of the next general election. It is utterly wrong that hard-pressed taxpayers should pay an additional benefit in kind if their employers provide a cash subsidy towards the cost of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I ask the Government to examine this issue in the Finance Bill. If a progressive employer will provide funding to help meet excessive costs of an employee's child care bill, benefit-in-kind should not be levied. I ask the Government to review rates charged to child care facilities throughout the country. When the Government announced its €1,000 subsidy, child care costs rose in many facilities in Dublin the same week. The manner in which we should deal with commercial rates is to charge at a different level.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The Government should undertake a complete audit of provisions for State agencies, semi-State bodies and Departments as a means of ensuring the public authority and the Government implements its strategies on child care. There is no point in lecturing the private sector if the public sector is not doing enough to provide additional child care places. I ask the Government to commit to such an audit and publish the results.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Sums of up to €800 for two-income families for child care amounts to, in effect, a second mortgage. Not only must we act in terms of a universal provision, we must also do more to help with those additional costs faced by many new families, particularly in areas of new housing. The way to do more is to deliver an additional benefit to those families. I welcome the positive announcements in the budget on the basis that it is a small step by the Government after nine years in office. However, the public will not be fooled by this Pauline conversion and that is the context of our amendment.</p>

It certainly is a self-congratulatory motion and I must agree with Senator Brian Hayes in condemning Senator Feeney's opening remarks. I am surprised she raised it in the manner in which she did. While she went on to state that she believes nobody in Fine Gael is racist, it was her opening comment. If we read the report afterwards she will understand why we are concerned about what she said.

          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_495">I second the Fine Gael amendment. It is about time the Minister of State felt the need to address the child care issue. It is backslapping of the greatest order for Senator Feeney to state what the Government has done. She must remember how long the Government has been in office and wonder why it was not done before. There is no point in all of the time going back over what we did when we were in Government. We stated before that they were different times, as was the case when the Government came into power nine years ago. Time has moved on and I agree that our economy has improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">There was a time, when Senator Feeney and I were much younger and had young children, that the money was not there to provide the type of child benefit that women get today. Senator Feeney stated she envied women today. I am not sure I share that envy. Their needs are as great now as our needs once were. In fact, the needs of young mothers and fathers today are even greater. Many women of my age stayed at home and in many cases they were forced to stay at home. We did not have the costs or stresses in our lives that young mothers and fathers have today.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I acknowledge we have come a long way and much has been done in the budget, but not before time. If we examine the package in the context of our economy, we are doing little and playing catch-up with the rest of the EU. Accepting that somebody can pay up to €500 per month for one child, the budget gives approximately €20 per week towards helping a parent with the costs of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Child care is not only about paying a child minder. A child care package is and must be much greater than that. I urge the Minister of State to broaden the package. Providing money is not good enough. Many parents will be glad of the money but it may not necessarily be spent on the child. What about the early education of the child? We are examining all aspects of the child and not only child care costs. Much more must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">We must recognise and take into account that children have varied and individual needs. An issue of equality is also raised. We recognise that stay-at-home parents have an equal right to this money as mothers who go out to work. The well-off parent receives the same amount as the poorer parent. Many issues must be addressed and improved. The issue of providing quality child care must also be addressed and much more must be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">My secretary told me that apart from an increase in child benefit, the child care package has done nothing for her as a working mother. A single working mother with children over the age of six does not benefit from the payment of €1,000 per year. There is nothing for parents of children in school. Parents must pay for after-school care. There is nothing in the budget to help them. Let us recognise that it is not a panacea for every issue. Much more must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">With regard to the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill I do not want the Minister of State to reply by stating that the Government has improved maternity leave. We took Second Stage of the Bill 12 months ago and it now awaits Committee Stage. The delay is unacceptable. Parents of six and seven year old children contact me and are concerned that their children will be too old and they will not be able to avail of it. Some of them will already have missed out on the opportunity to avail of the Bill's provisions. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that Bill is returned to the House as quickly as possible. I contacted the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and asked it to deal with this issue. No date has been set to do so. I fear it will not deal with it before Easter. I ask the Minister of State to examine the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The National Women's Council of Ireland contacted me regarding the €10,000 tax allowance for child minders. I presume it also contacted the Minister of State. It stated it is a positive initiative to encourage child minders into the formal economy. It is critical that when this measure is introduced child minders will be given the same rights and entitlements as all workers. That is extremely important. A child minder willing to mind three or more children in his or her own home for many years will not receive pension or other benefits on retirement or on falling ill. We must examine this issue and I ask the Minister of State to address the anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I am concerned that the Minister for Finance took the easy option. It was administratively easy to act as the Government did. I can see how one could go down that line. We must now examine the quality of care given to the child and see the value of early childhood education and the opportunities presented to children. It must be available. The Minister of State is aware that for too long in our area community crèches were in danger of closing down if they did not have the finance or were afraid they would not have the ongoing finance to pay the wages of the staff. We must get away from that and ensure there is an ongoing system that will be available to everybody. We must eliminate fears that sufficient funds will not be available from one year to the next. I ask that, instead of clapping themselves on the back, Members of the Government parties get on with addressing the outstanding child care issues. The child care package is long overdue.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I take Senator Terry's point that self-congratulation on the part of Members on the Government benches is not an enjoyable sight, but the fact is that when our Government first took office in 1997 there was no effective child care system or policy. At that time this country lagged behind many of our partners in the European Union in our thinking and in the development of such policy. With the formulation of the first equal opportunities child care programme for the millennium, we at last had a definite Government policy on child care. However, I am always surprised that in contemporary political discourse in the State so many individuals profess to have discovered that child care was an issue when they were canvassing in the counties of Meath and Kildare.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_510">——and I have frequently participated in debates on the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Child care is an important issue that has been to the forefront of Government policy development since 1997. The equal opportunities child care programme was intended to last from 2000 to 2006. In several debates on the programme in this House last year I think everyone agreed that the time had come to take a long-term view of current child care policies, to adopt a more strategic approach to the delivery of services and to meet the current demands of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">As far back as June 2003, the Cabinet committee on children established a high level working group on early childhood care and education that was to consider the options. I was very much involved with the working group as it came under the aegis of the then National Children's Office. The group's terms of reference were "to recommend an integrated national policy on child care and early education which will result in improved co-ordination at national and local level and which incorporates a child-centred approach to service delivery". Therefore, I welcome the emphasis that Senator Terry placed on the importance of a child-centred approach and of incorporating quality measures into the system. I can assure her that a key feature of the child care strategy that the Minister for Finance announced in the budget will be the introduction of early education and quality into child care provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The working group included representatives from the various relevant Departments. In October 2005, the Cabinet committee on children received from the group an options paper that has informed the Government's recent decisions on child care. Essentially all the key players in the child care sector, in particular parents, called on the Government to make greater funding available for child care and to adopt a more cohesive approach to the delivery of child care services. Those two demands were clearly stated in the public debate on child care that took place prior to the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">After considering these matters with great care, in the budget on 7 December the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, announced a national child care strategy for 2006 to 2010. I believe the national child care strategy is a comprehensive and strategic approach by the Government to the emerging needs and the future development of the child care sector. The strategy will stand the test of time and will serve the successor to this Government well.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">It is true that the complexity of the cross-cutting nature of child care policy is sometimes understated. Given the well known difficulties surrounding multi-agency programmes, the location of child care under the remit of a particular Minister or a Department, emerged as a pressing need. We all know the need was addressed when, immediately after the budget, the Taoiseach announced a Government decision to create the office of the Minister for children under the Minister of State with special responsibility for children. I am honoured to have this unprecedented opportunity to develop and deliver policies and programmes that will help to ensure the well-being of all our children. My responsibilities include the issues of child protection and welfare, early childhood care and education; and juvenile justice. The housing together of all these issues in one vision of care, protection and provision for children will empower me to make real change and progress on these vital issues. In recent years as Minister of State I worked across the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science. During this time I was keenly aware of the pressing need for a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to the diverse but fundamentally interlinked child care areas under the remit of these Departments. The office of the Minister for children has been staffed with key officials from these Departments who will bring with them their expertise in each of their areas of child care policy and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">A key element of the new national child care strategy is the child care investment programme, which will run from 2006 to 2010 and be delivered in a strategic way through the new office of the Minister for children. As the new programme came into effect on 1 January 2006, the Government in effect decided to terminate the equal opportunities child care programme before its due date and to replace it with another programme. Unlike its predecessor, the new investment programme is entirely funded from the Exchequer and there is no question of it being co-funded by the European Union. The Government has committed €575 million to the programme over its five-year term. That is substantially in excess of — in fact, it is almost double — the allocation for the previous programme. The Government's decision to create a major new five-year investment programme immediately rather than wait until the expiry of the equal opportunities child care programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to the provision of quality child care. Personally, I was anxious to dispense with the EOCP acronym — I think Senators will agree we have an abundance of acronyms to describe different public programmes — so the new programme is simply called the national child care programme. Its name just describes what it is, but it will no doubt become known as the NCP in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">In any event, the national child care programme aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services grounded in an understanding of local needs. It will build on the previous programme and will incorporate a number of objectives. A key objective is the creation of 50,000 additional child care places, including 5,000 after-school places and 10,000 pre-school places for three and four year olds. The programme also aims to improve the quality of early childhood care and education services, including part-time, full day care, school-age child care and child minding. It will support families, break the cycle of disadvantage and support a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care centred on the needs of the child. In that connection, I have already mentioned Senator Terry's speech, but I ask her to note that the early education side of the Department of Education and Science has been co-located in the office of the Minister for children and put under my devolved direction. That is an important point because whatever child minding arrangements are in place must be informed by the best early education practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The Government has set ambitious targets for the next five years, including the creation of 17,000 additional trained child care personnel. I am committed to ensuring that we meet these targets and objectives in a way that takes account of the needs for pre-school child care, school age child care and for wrap-around services that meet the specific needs of parents and their children. Meeting the targets will require careful planning and incremental development but I am confident I have been given the necessary tools and resources to deliver on them. As Senators will appreciate, the fact that the previous programme was co-funded by the European Union and related to female labour market participation and equality in the workforce meant there were constraints on the types of programme that could be devised under the previous equal opportunities child care programme. Those constraints will not apply to the new programme, which will be funded exclusively by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Additional capital funding was announced in budget 2006 that will enable me to allocate capital grant assistance to groups that address significant child care service gaps. The maximum capital grants available for the building or expansion of child care facilities will be €1 million per facility for community-based, not-for-profit providers. There will be a strong focus on private provider applications as well with a maximum capital grant of €100,000 per facility and a maximum of €500,000 per provider in the case of multiple services in different catchment areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The new national child care investment programme will continue to assist with staffing and other operating costs in community facilities that cannot meet the full costs from fee income alone. In fact, I received many representations about the uncertainty of personnel in the community facilities who were in receipt of staffing grants. Staffing grant assistance under the previous programme is being continued to the end of 2007 to ensure there will be no break in the momentum that has been built up and that the transition to the new programme is a smooth one.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">A key element of the new programme is the decision to deliver it at local level through the city and county child care committees. I have had the privilege of visiting many of the city and county child care committees and I put on record my appreciation of the tremendous work they do. They were established at city and county level under the previous investment programme and have been a very active force at local level. They will identify and meet local child care needs and facilitate greater flexibility in our responsiveness to those needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Even with these new structures in place, it will not always be possible to deal with child care as a discrete administrative area. One example I put to Senators is the need for interaction between infrastructural development and the planning structures and regulations under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In regard to planning issues, I propose to strengthen linkages at national and local levels between the relevant parties, including the planning authorities, the county development boards and the county child care committees. In co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, officials from my office will address local planning authorities shortly to ensure greater understanding of the issues and to foster a co-ordinated approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">For understandable reasons, Senators tend to be very familiar with the operations of local government authorities and I am sure they are aware of the difficulties at local level in regard to the planning of child care facilities. It is important we have a much more co-ordinated approach to this issue and that clear goals are set and clear norms are laid down by officials and authorities.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_524">What will that mean in practice?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_256" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_525">As Senator O'Meara is aware, requirements have been imposed on planning conditions to build child care facilities per a certain number of houses. This has led to circumstances where there are, on occasion, too many child care facilities located in one area while none are located in another. There are also questions in regard to the negotiations which take place between officials and developers about the development of child care facilities and when the requirement can, on occasion, be waived in favour of alternative contributions or approaches. We need a standardised approach to this because as Senators and Deputies have pointed out for some time, there is national need and the forward planning by local authorities must meet and accommodate it. That is why we intend to organise a major conference with local government officials to see how we can progress this forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">One cannot transfer responsibility in this area to a Minister with responsibility for children. It necessarily involves the proper physical planning and development of the country and it is germane to the functions of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I note the motion welcomed the new early child care supplement of €1,000 per annum which is being introduced in respect of all children under six years of age with effect from April 2006. This will be a direct, non-taxable payment of €250 paid per quarter year in respect of each eligible child. The payment is intended to assist parents with the high cost of caring for children, especially in their early years. As will be appreciated, it will take some time to set the administrative arrangements in place for these payments but all parents eligible for these payments can expect to receive the three payments due in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The early child care supplement makes no distinction as to the income or employment status of parents, and this is deliberate. Some might be critical of this feature but the Government believes it is right that parents should have choice when it comes to child care. It is not the role of the State to tell parents which child care arrangements are best suited to their families — rather it is for the State to support them in any such arrangements that are appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">A trend which has worried me in the recent child care debate has been the attempt by some to pit one group of parents against another, which is wrong. Parents, whether they work to support their families while paying for child care or stay at home to mind their children, each in their own way are doing their best for their families and we should not be privileging one set of parents over the other. Both have made sacrifices for their children and in both cases, it is appropriate for the State to offer a contribution towards the costs they incur as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">This week Fine Gael attacked the applicability of the payment to those EU migrants working here and paying Irish taxes while supporting their pre-school children in their home country. This is despite the fact that Irish workers have benefited from similar payments in European Union countries over the years — not only child benefit-type schemes but also payments made explicitly towards the childminding costs of children. This is a requirement under European Union regulations and benefits our citizens employed throughout the EU. Indeed, other European Union countries have made savings as a result of those children remaining in Ireland as we pay for their health and education costs. Of course, we make similar savings when EU migrants support their children back in their home country.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_261" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_535">What is surprising is that yesterday Fine Gael called for this payment to be scrapped and replaced with a voucher system, which would be paid in respect of receipted child care payments. In other words, this would not go to families with stay-at-home parents minding their children. Leave aside for one moment that, on the basis of current case law, my advice is that it is far from clear such a payment would be exempt from EU regulations — that is a complex point of law and not one into which I intend to go here — but the Fine Gael proposal would take this €1,000 payment away from those parents who had made that choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Is that the best solution Fine Gael can come up with? In order to stop a few thousand hard working, taxpaying EU citizens receiving their entitlements, the same as any Irish worker, it would take this money away, not only from them, but from Irish mothers who have put their careers on hold and who have taken a hit on their family income in order to give their children what they consider to be the best start in life. Of course, we know this would never happen. Such a move would be unjust and, in the event Fine Gael ever found itself in Government, it is doubtful any of the many prospective partners which have been canvassed for it would support it in such a step. However, it is disappointing that it is threatening it.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Senator Terry reiterated the claim that the Government's estimated cost of this scheme did not include migrants with children in their home country. As I said, the costing of this payment was based on the take-up of child benefit. Child benefit includes migrants workers' children who remain abroad. Like any payment, the future costs of both payments have always been subject to a number of variables, including future birth rates, the number of children who travel with their migrant parents and the take-up. Both schemes will be monitored but the possibility that take-up will increase in the future should not prevent us making a payment now that will support parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Figures of €50 million and €150 million were plucked out of the air and broadcast by persons who subsequently admitted they did not have a clue how much this would cost, thus adding more heat than light to this debate. Indeed, the figure of €150 million is now stated to have included a possible future increased take-up by migrants of their child benefit entitlements totally unrelated to the introduction of this payment and based on unscientific figures. Quite how the child benefit system could be changed to exclude other EU-based children was not explained by any of the contributors to this debate and I suspect the statement was made without fully thinking it through. If it is now accepted that this entitlement is unaffected by the new payment and cannot be taken away from these workers, this debate would be an appropriate opportunity to say so and to accept this figure was unfounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I regret Senator Brian Hayes said the Taoiseach apologised for me, although I can understand how he was unintentionally misled into saying that by the parliamentary report in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>. Of course, I do not believe any member of Fine Gael in this, or the other, House is a racist and I never suggested any such a thing. The Taoiseach also made it clear that he does not view any member of Fine Gael in that light or context. However, I said that on the basis of the production of this figure of €150 million in a press release circulated by the party, it seemed to be playing on racial card. If the public is told this vast sum of money is about to be spent on persons who reside overseas, to what else is that to amount?</p>

They are vulnerable people whose educational and welfare needs must be met and the State has responsibilities in this regard. However, I am sometimes astonished by the claims made in newspapers. I read interviews with people who have two cars, foreign holidays, a big new house and two children, who want the taxpayer to produce money for them to have more. They should not get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I make a serious point when I state that this tiny planet faces a cataclysm of overpopulation. While I have been making this point for years, eminent scientists now state the same thing. Instead of providing people with tax incentives to have more children, I rejoice in population decline. I include Europe, where people caterwaul about the decline in population, and am delighted the population is dwindling somewhere on the planet, particularly in those countries where the ecological footprint is proportionately much more disastrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">We should think of this issue in a global context and not simply in terms of electoral advantage, without considering it fully. Since I left school, the population of this planet has doubled and it will increase by another 50% within 25 years. We simply cannot cope. The global icecaps are melting and the appalling problem of overpopulation lies behind resource wars, hatred and struggles. As a human and, I hope, a humane person, I have no dislike for families or children. However, they should be born into situations where they are genuinely cherished.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The Minister's speech rang with money. Are we getting good value? I know the Minister and he is a decent and caring family man. However, I have heard the most astonishing amounts, such as €20,000 or €40,000, as examples of what people are obliged to pay to keep a couple of children in a crèche. Why do they pay so much? If one has a number of children in a crèche, where does this enormous sum go? Has anyone conducted a cost benefit analysis to establish what is the most efficient way of spending money?</p>
          <p eId="para_574">As a matter of principle, people should be encouraged to have two children only. It is in the planet's interest. While I am 61 years old and will be gone before we are drowned by the melting icecaps, if the other Members have any real vision of what they are getting their children into, they should take this issue seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The question of child benefits has been turned into a issue of racism or xenophobia. Xenophobia is almost as bad as racism. It means "fear of foreigners", from the Greek. I hope we do not have an unjustified fear of foreigners. Certain groups appear in every race and we should not accept anyone, simply because they are Polish, Yugoslav, black or whatever. We should consider people's quality. If this money is being granted, it should also go to such children, who are still children, whatever their origin. However, I want the payments to be monitored to ensure that the money goes towards the children's welfare. The taxpayer is entitled to know that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I have a point about the wonderful notion of "family" about which I have been preached at for so long. I agree that the family, rightly regulated and filled with love and mutual respect is a wonderful institution. However, in this regard, where is it now? Will people not take any responsibility for their children? I have heard programmes on the wireless in which people stated that the children would be cared for by their extended family and grandparents and then asked who would pay the grandparents. While I am becoming a grumpy old man, I have a certain amount to be grumpy about. Why should the taxpayer pay people to look after their children's children? Everyone appears to want money. I do not have children. I do not want children, because for reasons with which I will not burden this House, it is unlikely that the kind of activities in which I occasionally and sporadically engage will generate children.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_591">I am not accusing the Minister of State in this regard. There have been accusations outside the House to that effect. The Minister of State should note that I am also allowed to make statements in the House. I do not think any of those remarks was meant to be racist. It was that they were considering whether this accounting exercise had been properly carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">There is quite a bit to be said about vouchers for child care. I cannot go back on this now, seeing as for years I asked the former Ministers for Finance, Deputy Quinn and Charlie McCreevy, and the current Minister, Deputy Cowen, to introduce them stating that they would be a good way of ensuring that what money we were giving for child care was being spent on child care. Senator Norris is correct in mentioning the money side of this being the most important matter but of course the most important matter is to get women back to work as fast as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The early care of the child is not being given sufficient attention. While I acknowledge the importance of the extension to maternity leave, we know that this is an extraordinarily important time of the child's life, not just for bonding with the mother but also to encourage breast-feeding. We have made efforts in this direction and in ten years the proportion of mothers breast-feeding when they leave hospital has risen from 30% to 44.5%. However, 66% of mothers from the professional class and those with third level education will leave hospital breast-feeding whereas 21% of those from disadvantaged backgrounds will leave hospital breast-feeding. We are still not giving enough support to mothers when they leave maternity hospital, where a considerable amount of work is put into this issue, but there are overworked public health nurses trying to continue it.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">We need to do more to make this seem a positive aspect of women's life rather than tolerate the sort of remarks that are sometimes made about women who breast-feed. I was grateful on two occasions recently to find that fine big children of six months were continuing to be breast-fed. I was on the Enterprise to Belfast recently, when the train broke down at Poyntzpass for three and a half hours. There was no question of bottles being heated and I was glad that the child opposite me was being breast-fed.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">On another occasion on a flight from London with Aer Lingus, where there was still some idea of public service for passengers, a child was putting up a fierce fight with his mother. She told me that she was trying to wean him and I replied by asking if she could not wait until we got to Dublin to try. She obliged which made for a much more peaceful journey for all on the aeroplane.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government for what they have done but again add their slogan that there is a lot more still to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_597">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion. This is just one of a series of debates in this House on the issue of child care and early childhood education. It is both commendable and significant that this is the case. Child care continues to be a topic that challenges, poses questions and in some ways divides us. When I first contemplated the motion before the House, it occurred to me that it might be less divisive than those in the past. I expected the usual cries from the Opposition of, "Is this the best Senator Minihan can do?" However, in discussing the child care package set out in the budget, I optimistically expected some harmonious support for the latest positive steps taken by Government. Unfortunately, I was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">One element, in particular, the early child care supplement, has become a topic of some heated discussion in recent days. Of course some of this heat is generated by large amounts of hot air emanating from some quarters. I will turn to that specific issue in a few moments.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I congratulate the Government, and the Ministers responsible in particular, on the child care package set out in budget 2006. While may congratulations may be seen merely as expected and customary, I would point out that many interest groups, employer groups and charities have also welcomed recent developments. I could list at length the groups welcoming the measures announced in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">However, it was the reaction of parents, rather than interest groups, that I watched out for most keenly after the Budget Statement. Comments from parents include the following: "The budget represents the most equitable way [they] could have done it", "I think the idea of allowing people to earn €10,000 without paying tax is excellent", "The maternity leave helps people who are working and the early child care supplement helps everybody", and "The €10,000 helps people in the home because they can probably take another kid in while they're minding their own". This is the context in which our debate should take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Of paramount importance is the fact that action on child care is child centred. We should not lose sight of this fact as we discuss the recent budget measures. Furthermore, we should recognise that no single party, from either side of the House, has a monopoly of wisdom on child care. There have been many considered and important policy papers on this issue, particularly, but not exclusively, in the run-up to the budget. I am heartened by the amount of work that was put into contributions to the debate made by all parties, interest groups and the public. That effort should be acknowledged and placed on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Moving to the points raised in the motion, the Progressive Democrats are particularly supportive of the new five-year child care investment programme which, as we have heard, will support the creation of an extra 50,000 child care places. As Members of this House will be aware, my party and I have long stated the belief that increased supply is a key element in reducing child care costs. The Government is to be commended on adopting a partnership approach to implementing the programme. This will provide the essential framework within which Government will deliver on its commitment to quality child care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The child care investment programme is but one part of the co-ordinated and strategic approach taken by the Government, to be administered by a single office under one Minister. The establishment of the office of the Minister for children provides a new and indispensable focus on ways of delivering the best services for children. This is to be warmly welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Moving to the second element of the motion, the one I referred to earlier, the new child care supplement of €250 per quarter for every child up to the age of six is an important step in assisting parents further with the cost of caring for their children, particularly, as the motion states, during the time in a child's life when expenses tend to be the greatest. We must acknowledge that this direct payment of €1,000 a year, available equally to all parents regardless of whether they work, for each child up to his or her sixth birthday, is a truly significant measure, not just in itself but also because when combined with the increases in child benefit, now €150 per month, a family will now receive €2,800 per year for each of the first two children.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">This represents real progress and real support for parents across the country. Despite the help it provides to parents, the early child care supplement has become an issue that greatly concerns Members opposite. Indeed, Senator Brian Hayes of Fine Gael is reported to have concluded that if even one third of the estimated 166,000 accession country workers registered to work here claim the child benefit and new child care payment, the extra cost to the State could reach €150 million. The criticisms appear to be based on the cost and the belief that this was a surprise to Government and that this supplement was only meant to cover child care costs in this country. I wish to address each of these briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">First, Senator Brian Hayes and Fine Gael are almost right in that some 160,000 people from accession countries have been issued with PPS numbers since May 2004. However, the number of workers actually still residing here is likely to be smaller. In fact, in contrast to the widely varying high numbers being bandied about by Fine Gael, just 300 accession state workers are in receipt of child benefit in Ireland for children living in their home country. Despite a further 2,000 claims being processed, it is obvious that in terms of cost, the Opposition has again proven itself rather suspect when it comes to the national accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The second point is the intimation from the Opposition that this issue came as some surprise to the Government and, perhaps, even that the measure was not properly costed as a result. The precise topic was discussed with the Department of Social and Family Affairs two months prior to the budget. Furthermore, receipt of the supplement is based on receipt of child benefit. The budget figures were based on the total number of recipients of child benefit, which includes migrant workers. Unfortunately for the Opposition, this is another paper argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The third claim is that the supplement was only meant to cover child care costs in this country. The new early child care supplement is intended to assist parents with the cost of caring for their children and it is not exclusively for child care or child minding costs. The nature of the payment means it may be spent on other costs. Even, for example, if a parent has to live in one country but his or her children remain in school in another, he or she still has to bear a cost of caring for them. It is, therefore, not that complicated. Ireland should honour its commitments under Regulation 1408/71, which is concerned with the EU social security schemes and the free movement of persons. Irish people have benefited from this system for 30 years, availing in other countries from benefit systems more generous than those we could ourselves put in place in the past. Thankfully, under this and the previous Governments, our economic development has been such that roles have been reversed and to suggest this supplement should not be paid to people from other member states, when we have availed of reciprocal arrangements in those states for decades, smacks of something unpleasant. The regulations are in place to protect the social security rights of persons moving within the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">It is imperative that the correct training arrangements are put in place to support the delivery of the type of child care all Members seek for parents. The motion notes that it is expected that 4,000 or more child care workers will be trained annually over the next five years. While this is necessary and welcome, it must be properly managed and administered. I add the voice of the Progressive Democrats to those calling for the maintenance and development of best practice in child care. As I stated on budget day in this House, in contrast to approaches proposed by Opposition parties, in so far as a coherent policy can be discerned, the Minister considered all family configurations and choices. I, and the Progressive Democrats, have long made clear in our policy documents that we support increasing child care supply, choice for families and extended maternity leave. It is in this context that I support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important matter. We have a proud record of keeping this issue high on the political agenda and, with the exception of this debate, of generally reaching a consensus on what needs to happen regarding child care. I very much regret the tone of the debate in the past few days during which one element of the issue has been politicised unnecessarily. That has not contributed to the debate but, hopefully, we have moved past that and we can focus on the core issues in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">With regard to the Government's package, I welcome the early child care supplement, as it goes some way towards meeting the proposal in our policy document, which was published last October. However, we proposed a payment of €50 a week whereas the Government proposes a payment of less than €20 a week. While this represents a significant divergence, the principle is agreed. Having examined the issue, the Labour Party considered that a universal payment was the best way forward, similar to the Government proposal. When one is committed to the care of children, one does not want to create an unnatural divide between parents who work outside the home and those who work within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The Government missed an opportunity in the budget. While, as the Minister of State pointed out, the budget delivered on a number of child care issues, the Government could have gone much further and I regret it did not do so. The Government's response was limited but the Minister of State made a virtue out of his interest in child care while in office. He has attended the House on a number of occasions to debate the issue and he has been erudite and articulate but a number of his colleagues in the Cabinet only woke up to the urgency and importance of this issue when they arrived on the doorsteps in counties Kildare and Meath. That was unfortunate because, clearly, they were not listening to him. Perhaps, if they had, we might have moved further down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Government parties have been in office since 1997 but the equal opportunities child care programme only came into operation in 2000. It has been a great programme and I acknowledge the contribution of Sylda Langford in developing and administering the programme as well as she has. The programme has made a difference in many communities, including my own in Nenagh, where a state-of-the-art community child care facility was built with the aid of considerable funding under the programme. However, like many others, this facility is struggling because of the cost of staffing. Despite using 17 community employment scheme workers, all but one of whom are women and all of whom are benefiting greatly as a result of their involvement, the crèche continues to struggle. I have visited crèches in disadvantaged areas, which need more public support. This is where our approaches diverge.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Investment in early childhood care and education, particularly in disadvantaged areas, is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and disadvantage. If good quality pre-school education is provided, it will make a difference to the children and families involved. The Competitiveness Council published a report two years ago, in which it pointed out that, despite our economic success, the rate of early school leaving among teenagers was as high as ever. While in the 1980s the drop-out rate might have been put down to bad economic circumstances and so on, that is no longer the case. The council pleaded for the provision of a pre-school education infrastructure and I was disappointed the budget made no provision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Minister of State referred to the provision of 10,000 pre-school places. How are they supposed to be delivered? Who will deliver them? Will existing private sector facilities provide the places or will community pre-school facilities be involved? Unless pre-school education is available to all children, not only to the 10,000 referred to by the Minister of State or those whose parents can afford it or live near a Montessori school, a significant opportunity will be missed. We will fail in our duty to all the children of the nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I very much welcome the proposed establishment of an office of the Minister for children. Child care provision badly needs to be co-ordinated but we have known that for years. It will finally happen and that is great but it is less than 18 months to the election and, therefore, we will believe the Taoiseach for the moment. I hope the office will be well established by the time the election is called. It will take time to co-ordinate everything and to roll out the office but children cannot wait.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I was disappointed that nothing was done about flexible working or paid parental leave. The take-up of parental leave is low because people cannot afford to take unpaid leave. As Senator Terry pointed out, the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill was dealt with in this House a year ago. I had a conversation at that time with a woman in Nenagh who read in the newspaper that the new parental leave provisions would be in place by the following summer. I said I was sure it would be the case because the Bill was in the Seanad. The Bill was debated in the usual efficient manner in this House this time last year, but it is now in the Dáil. I hoped it was in the Dáil because the Government had plans to introduce some element of paid leave. However, this is not the case, which is a pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I am pleased that the Minister referred to planning guidelines. I am considering this aspect because I am trying to get my head around what is going on. Even though all these planning applications include crèches, when the development is built there is no crèche. I agree with the Minister of State that one does not need a crèche in every corner in a town the size of Nenagh or Thurles. However, the Government put the regulations in place for a reason and something is not working. The Minister of State is using language around linkages, co-ordination and so on but I would like to see what this will mean in practice. A conference will be taking place in the near future to which I look forward, because much needs to be done in this regard. I spoke to a woman recently who is operating a crèche out of her private house, which is not satisfactory, and who would like to have a purpose-built crèche. While this woman wants a purpose-built crèche, developers are just not building crèches. There is something wrong somewhere. It is correct that the role of the county child care committees is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The phrase has been used "A lot done, more to do". I would say "A limited amount done, a huge amount left to do". We do not have in place the proper infrastructure. It is a case of putting a bit in here and there and hoping it will look like an overall co-ordinated plan. I have my doubts as to whether this will happen. The proposal is still lacking. What has been done is welcome but it is very limited.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_620">I am pleased to contribute to this debate. It is good that the issue of child care, which we have debated on many occasions in the past, is being debated again in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The first aspect I welcome is having one person in charge of child care and children, and the upgrading of the position to Minister for children. This will address some of the concerns people had at different times that there was no joined-up thinking in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">As Senators will be aware, I have had many difficulties in recent months in regard to the issue of child care and what I saw as a lack of attention and radical initiatives in the area. I welcome the initiatives being put in place by the Minister, Deputy Cowen. They are a move in the right direction, which I would like to acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I wish to focus on a number of issues that have not been addressed so far. The first aspect to which Senator O'Meara referred is working parents. If one carried out a survey of mothers and fathers, particularly mothers, one would find that what they would like most is more time with their children. They would like to be able to get home to do the homework with their children and to attend school plays. They would like not to be under constant pressure. Parents would like to be able to provide a house, car and so on for their children so that they can have the best education, avail of the best after-school facilities and learn music, art, drama and so on. People accept that two parents may need to work because parents, including mothers, are entitled to a career.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Government must put in place the kind of structures that facilitate this way of life, which may be for a limited period. My children range in age from six to 11. I have missed a lot of time with them because I have not been at home to help them with their homework. Fathers and others might think that I am lucky. It is awful not to know what one's children are doing in school. It breaks one's heart. All parents want is time, which must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I plead with the Minister of State to introduce job-sharing and flexible working hours. Even though he might say there is job-sharing, he should visit small and medium sized businesses in the private sector which have huge problems in this regard. I run a business and we had to introduce initiatives in this area. Were it not for the fact that I understand how these women feel, as a small business, we would not have decided to accept that cost. It is very difficult to run a business with job-sharing and flexible working hours, particularly if one is involved in the service industry and is trying to support services from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. How does one deal with the additional cost of employing and training people and managing two or three people who are doing the one job?</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Supports should be made available to organisations on a daily and weekly basis. I pleaded with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, when he was in this House. Obviously he was not interested in what I had to say. He was too upset that I was frank with him. Some of the money being put into child care places should be put into a pilot scheme. The Government should say to small organisations that it will provide a grant if they introduce initiatives that would make life better for parents working in the organisation by allowing them to job-share. Businesses should be given grants to train two people to do the one job or to provide for flexible working hours and so on. They should be given grants to put in broadband and to put a computer in homes which would allow parents not to have to come to work until 10 a.m. and to be able to leave again at 3 p.m. This works very well in America where it is called "moms' hours", "dads' hours" or "parents' hours".</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Something must be done about the women and men whose employers cannot allow them the flexibility and freedom which exists for workers in the public sector. The officials in the Minister of State's Department have access to three-day and four-day weeks because they can take parental leave on one or two days a week. Small business cannot afford this. It is not the way things are in the real world. We must create an environment in the real world whereby the Government will support businesses which contribute to the economy, paying their taxes, PAYE and PRSI to provide flexible working hours for the men and women who work for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">We can no longer ignore the need for paid parental leave. I welcome the extended maternity leave, which makes a significant difference to mothers. For a mother not to have to return to work until her baby is seven or eight months old makes a huge difference. They have finishedbreast-feeding, seen their child's first teeth cut and are getting into a sleeping pattern. It makes a huge difference if the baby is old enough and sturdy enough to go into a crèche or to someone else's house to be looked after. It gets rid of the guilt feeling of which we are all aware. I am sure fathers suffer from it just as much as mothers.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Parental leave should be provided for parents who are working, which would be easy if one were earning lots of money. It would be easy for me to take parental leave. I would not even notice the drop in income because I would be saving 40% of my tax and I would have fewer expenses. However, low paid workers and families on the average industrial wage of €30,000 or €40,000 a year, cannot afford parental leave. In this respect, mothers and fathers lose out but, most important, the children lose out.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">If we leave any legacy in this House, it should be as follows. First, all of the parties should get together and instead of using it as a political football, we should strive for all-party consensus on the issue. We all have great ideas. We all want to make a better world for children, therefore, let us go into the next election and not fight each other on our child care policy. We should have a common acceptable ground that will make sense and make a difference. There should be all-party consensus on this issue. We had it previously in regard to certain referendums and this proposal is even more important than referendums.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">We need to be united in our approach to this issue. We should not fight over it, take pot shots at each other or say one party is better than another parties in its approach. None of us is better than any other; we are parents and adults and at some stage or in some way we will all be involved in Government. I would like us to be united in our approach to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">My message to the Minister of State is that I welcome that his position has been upgraded and that he has been made more powerful in the Cabinet. It is a marvellous step forward. I also welcome the child care measures introduced in the budget. If as a result of those we have to pay €1,000 to the children of parents from Poland or any of the other EU member states who are working here, that does not matter. The issue is about children. I ask my colleagues in the House not to make this issue a political football. My children are too precious to me and I know other Members' children are too precious to them to do that. We should strive for all-party consensus on this issue. If we are united on this issue when we go to the electorate, it can decide on all our other policies, but child care is too important an issue on which to divide the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">When canvassing in the Kildare by-election, the question of child care cropped up on practically every doorstep and that was also the case in County Meath. That was a barometer of child care being an issue in other constituencies. Therefore it was no surprise that given the hammering the Government received in both by-elections, the Minister for Finance at last began to address the child care issue. Typical of its response to the health crisis, the Government believes throwing money at the issue will solve the problem. The Government started to address the problem by examining it strictly from an economic viewpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The main focus of child care should always be on the child having an appropriate curriculum, which is stimulative and developmental for the child. There appears to be no Government policy on the standards and quality of child care. The vast majority of child care workers are not vetted. I read recently in a newspaper the heading "How sure are you that your child is safe?" This is also a cause of concern to many parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Government has no idea of the quality of child care in the unregulated sector in particular, which is not open to inspection. Recent reports from the HSE are worrying when one considers that regulation breaches such as inadequate security on doors and toxic materials being left within the reach of children were found in some child care facilities. It is vital that these inspection reports are published in order that all parents are fully aware of the status of the facility in which they have placed their child. It is essential that the safety of children is paramount in all such facilities. Parents must know that their child is safe, secure and happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">In the Government's policy there is no link to quality and no recognition of the value of the quality of early childhood care and education for all children. Without this link the child care supplement, as it is called, is really only child benefit by another name. When it comes to child care and early education, quality matters. For children, it is an investment in their healthy growth and development; for the care provider, it offers meaningful work; and for society, it has measurable gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The Government has missed an opportunity to develop the pre-school sector in particular. We still remain one of the worst countries in Europe for pre-school provision. We welcome the €1,000 supplement but it is not enough on its own. I stress that what is missing is the vital link, supporting the care and early education of children inside and outside the home. We encourage the Government to take on board many more of the Fine Gael proposals on child care rather than to put a spin on matters, as it tried to do this evening, which is most unedifying.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">As far back as budget 2000, Fianna Fáil and the PDs were lamenting the dramatic rise in child care costs and the huge burden it placed on families. It took them until this year to get around to doing something about it. We should be clear that it is not the nation's children or the nation's family that roused the Government to act on child care, it was votes. The Government had a change of heart on child care. That did not take place on the road to Damascus but on the byroads of the N2 and N7 and the estates in counties Meath and Kildare. That is where the Government had its change of heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The primary focus of child care should always be on the child. I welcome that the Government has belatedly made a start on addressing the child care crisis. "A lot more to do" is definitely an understatement.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I had not intended to participate in this debate because our party's spokesperson on the issue, not only in the Seanad but nationally, contributed and, as always, her delivery was sensible, rational and far from partisan. That is not to say my contribution will be any different.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">There are a few points to be made, however, in the light of the controversy about the early childhood supplement and the fact that the children of immigrants here, who are living in the immigrants' home country, will be paid the supplement and that there is a reciprocal arrangement in place. Viewing this from outside the House, one sees the Government making a virtue out of something that perhaps it had not thought about it. I do not know whether that is true but I know that the evidence until now was that there was no great concerted effort to inform the approximately 100,000 or 150,000 immigrants in the country that these reciprocal arrangements existed. I am not aware of literature in Polish advising our new and welcome immigrants that all these benefits are available to them. However, I am aware that recent reports, extracted from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, about the conditions in which the children of asylum seekers have to live, in some of the hovels which is the best way to characterise how they were described, have not shown much of this warmth and compassion for recently arrived new residents in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I wish to put a scenario to the Minister of State, in his capacity as the new super Minister with responsibility for children. If we accept, which we do and should, that we have an obligation to the children of those who have come to work with us, assuming that at some stage in the immediate future we will try to ensure that workers who come here get the same rights as Irish workers and that those rights are enforced, I cannot help guessing, without evidence, that there are a considerably greater number of civil servants diligently checking out the claims for child benefit of immigrant workers than there were ever available to check out the working conditions of our immigrant workers. I am sure there are many more than 21 civil servants involved in investigating all these claims for child benefit. It is correct that they should investigate them, but it appears that the enthusiasm for making sure that nobody claims a benefit to which he or she is not entitled as an immigrant worker is far greater than the enthusiasm for making sure that immigrant workers who are here are working in conditions that are the same as those of Irish workers, not to mention being required, either by an ungenerous welfare system or by a lack of knowledge of their rights, to perhaps work at lower rates and then contribute to the significant wage degradation that many trade unionists and many of the rest of us believe has begun to happen. I would love to hear from some Minister about the campaign the Government is about to launch to ensure all our immigrant workers know they are entitled to €1,000 per annum in respect of their children under the appropriate age in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania or elsewhere. I look forward to hearing someone on the Government side describe the campaign, which I am sure will be launched in many languages through the labour exchanges, IBEC and similar organisations. It is obvious that the Government wants us to believe that its policy in this regard is rational and well thought out and that it knew this issue would arise. I note that an official said the relevant authorities were processing 2,000 claims. His statement that there will probably be a few more claims, now that the matter has been publicised, represents an admission that it has not been publicised up to now. Where was the generosity when nobody knew about this matter? Is generosity something one adds on when one is caught out? That is what I suspect in this instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">I join Members on all sides of the House who have welcomed in broad terms the Government's child care initiative that was announced in the budget. I am sure the House will endorse the comments which have been made about the new office of the Minister for children. The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has brought the various disparate elements of child care provision, as we have known it over the last seven or eight years, together under the aegis of a single office. Those of us who are involved in the child care sector recognise not only that the Minister of State is now at the top of the pyramid but also that the expertise which has been available within the equal opportunities child care programme since the mid-1990s has been transferred to the new office. I wish to express my personal appreciation and continuing support for Ms SyldaLangford, an outstanding public servant who has been driving child care policy at national and regional level and will continue to do so in her new role. My comments in that regard should not be seen as casting a reflection on any of the other fine people who are operating within the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">As someone who made the case for a child care facility in my home county at a time when such a proposal was not popular in County Leitrim, I have a particular reason to thank Ms Langford. I advocated the development of a facility to cater for between 60 and 100 children, in a town of 800 people that is in a catchment area of 2,000 people, in the context of the imminent arrival in Carrick-on-Shannon of MBNA, which is now the largest employer in County Leitrim. Many people at national level thought the proposal was pie in the sky and many people at local level thought it was overly ambitious. I am pleased to say that Ms Langford and her officials supported from the outset the development of the community-based facility which is now up and running. The facility, which missed out on previous allocations of money, will receive €400,000 for a further extension under the most recent allocation that was announced just before Christmas. Some 105 children are catered for in the facility during the day and between 20 and 30 children are on the waiting list. It emerged at a board meeting earlier this week that there is growing demand for an after-school service, like similar services being provided across the country. That is an indication of the level of demand in what is perceived to be a rural area.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I endorse much of what was said about the need for flexibility to be built into the working day. As someone who is involved in the management committee of the National Economic and Social Forum, I am aware that the Irish Business and Employers Confederation has been making negative noises in that regard. The confederation does not seem to be fully on board. Now that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is driving this policy, I expect that the industrial and commercial sectors will issue a positive response. Greater flexibility would benefit those sectors as much as it would benefit the economy as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I agree with Senator Cox that mothers want to work, but I also believe that mothers want to be mothers. Some mothers who have to cope with the competing elements of their lives — their costs are increasing, for example, because they have to travel greater distances to work — would like to be at home for part of the day. I ask the Minister of State to address this key area by trying to change the industrial law in this regard. Many women in the new Irish society in which we live are beginning to find that the Celtic tiger has drawbacks as well as benefits. I referred earlier to the proposed extension of after-school care services in Drumshanbo, which was supported by many parents who wanted their children to be looked after from the moment they were dropped at the child care centre at 8 a.m. until they were collected at 6 p.m. In other words, the children did not see their parents between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. It was time for them to go to bed by the time they got home. While I accept there are some harsh economic realities to be borne in mind, I do not believe that is what this country should be about. I do not wish to detract in any way from the genuine efforts of parents who are trying to make ends meet. I understand they have to travel long distances in gridlocked traffic and pay high house prices. Something is going to give in our society if this continues. We will not leave a positive legacy if we do not address the matters which have been highlighted by Senator Cox and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I am pleased about the rapid expansion in the number of child care places. There are 50,000 such places at present, including 5,000 after-school places and 10,000 pre-school places. The upskilling of child care workers is also a positive development. Some 17,000 additional child care personnel have been recruited. I was also pleased by the Minister of State's reference to what I understand to be the maintenance of the social economy. I welcome the flexibility that has been built into that over the last few weeks. I know from my experience with the child care facility in Drumshanbo that the social economy is vital for its continued success. The Minister of State has said the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained until 2007. The social economy is vital if we are to continue to provide a high quality of child care services in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">As chairman of the County Leitrim child care committee, I would like to outline what the committee is doing. In 2005, it assisted 32 child care facilities by providing information, training, network and developmental support. The facilities in question provided 97 services to parents, including nine full day care services, 29 play group services, 22 after-school services, one sessional montessori service, one drop-in crèche, 24 summer programmes and 11 parent and toddler groups. The committee also provided supports to home-based childminders and potential childminders. The committee operates under the equal opportunities child care programme, which has provided €6.7 million to County Leitrim to date. Some €5.8 million of that funding has been allocated to a mixture of community groups and private provider child care facilities. Almost 70 headline projects are under way in the county, in areas like transport, childminding development grants, summer scheme grants, pre-school capital grants and after-school grants. The statistics I have outlined constitute the best answer I can give anyone on the other side of the House who wishes to criticise the Government's child care policy.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_653">I thank Senator Mooney for sharing his time with me. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well with his new responsibilities. I have spoken in the House about child care on three or four occasions over the past year. On the first two or three occasions, I called for five things to be delivered on. First, I asked for overall responsibility for the entire child care sector to be given to a single Cabinet Minister, but I am happy that a Minister of State has been given these duties. It is a welcome move. I ask the Minister of State to furnish Senators with a copy of the flow chart in the new office so we can understand how it will work. I assure him that everyone involved in this area has given a great welcome to the appointment of Ms SyldaLangford to her new position. People have great trust and confidence in Ms Langford. The second thing I spoke strongly about in this House was the need for extended maternity leave. I thirdly asked for funding for parents, whether they are at home or in the workplace, to be increased. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that all those things have been done. I welcome the progress that has been made, which is outlined in the main motion before the House. I do not have any difficulty with that, other than to state that, as a matter of course, Governments should not table motions congratulating themselves. To seek support for such a motion is a fairly serious political error. It is better to be congratulated without having asked for such congratulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I feel equally strongly about two further issues which have been raised in the Fine Gael amendment. It is a mistake not to provide for paid paternity leave and extended parental leave. The fourth thing I asked for was that parents should benefit from some form of support when they are on parental leave. I ask the Minister of State to look closely at the fifth thing I asked for, which has already been discussed by Senator Cummins. We need to have trust and confidence in the safety of the system. When parents leave their children in supervision, they should have confidence in the facility in question, regardless of whether it is located in a school, a playschool or a pre-school or whether it is provided by a community group or a group of parents. We owe it to parents to give them such confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">As a priority I ask the Minister of State to find a way of co-ordinating qualifications. A person may be a teacher, a classroom assistant, a community worker or a person may have a child care qualification. However, there should be a clear vetting arrangement so that people would know the level of qualification. They do not all have to be the same. The whole question of choice is crucial in this area. People should be able to make the choice whether they want to send their child to a pre-school, a school, play-school, community group or whatever. All those choices should be available and they should not be in competition with each other. I ask the Minister of State to ensure the vetting of qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I disagree with the idea that these places can ever be self-sustaining and pay for themselves. That will not happen. It will take more money. The point made by Senator Mooney is correct. In fact, I could give other examples even from his constituency. The Life Start office in Sligo is extraordinarily successful also and there are a number of areas in Monaghan and Cavan of which I am aware. They are doing extraordinary work and the variety is attractive.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_658">This is my final point. I welcome certain issues and ask that the questions in the Fine Gael amendment that parental and paternal leave be paid for be answered and that the qualifications be vetted. There can be all sorts of qualifications. Whatever the qualification, we should know that a person has done a course and what is their level of experience. Parents should know that when dropping off their kids. Money will have to be used to pay some of these people. Government talks are beginning tonight or tomorrow in Government Buildings. People working in these areas should also have the opportunity of being benchmarked. They are providing an extraordinary important community service. We need them and cannot get on without them. This is a welcome move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">In terms of how I deal with my position on the motion and the amendment, I will vote for the Fine Gael amendment because I am clear that the two issues it seeks are things I want. In the event of a second vote, I will support the amended motion, whatever that might be.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">I thank the Minister of State for coming in to respond to the debate. I thank Members on all sides for their contributions. In particular, I am delighted we have a child care programme to debate. As I said in my earlier contribution we are speaking about an important section of society, namely, the leaders and pillars of future society. However, I omitted to mention earlier the issue of responsibility. In the first instance, parents have responsibility for their children. That is an issue that has to be borne in mind. An issue I have raised <i>ad nauseam </i>in public life is that young children, <i>de facto</i> teeny boppers, are on the streets of our towns and cities at all hours of the night. When people of that tender age fall into the hands of the proverbial Fagins of Dickensian fame there are no marks for guessing what they get up to. It is a fact that children of a young age are involved in drug dealing in certain areas and that is a worrying factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The measures that have been provided in the budget and that have been discussed here today are of particular importance. Apart from helping the family in an overall sense, it gives an important section of society, namely women, an improved role. As a result of what was the tradition up to 25 years ago when women in professions and others areas, my wife being one, decided to marry they had to vacate their positions. While that position has been reversed in the interim there is an issue that has to be corrected for people of that time. I appreciate that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, have accepted that wrongs have been done but that is a debate for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I am delighted that this motion on child care is before the House and that we have debated it. Some worthy comments and proposals have been made. I would remind the Opposition that jealousy will get it nowhere. It is this Government that has done the job and will continue to do it. I revert to some of the comments made by colleague, Senator Mooney, pertaining to what is available in his county. That is a prime example of what can be done in the area of child care. There is also the whole area of child abuse. While we debated that issue in the debate on the Ferns Report, as elected Members and as citizens we must cast ourselves in the role of the nosey neighbour if we have the slightest hint of suspicion that a child is being abused.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_325">
            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_729">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. I submitted this matter in the aftermath of a meeting with parents in Letterkenny, which is home to the Letterkenny branch of dyslexia workshops. Over 55 parents comprise the branch. They set up this workshop in light of deficits in the special needs area. They found that their children are not being catered for in primary and secondary schools in terms of facilities to meet their specific dyslexic needs, even though it is clearly stated in the guidelines of the Department of Education and Science that children with dyslexia have a specific learning disorder that should be met in terms of learning or resource support in some form. However, this is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The main issue I wish to highlight is that many parents, since the need has not been identified at primary school level, must get private assessments. As the Minister of State is aware — I do not have a clue about the level of fees in the greater Dublin area — some parents in County Donegal pay upwards of €420 for private assessments, without which they will not get into the workshop in Letterkenny. The system is inequitable and there are discrepancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">In terms of special needs, there is an outcry from parents throughout the country, not just in County Donegal — I only cite Letterkenny as one example — for the Department of Education and Science to acknowledge the fact that dyslexia is a special need and requires resource support and not to pass the buck to the schools. The Department decides issues of funding and provision of resource support. Principals and boards of management must take the heat from parents of children who have dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The reply by the Minister of State will be of interest and I hope that, down the line, the clustering system in general for special needs and resource learning will be addressed in rural and peripheral areas. Many schools in rural areas, such as Inishowen and Fanad, do not meet the specific requirements and needs of children with general special needs. It is a resource issue. The Department of Education and Science has the capacity and potential to address these problems.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_326">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_733">I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science on the issue raised by Senator McHugh. A general allocation scheme has been introduced, under which mainstream primary schools have been provided with resource teaching hours based on enrolment figures to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs such as dyslexia and for those with learning support needs. All schools were notified of their general allocation for the school year 2005-06 in May 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia are found in almost every school. It makes sense, therefore, that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school. This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before the Department of Education and Science allocated resource teaching hours. This time-consuming process often led to delays in children obtaining the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">In introducing the general allocation system, transitional arrangements were also introduced to ensure no child in respect of whom resource teaching support was allocated to a school would experience a loss of that support. As outlined in a circular to schools in August 2005 on the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools, it is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education needs, such as dyslexia, who will receive this support. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often, it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into mainstream classes. Here they may receive additional tutorial support through the learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">Significant progress has been made over the past number of years in respect of increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers now works specifically with children with special needs. At second level, approximately 1,630 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support these pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers in our second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment, such as computers, to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, directly for this support.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Initiatives have also been taken in recent years to improve the training and support provided to teachers in respect of dyslexia. An on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia has been introduced. In addition, ten new learning support trainers have been recruited to the primary curriculum support programme, specifically to provide in depth support for the development and implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia. Also, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, an information resource on dyslexia has been produced which is available to schools in CD-ROM, DVD and video format.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">The steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of services for children and young people with dyslexia. I assure Senator McHugh that the Minister for Education and Science will continue to prioritise support for children with special needs, including dyslexia, so that all children are enabled to reach their full potential.</p>

            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_742">The Minister of State must assure parents. The holistic way in which special needs education is being addressed sounds good in general but it does not deal with the specific deficits experienced by parents who may have found their children in primary or secondary schools that do not have the teachers in place with the skills to deal with dyslexia. It is a bigger issue that must also be addressed on a mid to long-term basis at university and primary school teacher college levels.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_329">
            <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_744">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The Minister of State knows of my interest in obtaining an ambulance base in Tuam, north-east Galway. I raised this issue on a number of occasions, pointing out that a design for a major health campus was completed in October 2002. This would include a community hospital, an Alzheimer's disease unit, a child care training centre, a primary care unit and an ambulance base in Tuam. A minimum of two ambulances and eight staff would cost between €600,000 and €800,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">Ambulance bases exist in Galway city, Clifden, Carraroe, west Galway, Loughrea, south-east Galway, and Ballinasloe, serving the Roscommon area. A major gap exists in north-east Galway, where there is no ambulance service. The case is exacerbated by the fact that the service in Galway city, which normally serves north-east Galway, is now too busy to attend to the area. It was envisaged that the site of the former Bons Secours Hospital, Tuam would be the site for the health campus, serving north-east Galway and south Mayo, areas that were part of the former western health board region.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">I was heartened by new proposals for ambulances services in Birr, Roscrea and Shannon but I wish to make my case as strongly as possible to the Department of Health and Children. I have already presented the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children with a petition containing 5,000 names. She is aware of how serious this matter is and met with members of the ambulance trade union who explained the pressure they were under to serve Galway city. The same service is expected to serve north-east Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Seán Power, and the Tánaiste for the recent provision of staff for two cancer care beds to Tuam. This allocation of €250,000 was badly needed and I seek a sum in the region of €800,000 to set up an ambulance base with two ambulances and eight staff. The people of the area need the service quickly as it cannot be provided from Galway city, Mayo or Roscommon.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_330" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_748">I am taking part in this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of ambulance services. I am aware of the many eloquent pleas Senator Kitt has made for a Tuam ambulance service.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Within the western area the HSE provides emergency and patient transport ambulance services to a population of over 350,000 people. The Department of Health and Children is advised that the emergency ambulance service is provided from ten stations across the catchment area. There has been a significant expansion of this service in recent years, the number of 24-hour bases has increased from three to five, while the hours of operation across all bases have increased significantly.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">In 2004 six new high-specification ambulances were provided. In addition, two new rapid response vehicles have been introduced as backup to the new fleet. Facilities at ambulance stations in Ballina, Boyle, Clifden and Roscommon have also been improved. The executive has responsibility for the continuing development of the service. It is developing proposals for the establishment of a number of additional stations in the western area, including a station in the Tuam area.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">The HSE's national ambulance office supports the development of a new ambulance base in Tuam. The provision of additional funding for this development is a matter for the HSE in the context of its capital priorities for 2006.</p>

            <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
            <p eId="para_756">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Hundreds of thousands of people across the country are concerned by the Government's decision to introduce risk equalisation in the health insurance industry. I have addressed this topic in both Houses over the past five or six years. The prospect exists of risk equalisation being adjudicated on in various domestic courts and also the possible, or in my view inevitable, impact on competition being examined from an EU perspective. These prospects are beyond our remit in this House so I wish to focus on the political decision the Government has taken to introduce risk equalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">I was amazed at the Tánaiste's decision to introduce risk equalisation. It goes against every recorded political comment on competition and choice for the consumer. Risk equalisation is a bizarre concept that will shut down competition in the Irish health insurance industry and return us to the days of one company being available to the Irish consumer. Her decision is inexplicable.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">Current circumstances are no different from those of last year, when the Minister for Health and Children refused to introduce risk equalisation. The Health Insurance Authority makes recommendations to Government but on previous occasions when the introduction of risk equalisation was recommended the Minister refused to do so. She did not feel the circumstances warranted the introduction then but the circumstances have not changed. The Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority, charged with the responsibility of examining competition in Irish health insurance, expressed the view that the current situation allows for competition. The Health Insurance Authority has stated that there is no short-term prospect of instability in the health insurance market. In this context I cannot understand why risk equalisation has been introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">In the Irish health insurance market, where the dominant player has a major share of the market, this new policy is bizarre. It is analogous to asking a small local shopkeeper to hand over half his profits to Tesco or another major supermarket chain. Introducing risk equalisation will reduce competition in the health insurance market and we will lose the second largest player in health insurance, BUPA Ireland, and its enterprise in Fermoy, which employs hundreds of people. This will be detrimental to choice and runs counter to the Government policy of being pro-consumer and pro-choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">From where did the impetus come to make the decision to change to risk equalisation? The circumstances which exist in the current calendar year are no different to the circumstances which existed last year, and 12 months ago the Tánaiste refused the recommendation to introduce risk equalisation. She seems to have reversed that policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">Transfer of funding from BUPA through risk equalisation would result in a large proportion of its surplus being put into the VHI reserve. What will that do to ensure the VHI becomes more competitive and efficient? If we want to promote the cause of the VHI, a long-established and valid health insurance company in this country with hundreds of thousands of customers, we should promote efficiency within it. If the VHI has inefficiencies or faces financial issues that are difficult to resolve, simply taking the profits of the smaller company to prop it up will not be of any great benefit to the Irish health insurance consumer in the long run.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">As the Minister of State is aware, the Irish health insurance market is unique by European and world standards. One company is dominant. If we want to change that situation and ensure that people have a choice not simply between VHI and BUPA but between five or six different companies, we must ensure that competition is welcomed and nourished in the Irish market. The introduction at this stage of a risk equalisation policy and transferring the profits of the small company to the large company goes against all that is good for health insurance in the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">The Minister for Health and Children must reflect carefully. If the Minister were of a different Government or from a different political party perhaps there would be some explanation. However, I cannot understand how the Tánaiste made the decision. Whether we are for or against most of her policies, we must concede she has attempted throughout her political career and in all of her utterances, to be a champion of competition, choice, the free market and opening up the market. Risk equalisation goes against all of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Who put on the pressure? Was it the Taoiseach, or was it at union or partnership level? Whoever put on the pressure and made the Tánaiste concede to the introduction of risk equalisation is not doing the Irish health insurance market or consumer any favour in the long term. This type of formula has no place in a modern economy attempting to foster competition. Even at this late stage, and leaving aside the prospect of an adjudication by the courts and Europe on the question of competition, we should be able to show political leadership by reversing the risk equalisation decision.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_336" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_765">I will take the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. There is widespread support in this country, reflected in the decisions of the Oireachtas, for applying community rating to health insurance. Under community rating, subscribers pay the same amount for similar cover throughout their lives. Numerous references were made to the concept of risk equalisation. In truth, risk equalisation is simply the technical formula for the implementation of the principle of community rating.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">Community rating means that individuals can continue to afford health insurance right into those decades of their lives when they are most likely to need it. The position in Ireland, with community rating and lifetime cover in place, is in marked contrast to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States where risk-rated health insurance products result in older subscribers no longer being able to afford to maintain their insurance cover. That is the fundamental policy here and it is certainly subscribed to by my party. I cannot speak for the party of the Tánaiste. However, as Senator Bradford referred to that issue, it shows how compelling a case can be made for risk equalisation and community rating that the Tánaiste decided as she did.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">Risk equalisation is the mechanism that supports a community-rated health insurance market. Provision for risk equalisation has been part of the framework for health insurance since the enactment of the Health Insurance Act 1994. The risk equalisation scheme of 2003, having been affirmed by Seanad Éireann, took effect from 1 July 2003. The scheme had previously been submitted to the EU Commission which, in May 2003, found that the scheme is justified, given the open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover requirements that apply in our health insurance market.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">This is not about taking from a small company and transferring to a large company. It is about maintaining the principles of open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover in our health insurance market. Risk equalisation involves transferring funds from insurance companies which have a large proportion of young, healthy subscribers to companies which have a larger proportion of older persons who are more prone to illness and therefore more likely to make claims on their health insurance policies. This ensures that younger and older subscribers pay the same amount for similar health insurance cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">The Health Insurance Authority submitted its report, in accordance with the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts and the risk equalisation scheme, in respect of the period January to June 2005 on 27 October. The authority, the relevant statutory body, recommended the commencement of risk equalisation transfers having analysed returns made by insurers and having considered representations made. The authority's report confirmed a significant divergence in market risk profiles between insurers. Having considered the authority's report, letters containing a proposed determination were sent to the insurers involved on 21 November last.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">On 23 December, the Tánaiste made the decision that risk equalisation transfers between insurers in the market is necessary, having carefully considered the report submitted by the Health Insurance Authority and representations made by insurers in the market. The Tánaiste did so in accordance with the provisions set out in the risk equalisation scheme and in the Health Insurance Acts, having regard to the best overall interests of health insurance consumers. Commencement of risk equalisation transfers on foot of a recommendation from the authority is subject to specific statutory processes and considerations. The Tánaiste is satisfied that the decision made was the correct one and the question of reviewing it does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">Senator Bradford refers to the need to defend and promote competition. The Health Insurance Acts specifically provide for taking competition into account. They state that the best overall interests of health insurance consumers include a reference to the need to maintain the application of community rating across the market for health insurance and to facilitate competition between undertakings. Given this obligation, the Tánaiste notes that the York economic report commissioned by the Health Insurance Authority concluded that, "there is no satisfactory case for the non-implementation of risk equalisation payments as long as there is a fundamental commitment to community rating".</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme in its report to the then Minister stated: "If the primary policy had been to facilitate and encourage competition and the secondary objective had been the protection of community rating, the Advisory Group would have recommended a scheme of risk equalisation based only on age and gender." The risk equalisation scheme as currently constituted allows the insurance authority to base its calculations on age and gender only, and has been commenced on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">The Tánaiste and the Government are committed to a vigorous community-rated private health insurance market. It is clear that risk equalisation is not in itself inconsistent with a competitive market and it should shift the focus of insurers away from commercial advantage arising from risk selection which is of no benefit to consumers. The Tánaiste is committed to the development of greater competition in the market and has asked the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority to report to her on related measures within six months.</p>

            <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
            <p eId="para_774">Does the Minister of State take seriously the statement by the health insurance company, BUPA, that if risk equalisation is implemented as scheduled and proposed, it will have no choice but to withdraw from the Irish health insurance market? Does he consider that to be a genuine statement based on fact or simply based on posturing?</p>
