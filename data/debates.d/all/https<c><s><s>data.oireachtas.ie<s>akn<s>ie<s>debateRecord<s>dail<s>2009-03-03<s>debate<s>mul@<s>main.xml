            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">Of the 179 civil servants currently serving in my Department, 28 have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme.  The breakdown by grade is two principal officers; seven assistant principals; five higher executive officers; four administrative officers; five executive officers; one staff officer; and four clerical officers.  Some 25 former members of staff have already been assigned to decentralised posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">There are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis.  It is a matter for those Departments to which staff from my Department have decentralised to assign such staff to locations outside of Dublin.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_7">Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, I assume some of the 28 have applied for locations that are now stalled under the decentralisation programme.  What is happening to the sites that were acquired and are now in limbo until the next review in 2011?  In respect of those, has any computation of the loss in value of the sites as a result of depreciation taken place?  I am sure some of the 28 staff of 179 in the Department who have applied will go to locations where nothing is happening, will happen or can happen until whatever review is carried out in 2011.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_8">Any such sites will continue to be managed by the OPW as part of its portfolio.  It is important to point out that to date a total of €276 million has been spent on the programme but there have been offsettings, savings or reallocation of property to other schemes valued in the region of €556 million.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_9">I thank the Taoiseach.  Given the deterioration in the public finances — as the Taoiseach said at the weekend, we do not have a thriving economy just now — the situation is such that we should be up-front about this.  In cases where numbers, grades and categories stack up, this process should have been completed long ago.  However, in the case of some semi-State agencies, it will never happen and putting it off into a sort of limbo for review in 2011 is not facing reality or being truthful with those communities and people throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I support decentralisation.  A well planned, properly managed decentralisation programme has always been of enormous benefit throughout the country, no more so than in the Taoiseach's constituency.  Is it the case that the 2011 review is only a political smokescreen which suggests that in reality this will never happen in the way it was envisaged for the 53 locations when it was announced originally by the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy?</p>
            <p eId="para_11">Are we holding out false hopes for people, including some of the 28 staff from the Taoiseach's Department, that at some future time a decentralisation programme might be put in place when the Taoiseach knows that a review in 2011 means another five or 10 years beyond that before anything is to happen?  Would it not be better to be up-front with these people?  The transfers that are under way should be finished by now.  However, with regard to those situations where there are clearly difficulties or where the numbers, grades and categories do not stack up, perhaps the Taoiseach should tell those communities it will not happen in the way that was envisaged and that we will try to do something else for them in the context of the national development plan.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The right thing to do in the new economic circumstances in which the Government found itself in preparation for the 2009 Estimates was to confirm that there will be a deferral in terms of the provision of accommodation pending review in 2011 in respect of those sites where it was felt, first, there was not a contract in place and, second, it would not have been possible to proceed between now and then.  That was the right decision to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">As I said, more than €350 million of the €556 million was provided by the offsetting of the sale of very high value sites at the height of the property market and the potential for future receipts will be much more limited.  There was also property valued at €75 million which was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership and the OPW has agreed joint venture development schemes with a value of approximately €125 million, subject to the volatility in the current property market.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">It is important to point out with regard to the purchase of sites at the prices available in 2006, 2007 and 2008 that, similarly, those high prices were available in respect of the disposal of many sites.  The figure of €556 million in respect of those disposals provides a positive offsetting against the €276 million that has been spent on the programme to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">The Taoiseach makes all of that sound as if the State is making a profit on decentralisation.  If it is such a financial success, why is he cancelling it?  In the statement the Government made on 14 October that it would not go ahead with the remainder of decentralisation, it was stated it was doing it for budgetary reasons.  However, when he is asked questions about property costs, acquisition costs, fitting-out costs and so on, he is able to quote all of these figures to us to the effect that the Government is getting more in than is going out.  Has there been a net cost to decentralisation and if so, will the Taoiseach tell us that cost?  If there has not been a net cost, what is the budgetary consideration on which he based the decision to cancel the remaining phases and to review these in 2011?</p>
            <p eId="para_16">The last time this round of questions took place, we discussed the numbers decentralised from Dublin.  When the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, announced the decentralisation programme the plan was that 10,000 civil servants would be decentralised from Dublin to other locations.  We now know that 2,500 have been decentralised to other locations, but that less than half of these are from Dublin.  Of the remaining 3,500, only half of these will be from Dublin also.  Can the Taoiseach tell us the total number decentralised from Dublin, as opposed to the 10,000 anticipated under the McCreevy plan?</p>

            <p eId="para_24">When people decentralise and go on to retire, the post remains and is filled where the vacancy arises.  It is the posts that one is transferring.  It is important to point that out.  It is not the case that when people's time is up they will not all relocate back to Dublin.  That is not the idea, the idea is to transfer posts.  That is a very important point, which I thought would have been understood at this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">Anyone working in the Civil Service had the right to apply for decentralisation to his or her preferred position.  As a former trade unionist, I am sure the Deputy would agree there should be no discrimination in respect of people's ability to relocate based on their original location.  I do not believe that is a principle to which the Deputy would subscribe.  All civil servants had the right to relocate to whereever they wished, subject to that being a suitable location, to having the skill sets necessary, or to having the ability to take up the retraining for moving from Department to Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">I do not have the figure.  The Deputy should speak to the Minister for Finance about whether there are any more specific figures available.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">The decision of the Government in October 2008 will facilitate the location of up to 6,000 posts in 40 locations outside of Dublin.  This is made up of 2,600 posts already moved with an additional 3,400 in train at present.  I cannot give the geographical addresses of those people in terms of where they are from.  That is not available to me.  The Deputy should check with the sponsoring Department if that information is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">The success or failure of the programme is not dependent on what percentage of people are Dublin people.  They are all public servants who had a right to relocate if they so wished.  Some were from Dublin and others were not.  Some may have been living in Dublin for some time but still regard themselves as Galway people, such as Deputy Gilmore.  The same applies to County Offaly also.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">The point is well made at this stage and I do not have to labour it any further, if the Deputy will excuse the pun.  The question of costs relates to property costs, which I have given.  The needs of the programme are assessed in the context of the Estimates process each year.  Funding is approved on the basis of the particular projects being progressed in the relevant period.  Originally in 2004, a notional gross figure of €900 million was put on the decentralisation process.  As a gross figure it did not include any possible offsets in terms of what other funds would become available to the State as a result of the decentralisation process.  The figures I have given are the property costs and the offsets as opposed to the costs on the property side show a positive figure in the region of €280 million.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_31">I would like to return to the net cost.  The Taoiseach indicated the estimated cost of the decentralisation process when it was announced was originally put at €900 million plus.  The Government made a decision that it was going to put the decentralisation process on hold — in effect end it — and review it again in 2011.  The statement issued by the Government at the time said that this was being done for budgetary considerations.  The problem I have with this — I ask the Taoiseach to help us out with it — is that when both Deputy Kenny and I ask him questions about the costs, specific questions about the costs of the acquisition of property, fitting out, rental costs and so on, he replies in terms which suggest that the State has been doing very well financially out of the decentralisation process, that because all this property is being acquired in the areas to which civil servants are to be decentralised and properties elsewhere are being released, this has created a net gain for the State.  Is there or is there not a net cost or has there been a net cost to the decentralisation process to date?  Can the Taoiseach tell the House what that net cost is because this does not add up?  If money is being made on decentralisation, why would the Government cancel it for budgetary reasons?  What is the net cost?</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Sorry, it is not a notion.  A total of 6,000 people will be relocated by 2011.  A total of 3,400 are already in the process of being decentralised.  They will be going voluntarily and in line with trade union agreements and in line with the strategic plans of Departments.  I often hear people complaining about decentralisation but I have yet to hear anyone in the House saying the level of service in a decentralised office is less than what it was before.People in these areas will tell one that the relocations have been beneficial in a whole range of ways and not just to the benefit of employees and I am glad to hear this.  It provides an improved working environment for public servants and also improves productivity, because decentralisation brings with it up to date fit-out and computerisation and information systems which makes for a better position than the incremental acquisition of IT, as was the case in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">Has the Taoiseach's Department or any other Department carried out a cost-benefit analysis of any of the decentralisation moves that have already taken place?  Has there been any evaluation of the net benefit, of the monetary impact and how it impinges on the performance and the smooth running of the said relocated Departments or sections of Departments?  Will the Taoiseach give the House an indication if such an exercise has been carried out?</p>
            <p eId="para_44">With regard to the various land banks and properties that have been purchased in preparation for planned relocations, I understand there are currently at least five sites that have not yet been developed in preparation for the relocation of the targeted Departments.  Among those are two sites in County Waterford that cost in excess of €10.1 million of the €16.3 million involved in the five sites to which I refer — at Waterford and Dungarvan.  There was another site in the Taoiseach's constituency in Offaly, one in Kilkenny and one in my constituency, in Cavan, where the Department for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the HIQA offices were to be located.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether all of these are greenfield sites, or if there are properties involved that would entail ongoing maintenance and security?  Is there a continual outlay in terms of the maintenance, upkeep etc. of any or all of these sites, and can he indicate whether the Government intends to proceed with the roll-out of each of the signalled relocations to the five sites in question?</p>

            <p eId="para_45">The Government decided in October 2008 to defer any further decision on those matters until 2011.  As the Deputy says, the context in which sites are being held under the management of the OPW relates to that decision and therefore there will be no change in their status until 2011 at the earliest.  At that stage the Government will revisit the issue, having completed the present stage by which time some 6,000 will have been relocated to about 40 sites throughout the country.  I cannot anticipate what the Government's decision will be at that time.</p>

Is there not within the Taoiseach's gift the wherewithal to be frank with the House rather than this kicking to touch in terms of 2011?

My question is on the general responsibility of the Taoiseach as Head of Government regarding the decentralisation programme.  The original announcement by the Taoiseach was that in a number of cases full Departments were being decentralised.  In general Government policy terms, is it still the case that where the full Department, the Aireacht, is moving, all senior officials, including the Ministers, will move?  I ask that question because next month the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister sitting along side the Taoiseach will be coming to my constituency; I am looking forward to a cycle lane all the way to Wexford to welcome him.  Since a very fine ministerial suite will be available for him and the Ministers of State, is it Government policy that Ministers will operate from the decentralised head offices or will there be parallel Aireachtaí in Dublin as well as in decentralised offices in cases where a full Department is decentralised?</p>

            <p eId="para_72">From recollection in my previous capacity, the Decentralisation Implementation Group has brought a number of reports to the attention of Government in respect of implementation of the programme and from memory one of them relates to the question of ensuring there is sufficient capacity available to Ministers in respect of their responsibilities here in the Dáil and in respect of their location in Dublin as well as the transfer of Departments to the decentralised location in question, which in this case is in Wexford.  The Minister's attendance at that location, therefore, would be facilitated by him having an office and, similarly, he would have an office in Dublin in respect of the job he would have to do here.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I am working from memory, but I think the Decentralisation Implementation Group had a view on that which would allow the Minister retain certain core personnel in Dublin as well.  That Aireacht idea has arisen subsequently in the context of discussion and negotiation with trade unions and employee representative groups.  I believe the implementation group has come up with a solution that enables neither issue to be mutually exclusive, in other words, we can have people in Dublin on a permanent basis.  That would have the net effect of not everyone transferring from Dublin to the Department area.  That is my most up to date——</p>

            <p eId="para_79">It is not a question of duplication.  It is a question of having a facility available to a Minister were he or she to be located there and working from there and having an office in Dublin.  It is not a question of having just one office per Ministry and having to decide where that might be.  From an efficacy point of view, a Minister must have the ability to operate from whatever location one is in at any given time.  There are Ministers of State who have more than one Department under their aegis who, when they go from one Department to another, are able to work in that Department.  These are logistical matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">To answer Deputy Ó Caoláin, and in an effort to be as frank and candid as I possibly can without him reinterpreting Government decisions, the question of the timing of further work on implementation of the balance of the programme, other than those priority locations announced on budget day, is being deferred pending a review in 2011 in the light of budgetary developments.  The Government's preference would have been not to delay any aspect of the programme, but in light of the deterioration in the public finances it has been necessary to curtail capital expenditure across a range of projects.  All the projects simply cannot be afforded in the short term due to the current economic situation and this is a sensible and reasoned approach to adopt, given the circumstances.</p>

There are 40 locations with decentralised staff under the programme.  There are 12 locations where sufficient progress has not been made for that to happen.  As the Deputy knows, there have been particular industrial relations issues in State agencies where there has not been a tradition of cross-departmental relocation, as would be the case with the Civil Service and the issue remains a matter for industrial relations.  The only deception I can detect is in the Deputy's question in that he is criticising the decentralisation programme in the House when he has also been in Westmeath extolling it and claiming he is its author in the local newspapers.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">The corporate procurement plan in place in my Department was developed to implement the requirements of the national procurement policy framework published by the Department of Finance.  It reflects my Department's commitment to effective and efficient resource allocation and service provision as prescribed by the Public Service Management Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">Procurement of goods and services by my Department is carried out under procedures recommended by the national public procurement policy unit in the Department of Finance which is responsible for procurement policy, national procurement guidelines and the application of EU directives.  These procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate competitive processes are in place to select the providers of goods and services which represent best value to the Department, taking account of a number of important criteria including cost and suitability for purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">The procedures in place in my Department, which vary according to the nature and amount of the procurement involved, require purchasers to specify accurately their requirements; to select an appropriate competitive process; whether by seeking quotations, advertising, use of central purchasing facilities and centrally negotiated framework agreements or more formal tender processes; to evaluate alternatives according to preset criteria; to agree clear contract terms; and to monitor service delivery.  The procurement plan is due to be reviewed and updated this year.  The new plan to cover a three-year period will incorporate any new measures identified by the Department of Finance to contribute to improving the procurement process.</p>

At that time it was announced that a task force would be set up, a national operations unit, within the Office of Public Works.   Four months on, what is the status of that unit?  Can the Taoiseach provide an example of what the projected savings will be, as a consequence, for public procurement?  They must be significant.  There has been talk about them for 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">Four months on, is there an example of a contract for products, goods or services which has actually been agreed under the public procurement operation?  What are the consequent savings to the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_96">I do not have that sort of detailed information.  I can answer in a general manner.  The unit has been set up within the Office of Public Works and works to leverage the public service's buying power and organises procurement across the public service of common goods and services such as office equipment, furniture, vehicles, electricity and fuel.  Where better value for money can be obtained it will develop further the e-tender system.  The unit will also support a more professional approach to public sector procurement through the provision of advice and the organisation of networks of procurement professionals.  It was established this year and it has a target of achievable savings of €25 million for this year with increased savings in subsequent years.</p>

Are there major restrictions on what Departments can do in giving such guidance as a result of EU competition law?  Is there within the Union any re-evaluation, reconsideration or relaxation proposed of the restrictions that may apply to governments and local authorities that wish to see public moneys expended locally and nationally first?

            <p eId="para_108">Procurement policy and practice must conform to certain core principles and must be accountable, competitive and non-discriminatory, provide for equality of treatment and be fair, transparent and conducted with probity and integrity.  As the Deputies have stated, those kinds of consideration have come into play in respect of what were formally known as "Buy Irish" campaigns, which did not have those constraints imposed upon them.  We are now members of the Single Market and people have access to apply for tenders over a certain threshold.  The same applies to Irish companies in respect of other EU states in which we compete.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">I would take the point that tenders are prepared in a way that would not exclude smaller or medium-sized enterprises, which should have an opportunity.  Those who prepare tenders need to be mindful of the need to ensure that people are not excluded by reason of the way in which tender documents are constructed and to be conscious of the need to divide tenders so that SMEs would not be automatically excluded.  These kinds of consideration have to be borne in mind in an effort to make sure that local suppliers are given the opportunity in their own country to tender for these contracts.</p>

Does the Taoiseach agree that careful preparation and management of the tender examination process are required to remain in compliance with current EU directives?</p>
            <p eId="para_111">In terms of local government, will the Taoiseach indicate to his ministerial colleague, the leader of the Green Party, that this situation is applicable, not only to Departments, but across the local authority spectrum?  I come from a constituency wherein furniture and cabinet making has been integral to generations of workers, but that sector has been devastated by cheap imports and kits, which have become the order of the day.  This fact was in the Deputy's mind when he asked his questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">From the Taoiseach's recent EU engagement, where matters not unconnected with what is at the core of this series of questions were raised, is there a potential for some relaxation of requirement orders within a specified value?  Have other ideas been explored?  We have a restriction across the board on open access to tendering, but is there no opportunity to ameliorate the situation by considering the order profile in terms of value scale.  This might offer some important assistance to Irish manufacturers and service providers in these difficult times.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_116">No, it related to where professional fees are charged on the basis of contractual arrangements between professionals providing the State with services.  The tendering process deals with the question of value for money more generally.  As for Deputy Ó Caoláin's points, the issue pertains to the introduction of reforms such as e-auctioning, whereby people could offer a price on a certain number, consistent with their own capacity, in respect of a much larger tender.  In other words, such flexibility must be considered in order that the tender need not be filled by a single supplier, if people have a knowledge of the quality of the product that is being suggested by various smaller suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">Sometimes one must balance the effort to accommodate everyone regarding the submission of tenders with the overall need for value for money.  E-tendering or e-auctioning has a benefit in that, for example, one can lump together a tender and achieve best value for money by having a number of local authorities apply for the same type of product or service at the same time.  Simultaneously, it enables people to apply without being obliged to fill the tender themselves solely, if the Deputy understands my point.  There are ways and means by which the issues pertaining to value for money and the flexibility to ensure the process is inclusive can be worked on, were people to apply their minds creatively to it.</p>

The PAYE tax booklet, which involved a relatively small contract, was awarded to a printer outside the State.  However, had the Irish and English versions been grouped together, it is possible that it would not have attracted tenders from outside the State.  While I do not suggest this necessarily would have been the case, the Irish version of that booklet was printed here and the English version——</p>

            <p eId="para_132">The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics task force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The taskforce included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The recently published task force report makes a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  It highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">In this regard, I understand that Enterprise Ireland has been proactive in ensuring that Irish businesses are aware of the opportunities for benefiting from the business opportunities which London 2012 will provide.  A dedicated website has been established to assist Irish business to avail of these opportunities.  The tourism agencies have committed themselves to an energetic approach to the marketing of Ireland, particularly in the lead up to and during the games, while the artistic and cultural agencies stand ready to organise events which will showcase Ireland to the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">On the sporting side, the task force report puts forward proposals for investment in sports facilities that would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead-up and during the games.  However, we must be realistic in this area, particularly given the current economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">My Department will engage shortly with the relevant sporting, tourism and cultural agencies on how best to promote Ireland internationally in the lead up to the London 2012 games.  These discussions will take account of the current economic situation, the findings of the London 2012 task force report and my recent meetings to identify the challenges which must be met in the preparation of our team for the London games.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_137">I thank the Minister for his reply.  The task force report suggests the potential financial benefit to the State arising from the staging of the 2012 Olympic Games in London may be in the order of €140 million.  I am confident it could be far greater provided that we are able to capitalise on all the opportunities that present.  It is a one-off event for this generation to have people travelling from every country in the world to a location virtually on our doorstep.  The last time the Olympics Games took place so close to us was shortly after the Second World War.  We are being presented with a unique opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">Are efforts being made to secure business for the State not only in terms of athletes' preparation for the Games, as originally envisaged, but also in terms of a tourism spin-off?  Of the many visitors coming to London, some may be induced to continue on to Ireland.  Is there any linking up among hotels?  I understand the Minister is engaged in discussions with industry representatives with a view to focusing efforts to promote Ireland as a cultural tourism destination.  There is great potential for our tourism industry in the Olympic Games.  Are efforts being made to promote Ireland as a cultural tourism destination in the countries from which people are most likely to travel to London in 2012?</p>
            <p eId="para_139">The funding which the Minister indicated some time ago might be provided to invest in various facilities is not now available.  In any case, the games are getting too close for such initiatives.  There was a possibility of something happening at Sports Campus Ireland.  The Minister specifically mentioned investigating the possibility of a velodrome.  What is the status of that proposal?  Has any further investigation taken place and is the project likely to proceed?  If so, is it likely to be ready in time for the Olympic Games?  We would have to begin marketing such a facility immediately.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_100" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_140">On the first point, the Deputy is quite accurate in the breadth of what she said.  As I said, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are very much involved in seeking out the business opportunities that present between now and 2012.  A significant number of Irish companies are contracted to undertake some of the construction work.  This is positive in itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">As the Deputy is aware, I had a useful meeting with the chairman of the 2012 Olympic Games organisation in the United Kingdom, Sebastian Coe, at which he suggested a cultural Olympics which would run parallel with the sporting side.  I have had discussions with the Arts Council in this regard and bilateral discussions have already taken place.  What is envisaged is events being run in Dublin as part of a package with events taking place in the United Kingdom.  The objective would be to encourage people to take two or three days out of their stay in the United Kingdom to visit Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford or elsewhere in the State.  Offering packages of events running parallel to the games would be an effective way of encouraging such tourism.  Work is ongoing in this regard and I am confident we will be able to attract significant numbers of visitors.  The evidence suggests that significant numbers of people will go to the Olympic Games for three weeks with their families but will not want to spend every day there.  There is a significant cultural opportunity for us.  As part of their planning for 2012, the various agencies are in contact with the authorities in the United Kingdom.  The latter have been very positive, welcoming and open with us in exploring how Ireland may best reap the rewards of the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">On the second point, I indicated on a previous occasion that I hoped to provide a range of facilities at Abbottstown.  Unfortunately, that is no longer possible, although some smaller-scale facilities may be put in place in time.  I do not have the resources to fund a velodrome.  It is as simple as that.  If there were a possibility of private sector support, that would be explored.  However, this is unlikely in the current economic situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">We should not underestimate what is happening in Limerick.  I am astonished at the quality of the international athletes coming into Limerick.  It is amazing to see the best athletes in their various fields having connectivity with Limerick both in terms of the physiotherapy and medical side, but also the training side.  That centre is going from strength to strength and carving out a tremendous international reputation for Ireland.  Likewise, Australian athletes have told us that the aquatic centre is one of the finest Olympic centres they have seen anywhere in the world.  Athletes from several countries are considering using it because it has full Olympic diving facilities and warm-up facilities and a full Olympic swimming pool.  These facilities are in place and we will be able to capitalise on them.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_145">Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  The programme, which is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities, has transformed the sporting landscape of the State, with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">More than 7,400 projects providing a range of essential sports facilities have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocation in that time to more than €725 million.  In 2008, more than €50 million was allocated towards 685 separate sports facility and equipment projects.  These grants continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the provision of modern, high-quality facilities throughout the State that attract more people to participate in sporting activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">My Department is currently finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the State.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy will also identify the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It will aim to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact on participation in the relevant areas, including those in lower socioeconomic groups.  The national sports facilities strategy will address future sports facility funding and provision and will inform decisions on future rounds of the sports capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">In the 2009 Estimates, €56 million was provided in my Department's Vote, part-funded from the proceeds of the national lottery, to cover payments to be made this year from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  Any decision on future rounds of the programme will be considered in the context of the prevailing budgetary situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">Like Deputy Mitchell, I am glad the Minister was not obliged to engage in any high-risk sports such as hang-gliding or parachuting yesterday.  We are glad no serous injuries occurred as a consequence of the incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">As I understand it, no new sports capital funding is provided for 2009.  Is there any reason that national lottery funding cannot be allocated in order to facilitate new applications?  It is my understanding that projects already in receipt of funding in 2008 will continue in 2009 but that no new sports capital funding is coming on board.  Will the Minister explain why national lottery funding cannot be dedicated for this purpose?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_103" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_151">For the 685 projects approved last year, funding is continued into this year.  There is a further overhang of projects in recent years that will also be completed.  In total, some 1,000 projects are set for completion.  Lottery funding is not, nor ever was, abrogated to my Department.  Rather, it goes into the central Exchequer, along with all revenues to the State.  That always has been the case.  It is reasonable to conclude that the sports capital programme may have been partly funded by lottery money, which is allocated through the central Exchequer, over the years.  However, there is no abrogated lottery funding that is ring-fenced to my Department for sports investment.  I wish there were, but that has never been the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">I will not deny that the prevailing budgetary situation poses a great problem for us all, not least in my own area of responsibility.  Given the scale of the investment involved, I am seeking to establish, on a regional basis, where facilities are lacking.  For example, some regions are strong in some areas and weak in others.  The objective is to have a good balance across the regions.  The way forward is to have a five-year strategic framework instead of funding almost anything that comes in provided it meets certain criteria.  Now is the time for a slight pause.  The current economic situation has implications for us, but I may as well take advantage of it by coming up with something positive.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_154">No, because the commitments already given require every cent of the funding for 625 projects allocated and contracted.  More projects have not yet started for various reasons.  I cannot say how many will proceed but the sum of €56 million will be drawn down in the current year for projects to which resources have already been allocated.</p>

        <b>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
         the progress that has been made on the review of the funding of the horseracing industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_156">Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  Under the provisions of the Act, the fund has received a guaranteed level of finance each year from 2001 to 2008.  This was based on excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation.  Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty was made up by direct Exchequer subvention.  In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from €254 million to €550 million to continue the fund for a further four years to 2008.  By the end of 2008 a total of €545.8 million had been paid out of the fund.  The remaining balance in the fund at the start of 2009 was €4.2 million.  Some €69.6 million has been allocated to the fund for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">The rationale of the fund is that the horse and greyhound racing industries need certainty about funding support on a multi-annual basis and that the mechanism for such certainty should be derived from the duty generated from off-course betting.  Prior to 2001 the horse and greyhound racing bodies were funded with annual grant-in-aid allocations as well as 0.3% of turnover and a fixed fee from off-course betting.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">Funding of both of these agencies supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding and training enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  Together these industries these account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy including farm incomes.  This is often forgotten.  The funding given to the greyhound racing sector helps in sustaining a tradition that has existed for hundreds of years and in underpinning the economic activity of what are in many instances less affluent regions of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">This funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing.  Horse Racing Ireland has undertaken a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The fund has also contributed significantly to the almost €90 million that has been invested in the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.  A review of the fund is nearing completion and will be submitted to the Government in due course in the context of deciding on the future funding of these industries.  Any extension of the fund will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas.  I will shortly bring proposals to the House as there is a technical requirement for me to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">The Minister does not have to preach to me about the importance of the industry.  I accept how important it is to showcase Ireland, for its jobs and as a foreign exchange earner.  It is also important to the rural economy.  This year, a figure of €69 million has been allocated in the budget.  The Minister is on record as saying it will come from the increase in taxation.  The levy increased from 1% to 2%.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">The sector is suggesting we should capture some of the revenue spent on Internet betting.  The William Hill chain is closing its shops, although this might not be a great loss, but even Paddy Power is saying that three quarters of its profits come from online betting and telephone betting.  There is much revenue to be captured.  Has any progress been made on devising a way to capture some of the benefit of this expenditure by people?</p>

            <p eId="para_164">The fund has been reduced this year in the Estimates process.  As we went through this I had discussions on the matter.  The fund is €69 million, reduced from over €80 million.  There was acceptance in the industry that it had to take the hit.  The industry, Deputies Mitchell and Barrett and I were <i>ad idem</i> that resourcing must come from within the industry.  The taxation must be self-financing.  I have provided for €69 million but betting tax will not yield that amount.  It remains to be seen how much it will yield.  I had to be certain in respect of the industry’s investment profile to provide certainty in respect of what the year would hold.  The review is under way and Deputy Barrett is involved in part of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">There has been a great expansion in betting but the problem is that the vast majority of this is Internet betting and telephone betting and this money is going offshore.  Even 0.5% of the figure would make an incredible difference to the industry.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_167">A figure of 0.5% is very small and 1% would do wonders.  Experts who know far more than I are trying to get their heads around this.  Only two of the companies operate in Ireland and much offshore betting is done with companies that do not operate in Ireland.  The major problem is how to get at the tax of a company that operates somewhere else.  Some of the companies are offshore altogether.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">In the United States it has been banned.  The authorities could not get at it so they banned it, with hefty fines for anyone caught betting on the Internet or by telephone.  These options are on the table although I do not wish to send out the message that this is the option we will use.  There are enough interests in the broad industry for everyone to come together to share so that this industry, which is wonderful for its members and economically important for the country, can survive.  A small burden could be borne to maximise the taxation from the industry and this would be more than sufficient to put the horseracing and greyhound industries in excellent shape for the next decade and beyond.</p>

            <p eId="para_174">Progress is ongoing on the new national theatre project.  The project is complex and there is a myriad of technical, procedural and legal factors to address.  The successful delivery of the project is a priority for the Department and Government in the programme for Government and the national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">An international design competition was one of the conditions of the offer of the site by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  A project team, chaired by the Office of Public Works and comprising representatives of the same agencies as the steering group, has also been established and has met on 21 occasions.  It is overseeing the executive and procedural arrangements for holding the international design competition and advancing the PPP process.  A jury for the international design competition has also been appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">The Office of Public Works is also working on drafting output specifications in collaboration with the Department, the Abbey Theatre and the National Development Finance Agency.  Technical, legal, insurance and financial advisers have been appointed to guide and advise the interagency teams in the procurement of this epochal and crucial project.  A theatre consultant and acoustic consultant have also been appointed.  Furthermore, a process auditor is in place in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines.  Site investigative works have been also undertaken.  When a winning design has been chosen, the National Development Finance Agency will oversee the PPP procurement process in accordance with PPP guidelines.  I am confident that when the international design competition is complete, we will have a world class design for a new iconic landmark building for the city, and the new quayside theatre will be a dynamic structure reflecting Dublin's reputation as a global capital of theatre, culture and creativity.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">The market is well aware that this project is on the way and the international competition for the design of the theatre should get under way formally in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_178">In view of the shock to the Minister's system yesterday, I want to go easy on him today.  The truth is that this design competition has been in gestation for years.  It is not as if the Minister is designing the building as it is only the guidelines of a competition for somebody to design the building.  It is incredible that it could possibly take this long.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">How much has been spent so far on the various consultants?  The Minister has provided lists of various consultants who have been appointed to prepare for the design competition.  Is the intention to proceed with the new Abbey with all speed or has this been put on the long finger indefinitely?  If it is intended to proceed, will it be in the way originally envisaged, in that it would be designed, financed and maintained by way of PPP?  Is it realistic to expect that somebody will come in and build such a project in this uncertain climate?  That question stands over all PPPs.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">The decision to proceed was taken in autumn 2006.  There have been 21 meetings since and from the time I came to this Department, I have been aware of the complexities in terms of technical specifications, the arguments and substantial differing views of what the project should comprise.  Much of that has been washed out and resolved through the system, and that is why we have moved to a position where we can clearly move forward.  The final work is being done at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The OPW, with which the Deputy is familiar, is superb at PPPs and managing this type of project, working with the other agencies.  It has done great work in this area.  As far as I understand, everybody has signed off on the specifications, and the arguments and discussions on what, where, how, etc., have been resolved.  As I indicated in my initial reply, we are now into a phase where we can move the project to the public domain.</p>

         his views on the result of the promised benchmarking of the National Aquatic Centre’s performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> other similar facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_191">The National Aquatic Centre is operated by NSCDA (Operations) Limited, a subsidiary company of the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  All day-to-day operations of the National Aquatic Centre are a matter for the authority and the operations company.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">In parallel with overseeing the ongoing operation, in 2008 the authority undertook an international benchmarking exercise comparing the performance of the centre against other equivalent facilities around the world.  This work was completed last year and has been evaluated both by the authority and by my officials.  Utilising a model of best international practice, the report provides a forecast for trading over the next five years and through this process, identifies the need for an annual subsidy.  In general terms, the clear message is that all publicly accessible 50 metre indoor pools receive direct or indirect subsidies from governments, local authorities, sports councils, universities and other like organisations. In this regard, therefore the performance of the National Aquatic Centre is not dissimilar to other like facilities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_129">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_193">The Minister knows my views on this facility.  In 2007, the centre received a subsidy of €1.8 million, in 2008 it received a subsidy of €1 million and there is an overhang rates bill of €600,000 that has not been paid and is due.  I discovered since we spoke about this last that as a result of a benchmarking process, the centre is entitled to an annual subsidy of €1 million, so I presume it is built into the budget for the coming year and thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">It is somewhat convenient that after the event we have discovered that a subsidy will be required.  The centre was built on the basis in the PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study that there would be an operating profit of between €500,000 and just over €2 million annually.  Did PricewaterhouseCoopers do the benchmarking or was it some other body?  Will it be sued for the bad advice given or is there any comeback now that we have built this facility?</p>
            <p eId="para_195">I do not know what the centre was benchmarked against but in Abbotstown there is a leisure facility as well as the 50 metre pool in addition to the other facilities.  It is a wonderful centre but I have visited it at peak times and there were approximately 30 people in the water.  It is grossly under-used, which makes me think it is being grossly mismanaged.  The Minister must act on this.  While I do not want to criticise him, there is a serious problem at the National Aquatic Centre.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_198">I cannot tell the Deputy as I did not hire it.  The history of the aquatic centre has been unhappy but I give credit to the chairman, Mr. Dan Flinter, and the group there currently, which has done a remarkable job since it took it over.  The numbers have been brought back from approximately 350,000 and the group has addressed a raft of problems in the way the facility was being run.  There are now over 700,000 using the facilities and that number is growing.  They are the sorts of numbers that the Deputy and I would wish to see.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">There is a significant number of school children, etc., getting training and all means possible are being used to increase numbers.  It is clear that a similar facility on any international scale is in receipt of a subsidy.  There is a similar one in Australia, which has a state subsidy of €2 million per year.  With a subsidy of €1 million, the facility is very much at the lower end of the scale in that regard.  This is because there are leisure facilities and income is being generated.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">The new group has done remarkable job in reducing energy costs and that is reflected in the decreasing subsidy.  It brought the best people in to advise on all aspects of the issue.  I have had numerous meetings with the chairman and there is a level of frustration.  There is anecdotal evidence that appears every now and again from one or two sources that seems to gather a bit of momentum regarding how the place is being run.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">I have examined this facility as it is so important, both nationally and internationally.  We want to maximise the use of it and this has now been done.  Those involved in running it would accept that as they have resolved many of the significant problems regarding personnel, etc.  There is a new platform on which to work and the facility will probably get that subsidy.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">This has the potential to become a black hole.  I am not going on anecdotal evidence as I went out myself to look at the facility.  There were no more than 30 people in the facility, although the leisure facilities are probably relatively well used.  The aquatic centre — the pool, diving area and lessons — is grossly under-used, no matter what the Minister is being told.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_135" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_207">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 57 and 291 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector has made to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Even within the current economic constraints I do not consider investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors as somehow discretionary.   As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I was pleased to secure overall funding of €185 million for the arts, culture and film sectors in this year's budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">The Arts Council is the State agency charged primarily with the promotion and funding of the arts.  I continue to monitor and review the resources at my disposal to facilitate the council in its vital work.  To this purpose, funding for the arts and culture sectors has increased significantly in recent years.  For example, funding to the Arts Council had increased by 72.2% since 2002, from €47.67 million to €81.6 million in 2008.  Due to the serious budgetary constraints now confronting us the level of funding for the Arts Council had to be reduced for 2009 to €74.439 million, but with reductions to arts organisations being minimised as much as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">I am acutely aware of the employment potential which the arts and culture areas represent.  According to 2007 Pocketbook on Cultural Statistics, EUROSTAT estimates that there were 48,000 employed in the cultural sector in Ireland in 2005 representing 2.5% of the total number employed in Ireland.  This figure compares well with other EU member states and is marginally higher than the 2.4% EU average.  Other EU studies estimate that the culture and creative sectors in Ireland contributed 1.7% to GDP in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">The arts, culture and creative sectors are key elements of the cultural tourism agenda.  As Deputy Mitchell recognised earlier, the sectors are real and enduring employers and the fulcrum of a smart economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">I am optimistic regarding the spirit, ability, and willingness of those involved in the arts to adapt and mobilise in not only facing future challenges but in turning them into opportunities.  In that regard the key findings of the recent Creative West report are worth reciting.  The western region has 4,779 businesses in the creative sector employing 11,000 people, accounting for 3% of total regional employment, and generating €534 million in annual turnover.  Creative sector businesses in the region are mainly indigenous, small scale and rooted in their western location with 98% headquartered in the region.  Quality of life and inspiration are among the strongest motivators for creative people to live and work in the western region.  Currently there is relatively little networking among creative businesses in the region and economic opportunities may be lost because of this.  Greater linkages between the creative sector and other sectors can enhance innovation across the economy.  There is potential for overseas market growth as currently only €74 million of total turnover is exported.</p>
            <p eId="para_213">In the current economic conditions the arts and culture sectors will not be immune from the knock-on impact on revenues.   I have asked the Arts Council to keep my Department informed on trends in this area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_136">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_214">We all recognise that money is tight and that there will be cutbacks.  The purpose of these questions is to ensure that cutbacks will be made in a way that causes the least damage in terms of employment.  I accept what the Minister said about the Western Development Commission's report.  It is precisely because those jobs are dispersed throughout the country that is difficult to track what happens when cutbacks are made.  Is there any possibility of tracking, through the CSO, the Arts Council or some mechanism within the industry, be it through theatre companies or the Irish Film Board, the impact of the economic downturn on the industry?</p>
            <p eId="para_215">I am aware that the film industry is suffering in this respect.  The Irish Film Board is commissioning less work, as is RTE, TV3 and TG4.  Reports from within the film industry suggest there has been a loss of almost half of the jobs in the industry.  That would be catastrophic because, as the Minister knows, it is an important sector and a big employer.  It is one that can disappear from the country overnight as it is very mobile.  That is the reason I am anxious to ascertain if there is any way of checking the impact of economic downturn on the industry and if, for example, the Irish Film Board should commission several smaller films rather than one big one, given that our tax system is not very conducive to the funding of big movies.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_137" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_216">The Deputy raised a number of points.  I agree with her that the industry is dispersed throughout the country.  It percolates down into small communities and villages and the people involved in it get good employment.  The industry plays an important role in the heart and spirit of many communities.  Unlike many other businesses, it has the capacity to get into areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">Through the Arts Council, we are trying to monitor the effect of the economic downturn.  We have tried to maximise the allocation of resources to maintain jobs in all the activities that occur in the arts sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">I am surprised at the information the Deputy has received about the film industry.  I have not had any such indication.  There was a significant Irish presence at the Oscar Academy Awards in Los Angeles last week and a significant Irish event was held leading up to the ceremony.  It was an event I was supposed to attend, but in the current circumstances I thought if I was seen near the Oscar Academy Awards it would be misunderstood.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Approximately €150 million worth of business was on the table, which is a substantial increase on the figure for last year.  We made changes to section 481 of the legislation in the budget on the basis of advice received from the Irish Film Board and others in the industry.  The move to provide 100% tax relief for investment and to increase from €31,750 to €50,000 the limit for such investment, has had a significant impact.  Everyone everywhere is feeling the pinch and we have to monitor how many of these projects will materialise.  Last year the Irish Film Board funded approximately 25 feature films.  I gave this figure the other day, and I can be corrected on it if I am wrong, but it was a significant number, which generated approximately €75 million in terms of activity in the country.  Therefore, that was the right approach.  The Irish Film Board funded a large number of small films.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">I would not want the film board to put all its resources into funding one large film.  It has a role and recognises it to be that of investment in generating jobs for young artists and creating opportunities for new directors, producers and actors to get involved in the film industry.  The sector has had a very successful year.  Gabriel Byrne and Colin Farrell won Golden Globes.  The Costa Book of the Year Award was won by an Irish author.  Success was enjoyed across the spectrum in that the Irish short film, "New Boy", which was fully funded by the Irish Film Board, won a Global Globe — it did not win an Oscar.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">People tend to talk about this industry as a nice added extra, but given the current digital era, the creative talent we have, in terms of those who work in these major international digital companies, is fermenting in the film industry.  Some 1,000 people were employed in the industry five or six years ago while more than 6,000 of the best of people are employed in it now.  In terms of the quality of people working in the Irish film sector, it is seen as one of the best in the world.  We were being passed out by other countries, as Deputy Mitchell corrected pointed out, in terms of the incentives they give to get films produced.  We have now corrected that imbalance.  That was reflected in what happened last week in Los Angeles.  I am optimistic that the business this year will be as good and hopefully better than in previous years.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_138">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_222">I agree with everything the Minister said in both parts of his reply, which is basically all about the importance of the arts.  I fully subscribe to that and agree with the Minister.  My concern is that there will be job losses in the industry, which the Minister has acknowledged.  It is almost inevitable.  There is no reason this, no more than any other industry, should be insulated from that.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">I wish to raise two points.  We have a tracking mechanism for many of the industries such as the construction industry, the catering industry and so on.  Could we not find a way to establish exactly what jobs in the industry have been lost or are likely to be lost?  My other point is that two or three jobs will be lost here and there, the immediate effect of which may not be noticeable, but for the individuals concerned it will be just as damaging and as important as if 100 jobs were lost in another area.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">Those with arts related jobs must keep up to speed.  The Minister mentioned the development in the digital area, which is rapidly advancing.  If people in this industry lose their jobs, will the Minister discuss with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment ways to refocus or redirect those people into jobs to enable them to keep their skills up to date and to be effectively employed in a valuable way, for example, in schools or in communities?  There are various ways in which they could be employed.</p>

            <p eId="para_225">I hope we took the right decision and the early indications are that we did.  Rather than people losing their jobs, I expect all the jobs in the film sector will be sustained this year in Ireland because it was indicated in Los Angeles last week that there is €150 million worth of potential projects in the pipeline.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">I am aware of that but I am referring directly to the people involved in the specific high end of the digital sector, the television film sector.  That indication is very positive.  I hope that is the outcome at the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">There is an informal tracking of jobs through the Arts Council and I can examine whether we can put it on a formal tracking basis through the CSO or some other mechanism.  It is probably more difficult to do that because it is diffuse in the sense of its dispersement, not in the sense of its importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">I am very conscious of that and I have tried hard to address it with support from the Deputies.  It is very important when we talk about the arts sector to continually make the point that it is not some added extra in good times.  It is very much at the heart of economic activity of this country and very much at the heart of the broadest creative sector including in technology — in companies like Intel.  Many of the creative people that are developing come out of this area or are formed in this type of situation and I think we need to try and do that.  I accept that there will be some pain to be borne.  There is no point in denying it.  However, I believe we have done as much as we can to protect the primacy and importance of the jobs in the sector.  I recognise that the sector makes an enormous contribution to tourism and the hard economy rather than simply cultural tourism and in addition brings international respect for Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_230">I agree with the Minister.  The importance of the arts goes beyond the importance of the jobs — important as they are.  The only good news stories coming out of Ireland in the past six months have been from the arts, including the Oscar awards and the achievements of our writers, which is of great value to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">While it is great that we now have so many regional arts venues, as the Minister knows I have expressed concern in the past about them always being on the breadline and on the cusp of being unviable.  With the reduction in touring, some of them will be in very dire financial straits.  The safety net of local authority funding will probably disappear, as their income will be greatly reduced.  Is there any way to track the viability of those venues over the next 12 months or so in order to ascertain the impact of the shortage of touring etc. and the reduction in their annual grants, including their maintenance grants, which is a major factor?  Without a reasonable maintenance grant, some of those centres will need to close even from a health and safety point of view, which would undermine the point of having built them in the first place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_232">The present economic circumstances will impact on some of the points the Deputy is making and it would be foolish to think otherwise.  I am conscious of that and I am trying to track through the local authorities, the Arts Council and other bodies what exactly is happening to ascertain the impact.  I am also getting the message back that people can be smarter, more efficient and more productive with less — and they are saying that.  The scale of the increase in the arts funding in recent years was phenomenal — and rightly so.  There has been a 72% increase in arts funding in the past four or five years.  The level of funding has hardly gone back in terms of the past year or two.  It is a question of trying to get more value, squeeze more out of it with people doing less.  There may be some jobs lost here and there.  I suppose that is inevitable to some degree.  People will also make some career choice moves.  At this stage what is recognised is that we are happy that we did not get mauled.  We have taken our share.  We do not want to take any more pain.  We want to get on now with what we are doing and want to plan on that basis.  Perhaps when we return for parliamentary questions in the House in couple of months time I may have more information for the Deputies on that specific point.</p>

            <p eId="para_234">On 11 February I met the heads of 15 State tourism agencies, State arts bodies, and the cultural institutions to begin the work of further developing the cultural tourism market.  This is the first step in implementing my undertaking to put in place an initiative to further develop the potential of cultural tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">This initiative will build, in the first instance, on co-operation and synergy between the bodies and institutions under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I wish to set in train a programme of specific actions that will enable Ireland to more effectively address the needs of overseas and domestic tourists who wish to experience Ireland's cultural and artistic resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">At the meeting of 11 February, I asked the relevant agencies to take a number of specific measures that will enhance the availability of information on cultural attractions and events, both in marketing material and also the on-site provision of information.  I have also established a network through which State agencies and institutions in the arts, culture and tourism spheres will interact with each other to identify and capitalise on opportunities to further develop Ireland as a destination for cultural tourism.  A small steering group, drawn from a representative group of the heads of agencies and officials from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, has been established to identify specific actions to be undertaken in order to increase Ireland's attractiveness as a destination for cultural tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">The Government is committed to the development of niche cultural tourism markets, as outlined in the recently published Building Ireland's Smart Economy document.  Cultural tourism is growing in importance internationally.  It has been achieving average annual growth rates of 15% — three times the overall growth rate for tourism.  It represents a third of all tourism business and is high yield.  It is essential that Ireland positions itself as a premier destination for the many tourists for whom experiencing culture is an important component of their holiday.  I am confident that the measures being taken will strengthen the arts and culture family and help the Irish tourism industry to address the current challenges and boost business in future years.</p>

            <p eId="para_238">I welcome that the Minister is having those meetings because I believe a large part of the future of tourism lies in the cultural area as all the research indicates.  I was surprised that so many bodies were involved which makes me wonder whether this area is so fragmented that it is inefficient.  In addition I was surprised at the omission of others who would have had a big input into that, for example tour operators, who are out selling Ireland on their own behalf and obviously are bringing visitors home.  The other big player missing — maybe the newspapers failed to report it — was the OPW, which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of our heritage sites and attractions.</p>

            <p eId="para_240">I have previously raised the role of the OPW with the Minister.  It must recognise that we are all in this together and that these facilities must be made available.  One of my colleagues recently went to visit Kilmainham with a bus load of people and was told — owing to the cutbacks I presume — that they would need to wait an hour and a half for a tour with the result that 40 people got back on a bus.  The entrance fee was lost and whatever else they were selling was lost, and a bad impression was gained.  There is no sense in investing in these facilities and then not letting people in to see them and making the most of every opportunity to get money out of them.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_148" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_241">I agree with the Deputy and I would be very regretful about such incidents.  I have no reason to disbelieve her that that was the experience of those people.  I do not know why it happened.  I do not know whether it was a one-off incident for some specific reason.  However, I take the point.  If we are to be serious these things need to be in place for seven days a week in a seamless way.  They need to be open on public holidays, which is when people want to be there.  The Deputy is right in identifying this as a big part of our tourism product.  More than €3 million of our €8 million went specifically towards cultural tourism.  Some 60% came from abroad, which is the right mix.  There are more coming in and that will probably even increase.  Some 40% came from the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_242">I have spoken at length on the issue of opening times.  Private sector businesses would be open because they are trying to make money to survive and pay their staff.  They want to provide a good product.  That is recognised.  There was very substantial improvement in recent times on the way things were run up to a few years ago which was almost on a five-day week closing at 5 o'clock basis, which was utterly unacceptable.  We now need to get to the next level and be fully open at the times people expect, as we expect when we go abroad.  We expect to be able to walk into a museum or cultural institution and would be surprised if it was closed.  The same applies to people coming here.</p>

            <p eId="para_243">As a former Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, the Minister has first hand experience.  What is the possibility of having many of these facilities opened throughout the year and not just on a seasonal basis?  Tourism does not start on 17 March and finish in September or October.  It is critical to have all the available facilities open throughout the year, not only for visitors coming from abroad but also to help develop our own sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">On the heritage side of things, much work has been done by the OPW under various Governments throughout the years in developing facilities like Kilmainham, Newgrange and so forth.  There are many others, including in my part of the country, the historic capital of Connacht, that have not been utilised and developed to their full potential.  What is the feasibility of these?  While I understand the difficult financial circumstances, if we are going to develop new products, there is huge potential in regard to heritage sites that have not been fully developed and made available to the public.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_246">It is right that the aim should be that every facility should be open 12 months of the year.  We would all accept there may be some smaller facilities where it would not be realistic to achieve that, but the aim should be to achieve it.  A substantial number of projects, large and small, have been identified throughout the country to enhance the product.  A number of those are in State ownership, which would make them the direct responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  To be fair to the OPW, it has not been slow about working up the plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_247">I will not deny there is a current difficulty with the budgetary position with regard to implementing some of those proposals but, nevertheless, my attitude is that we would keep pushing ahead.  If we need to go to planning, or whatever we need to do, let us keep doing what we are doing and prime pump everything.  Some money will be spent so it is not a case of none being spent.  Even from the tourism side, the product development fund is still there, and while it is not as big as we might like it to be, it is helping projects to develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">The Deputy is correct that because we market Ireland with an island-of-Ireland approach, we need to have that necklace of regional activity so that people who come into Northern Ireland can also visit the mid-west, and those who come into the south-east can also visit the North and see the attractions of the whole island.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">Deputy Olivia Mitchell rightly raised the point that there are a number of good bodies which operate under broad umbrellas, such as the Town and Country Homes Association, the Irish Georgian Society and specialist mansions.  While they are all well-meaning and do good work, none of them on their own can market internationally in the way they should.  There should be an overall branding so we can put all the resources into one marketing campaign, and these bodies can exist underneath the surface.  It is not feasible and it is poor organisation to maximise the cost of trying to bring a global image worldwide by marketing all of those bodies.  It is possible to do this, not by spending more money but simply by using what is in all the little pots and putting it together.  The sum of all the parts will create much more than having these bodies operate individually.  In particularly tight times, every penny must be maximised.  This is how some of that will be done and more of it can be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_250">While the OPW is not the Minister's direct responsibility, tourism is.  I understand the OPW gets a budget to run its facility, pay guides and so on but it does not retain whatever income it takes in at the door so there is no incentive for the sites to either stay open even for the month of April, never mind a full year, or to open late.  Will the Minister have discussions with the Minister of Finance to ensure the money the OPW takes in stays there in order to pay the guides and keep the sites open and available to visitors when they want to see the facilities?</p>

            <p eId="para_253">If the Deputy is suggesting there should be a further ownership incentive in terms of reward for the activities they undertake, I would not disagree with her.  That is why, to some degree, there might be better structures working in the private sector.  I do not know the possibilities of this.  I can mention it to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">The Deputy is correct in the fundamental point that close co-operation is vital to maximise all the activity.  As she said almost in exasperation at the beginning, and I can empathise with her, there are so many bodies we wonder at times are we doing the right thing.  It is clear there is much enthusiasm but we could maximise the benefit much more than we are doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_255">The value to Ireland of the awards that are being won internationally, be it by actors, museums or otherwise, is incredible.  We could not buy the coverage this gives to the country in terms of promoting Ireland as a first-class tourism destination.  Our cultural institutions contain people who operate in the broad cultural areas, such as drama, the visual arts and so on, and they are invaluable in delivering tourists into this country.  We must recognise and sustain that.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I saw the Taoiseach had a bit of a gathering at the weekend and I noted some of the comments from there.  I am not sure that the Minister for Transport suggesting everybody in the banks is akin to Oliver Cromwell is the right way to go.  It begs the question as to where Queen Elizabeth is in all of this.  Cromwell was only acting on instructions.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">In respect to the Taoiseach's comments about his job, his job is not just to calm the nerves of his own party or party members, it is to reassure the Irish people about their future economic prospects and the landscape that lies ahead.  With respect, to date, the Government has not shown any competence to do that.  Every time a financial target is set by the Government, it has been way off target.  Examples of this are that prior to October, the budget deficit was projected to be €5.8 billion but in the budget it was €10 billion and in January it was €18 billion, even after the pension levy.  In reality, the figures have been very much higher than the Government projections.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Exchequer returns for the end of February will be published in a few minutes' time and I am sure the Taoiseach has been briefed on them.  I would like him to tell the House, as it should be told, what those figures are and whether they are consistent with the projections of the Government at the time of the budget and in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Last week I called for the need to face the reality of the difficulties facing the public finances and stated there is a need for a new budget.  To that end, the Fine Gael party put down a Private Members' motion, to which the Government has appended its amendment.  Part of that Government amendment states, "notes the Government decision today to announce further necessary measures by the end of this month to ensure the stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances".  What are these measures?  What decisions were taken by the Cabinet today?  How will this decision or these decisions go towards allaying people's lack of confidence and lack of trust in Government in that there are no figures with regard to reducing borrowing for 2009, 2010 and 2011?  These are important questions to which I hope that Taoiseach can give a comprehensive answer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_158">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_263">What I had to say over the weekend was addressed to the Irish people — everybody.  I did not get involved in any party-political jousting whatever because of the seriousness of the situation we face.  I therefore do not accept the Deputy's critique.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The substance of the Deputy's question relates to the Exchequer returns for the end of February, and they are disappointing.  It is clear that tax revenues in 2009 are under pressure.  We are in a very serious situation, as we have been outlining, and a serious economic downturn.  As was clear to me from my attendance at an EU meeting on Sunday in Brussels, the European Central Bank and the Commission will also be revising downwards their forecasts for the European economy, as this global recession continues to bite hard everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Deputy has referred to the counter motion tabled by the Government in which we indicate that by the end of the month we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the framework we have set for ourselves, that is, a 9.5% general Government deficit for 2009, will be adhered to.  It is important for the credibility of the country that we do so.  Before the end of the month we will come forward with whatever measures are necessary, either in terms of expenditure savings or tax raising measures.  The end of February returns reveal a figure of €5.759 billion, as opposed to €7.562 billion for the same month last year.  We are committed to restoring the public finances to a sustainable position and action will be taken to ensure the deficit will not worsen from the forecasted figure of 9.5%.  We have indicated what the first steps taken were.  Further measures must be taken by the Government during the course of the year.  I hope to set out a more medium term position by the Government in order that the people will be able to see the scale of the challenge and what must be done to deal with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I would have expected the Taoiseach to provide the figures for the Exchequer returns to be published in a few minutes' time and indicate whether they were consistent with the projected €18 billion deficit announced in January.  Also, I would have expected him to tell us what decisions were taken by the Government today as referred to in the Private Members' motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The problem throughout the country is that no one can plan for the future.  No business can plan for investment because it does not have a plan or strategy from the Government.  People do not know what the Government's intentions are in respect of borrowing reductions in 2009, 2010 and 2011.  That is the reason it is necessary to face the reality that the public finances are under extreme pressure.  A fair and comprehensive budget is needed covering all sectors to allow the people to buy into it.  If they knew the scale of the problem and that their contribution was going some way towards dealing with it, they would be prepared to get back to a point where they would have some confidence where there is none.  It is the duty of the Taoiseach to set out the economic landscape for the next three to five years.  That landscape is bleak.  Therefore, people do not confidence to invest or spend.  That is what is causing the crisis of confidence in their personal and business lives.  It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach to deal with this.  This is the forum of the people.  Will he provide the figures for the Exchequer returns which are due to be published in a few minutes' time?  What do the figures mean?  Is the figure €18 billion or greater?  What decisions did the Government take this morning?</p>
          <p eId="para_268">In the amendment to the Fine Gael Private Members' motion the Taoiseach "notes the Government decision today to announce further measures by the end of this month to ensure the stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances".  Is that simply a decision to announce action at the end of the month, or is it a decision that will at least make some effort to stabilise and sustain the public finances?  That is the crisis of confidence.  There is no point screaming blue murder about every sector without setting out the Government agenda, plan and strategy for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  If the people could see the economic landscape in so far as the Government can predict it properly and make decisions about it, they could at least plan their lives and businesses in such a way that investment, confidence, fairness and opportunity could be restored.  In respect of the decision taken by the Government today, will the Taoiseach indicate if it will take the form of a series of announcements to be made at the end of the month?  Will he inform the House of the decisions made this morning to enable us to begin debating them and in order that the people will understand that at last, following Fine Gael's call, there is a strategy or plan in place for 2009, 2010 and 2011?</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I have given the returns figure — it is €5.759 billion at the end of February 2009 as opposed to €7.562 billion at the end of February 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">There is a strategy in place which we have outlined to the European Commission, as required once we exceed the Stability and Growth Pact 3% deficit limit.  We have indicated that between now and 2013 it is our intention, through a combination of tax increases and expenditure savings, to reach a situation where €16.5 billion will be taken out of the equation.  The gap in the original end of year Exchequer returns is €55 billion in expenditure and €37 billion in taxation.  This is the third month of the year and tax revenues are already under pressure.  It seems there could be a shortfall in revenues of between €2.5 billion and €3 billion based on the figures if the profile were to continue for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The decision taken by the Government in respect of the figures which have emerged today indicates clearly that we must stick within the fiscal strategy we have set for ourselves.  Further measures must be taken to keep within the 9.5% deficit figure we have set ourselves for 2009.  We have indicated in the documents to the European Commission the further savings that must be made in future years.  I have indicated to the House that we should try to set a three year parameter to manage the situation in so far as it is possible to predict it, as the Deputy said, in a downturn which continues and which is deteriorating.  The global recession is having an impact everywhere, including the European and USA economies, among others.  We have made the decision that we will make whatever adjustments are necessary to meet the emerging deficit in this year's figures by the end of the month.  We received the figures today and must consider them and produce a plan to deal with them.  That is what the Government intends to do.  We are indicating that we will make decisions at the end of the month.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_273">Do I understand correctly from what the Taoiseach stated that the revenues for this year will be €34 billion or €35 billion, as opposed to the €37 billion, of which he previously spoke?  He says the Government has taken decisions and that all of this will be addressed by the end of the month.  By what means does the Government intend to address the issue by the end of the month?  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to have the Minister for Finance bring a new Budget Statement before the House before the end of the month?  Will he clarify what he means by the end of the month?</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Although, understandably, we have concentrated on the macro-economic big picture and spent a good deal of time addressing it for several weeks, we sometimes forget the human side of what is occurring.  There is one area, in particular, I wish the Taoiseach to address, namely, the decision announced by the Department of Education and Science on 11 February to the effect that it would be withdrawing funding from special needs classes which did not meet a certain pupil-teacher ratio.  There are 118 classes and 528 pupils affected by this decision.  The amount involved is €7 million.  Given the scale of the figures we are discussing, it is relatively small and eminently fixable.  The Minister for Education and Science stated this is being done, not for financial reasons, but for educational reasons.  In a letter to the newspapers recently he stated the children concerned would be better off in mainstream rather than special classes.  There is an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which lists the case studies of several of the children concerned and the comments made by their parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Róisín Woods points out that her seven-year old daughter, Jessica, has just now managed to pronounce her own name and her mother wonders what it would be like if she were in mainstream education, coping in a class where she would be teased about the fact she could not pronounce her name.  Cathy Shevlin says that at ten years of age her son, Niall, with the mentality of a four-year old, is expected to go into fourth class in a different school and to sit with 30-plus pupils.  The newspapers have reported on the case of Christine Devine and her six-year old son, Aaron.  Christine Devine says that the teacher would have to take her son to the toilet every half hour.  Damien Barry says that mainstream school was never really an option for his daughter, Alana, as she has too many problems.  The McBride family have said their daughter, Chloe, is much happier now and doing really well.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">These are parents who are extremely worried about their children.  They want their children to stay in the special needs classes in which they have been accommodated to date and where they are doing well and making progress.  I am sure that, given all the issues that need to be addressed, the €7 million required to deal with this matter can be found by savings of one kind or another.  It would not take a great deal of ingenuity nor would it be difficult to put that together.  I appreciate that solving the overall problem of the country's finances is a huge task but there are things that can be fixed.  There are little things like this that do not have to happen, little things that make a lot of difference to parents and their children as in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I ask the Taoiseach whether this decision can be reversed.  The House will be discussing the Exchequer returns and what has to be done about them but there has to be a sense communicated to people that the little things can be fixed.  This can be fixed and it does not have to go ahead.  These children can and should remain in the special needs classes in which they are doing well.  This cut can be reversed and I ask the Taoiseach to give hope to those parents and to their children that the compassionate view will be taken and that the effort will be made to find the savings.  We could find €7 billion for investment in the banks and we are talking here about a figure of €7 million, one thousandth of that cost.  I am sure this can be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">Deputy Gilmore will be aware that he may raise only one issue on Leaders' Questions.  I assume, therefore, he is asking for a reply on the question about special needs.  He cannot have two questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">The Government and Minister for Finance made it clear at the publication of the end of February returns that the Government would make decisions at its meeting at the end of March and whatever legislative arrangements need to be made beyond that date can then take place.  The political decisions will be taken after full consideration by Government in the next few weeks to deal with the current financial situation as it emerges.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">On the question about children who have been in special classes, there is an educational view to be considered.  I understand the concerns of parents.  In many cases these special classes had fewer children per teacher, less than the ratio of 11 to one per teacher.  The idea is to group classes at local level to achieve the ratio of 11 to one.  I wish to clarify that this proposal does not affect severely handicapped children as it relates only to those with mild to moderate learning difficulties.  There is a strong educational view that interaction in the mainstream classroom is helpful, in addition to any special or particular individual support they will receive.  Support teachers and staff are in the schools to assist in mainstream classrooms and this was not a feature ten or 15 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I am aware this issue has arisen.  The Minister has indicated the thinking behind the proposal.  The purpose is to ensure those children will obtain the care and attention in the mainstream classroom they received in the special classes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_282">Do I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that the Government and the Minister for Education and Science will not change position?  I have read what the Minister has written about it, his response and his view that there is an educational case for moving the children concerned into mainstream classes.  With the greatest of respect, their parents disagree.  The children are in special needs classes at present and that is where their parents want them to remain.  What is the Taoiseach saying to the parents of those children?  Is he saying the Government is sticking by the decision that those children will be moved out of the special needs classes and into mainstream classes?  Will he respond to the case I am making that the Government should reconsider this decision and those children should be left in the special needs classes and whatever accommodations and arrangements are required should be made?  The parents of these children are looking for an answer; they are not looking for the educational theory which may or may not be right.  Incidentally, the educational argument is a cover, in my view, for what is a financial issue.  Will the children stay in the special needs classes or will they be taken out of them?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_283">The answer is as I have said.  It is proposed that children at local level can be grouped to maintain a special class and raise the ratio to 11 pupils to one teacher, which is regarded as the best configuration.  This can be worked on.  We will seek to achieve this arrangement in a way which is consistent with the educational principles——</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_285">It is a question of providing a better educational environment by having interaction between children and having a larger number in the classroom instead of isolating two or three.  This is regarded as a better solution than the arrangement that was developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the past.  This is the thinking behind the proposal.  </p>
          <p eId="para_286">This is not about finances but rather about trying to ensure best practice.  I understand and respect what parents have to say.  In our constituencies we all meet people whose children are in a particular location or set of circumstances and there is always an understandable reluctance to change the arrangements.  However, there are educational issues to be considered and there is a need for departmental personnel and teaching staff to work closely with parents to try to reduce to the greatest extent possible any anxieties they may have about new arrangements, and to ensure the outcome for the children in the educational setting is at least as good as, or hopefully better, than the current arrangements.</p>

Just €300,000 in funding was allocated for 2009 to cover both public advertising and the price of calls and the Minister has confirmed that the more calls it receives, the more successful it is, and the earlier the problem will disappear.  This low-cost and successful initiative is being cut in the context of very real community fear as regards the reporting of drug related crimes perpetuated by Garda corruption, as evidenced in the Boylan case broadcast on RTE's "Prime Time" last night, and despite the very high human and economic costs of drug-related crime.</p>

We have indicated that we will meet and make political decisions based on what is emerging to ensure we come in with a 9.5% deficit to the end of the year.  Whatever requirements are made arising out of those decisions will be taken in the House in due course.  That is the decision the Government took today and when we take further decisions we will inform the House further.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_419">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I thank the House for agreeing to discuss this Bill at short notice.  The Bill is needed to allow the State through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, to invest in Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland under the terms of the recapitalisation programme announced by the Government on 11 February and debated in the House the next day.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The House will be aware of the international context in which this action is being taken.  The past 18 months have been unprecedented in terms of the pressure states and financial institutions, banks in particular, have been under throughout the world.  Market expectations with regard to the capital that banks should hold have altered significantly.  As a result, banks have needed to compete vigorously for deposits and other forms of funding in a weakening economic environment.  They have been forced to seek capital in a difficult market resulting in an array of state interventions, including recapitalisation programmes across the developed world.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The extended financial crisis has brought home to all of us the pivotal role that the financial system plays in supporting the economy.  In turn, it has become clear to all that it is essential for the Government to take appropriate action to maintain the stability of the financial system.  Like many other European countries, Ireland has moved to ensure the security and stability of its banking system.  Throughout this process, our approach has been based on two basic principles.  First, the State will not let any systemically relevant financial institution fail and, second, any State involvement in financial institutions will protect the interests of the taxpayer and have regard to legal implications and European requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Government's approach has been a considered response to a financial crisis that has resulted in state interventions across Europe and the world.  Through the bank guarantee scheme, we created a space to assess the further measures needed to best protect our financial system in a strategic manner.  In view of the continuing turmoil in global financial markets, the Government initiated intensive discussions with Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland with a view to securing their positions.  This resulted in the announcement of the recapitalisation package on 11 February.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">As Deputies will recall, under the recapitalisation programme, the Government will provide €3.5 billion in core tier one capital for each bank.  Of the total €7 billion, €4 billion is to be funded from the National Pensions Reserve Fund's current resources while €3 billion will be provided by means of a front loading of the Exchequer contributions to the fund for 2009 and 2010.  These investments will remain part of the fund and the return earned on them will accrue to it.  Funding the bank recapitalisation programme in this way strikes a prudent balance between, on the one hand, addressing an urgent economic priority and, on the other, continuing to take account of long-term budgetary stability and the sustainability of our pension system.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The total amount to be invested, €7 billion or €3.5 billion for each bank, was determined following detailed consultations with financial and property experts involving consideration of likely trends in asset values and various stress scenarios related to those.  The State's investment will significantly strengthen the core tier one capital of the two banks, bringing it well in excess of regulatory limits.  The State will obtain a direct return for its investment on specified terms and the banks have agreed to a customers' package containing a number of measures to improve lending in the economy, including statutory codes on business lending and mortgage arrears and a €100 million fund to support environmentally friendly investment and innovations in clean energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">In return for the overall investment, the Minister obtains preference shares with a fixed dividend of 8%, payable in cash or ordinary shares in lieu.   These preference shares can be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of the issue and at 125% of face value thereafter.  The Minister can appoint in total 25% of the directors to both banks and he obtains 25% of total ordinary voting rights in respect of change of control and board appointments.  Warrants attached to the preference shares give an option to purchase up to 25% of the ordinary share capital of each bank existing on the date of issue of the new preference shares.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The recapitalisation will ensure the two main banks in Ireland are in a position to provide necessary commercial credit facilities to their customers and the economy generally.  In line with this, the banks have committed themselves to increasing lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers this year.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.  To ensure that credit is extended in an appropriate manner, statutory codes of practice on business lending and mortgage arrears have also been finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Our recapitalisation programme will strengthen Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland as financial institutions central to the economic future of the country.  The Government is also in discussion with other relevant institutions about their respective capital positions and will take whatever measures are judged necessary in that regard at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">As Deputies will be aware, the NPRF was established in 2001 for the purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from 2025 until 2055.  As the Minister for Finance, I am required under the relevant legislation to pay 1% of GNP into the fund every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The principal purpose of the Bill under discussion is to amend the 2000 Act to facilitate the recapitalisation of financial institutions.  The Bill amends that Act so that, in respect of credit institutions listed on a stock exchange, the Minister for Finance may, in the public interest and in particular circumstances, give directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to make investments in such institutions and to underwrite their share issues.  It may also give directions on the holding, management and disposal of such directed investments.  An investment in a listed credit institution made by the commission on foot of a direction from the Minister is referred to in the Bill as a "directed investment".</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Bill will enable the Minister to make additional payments into the fund for the purpose of a directed investment in a listed financial institution and to transfer into the fund a shareholding or other interest held by him or her.  If the total payments or transfers in any one year are greater than 1% of GNP, the excess will count towards the requirement to make annual contributions to the fund in future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">For example, this year, the annual contribution from the Exchequer to the fund will amount to approximately €1.6 billion.  This amount was provided for in the 2009 budget last October.  The €3 billion contribution from the Exchequer to the cost of the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland will be composed of the €1.6 billion and an additional amount of some €1.4 billion that will count towards the Exchequer contribution to the fund in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Bill has a number of other provisions.  Perhaps the most notable is the proposal to amend the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 to provide for greater transparency in terms of trading in financial instruments.  This provision will enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations requiring certain information relating to transactions in financial instruments to be disclosed to the Financial Regulator, the market or both.  The intention is that this will allow the introduction of regulations requiring disclosure of contracts for difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Let me turn now to the provisions of the Bill in more detail.  Sections 1 and 2 contain the usual standard provisions necessary to explain certain terms used in the Bill.  Section 1 links the Bill to the 2000 parent Act while section 2 amends the Act by inserting definitions of a number of technical terms used in the Bill, such as a "Commission investment vehicle", "directed investment", "listed credit institution" and "regulated market".  Section 3 extends the functions of the commission so as to enable it to manage directed investments.  It amends the commission's functions to take account of the investments to be made by the commission in accordance with a direction by the Minister for Finance.  It enables the commission to have regard to such directed investments when determining the investment strategy for the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Under the 2000 Act, the commission is precluded from investing in Irish Government securities.  Section 3 contains a technical provision to clarify that the reference in the principal Act to those securities means debt instruments issued by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Currently, the commission can only accept contributions from the Central Fund.  This section will enable the commission to accept funds or assets for the benefit of the fund from sources other than the Central Fund if so directed by the Minister.  This technical provision is the counterpart of the provision in section 6, which will allow the Minister for Finance to transfer shareholdings and other assets to the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">This section of the Bill also enables the commission to advise the Minister at his or her request on a proposed directed investment.  This will, for example, enable the commission to carry out the necessary due diligence on Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland before the actual recapitalisation.  The Bill will also enable the NPRF Commission to underwrite issues of securities.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I am including this measure in the Bill on an enabling basis, lest the need arises to have the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission underwrite a capital raising issuance by a financial institution.  I must emphasise this is not something I propose to do; I am merely taking the opportunity to include the provision on a contingency basis now that the NPRF legislation is being amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Bill also allows the commission to form a company or other body corporate.  This will allow the commission to set up special purpose investment vehicles where it is more efficient for the commission to invest through such a structure.  At present, the commission is precluded from controlling a company.  Section 15 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 prohibits the commission from controlling a company or acquiring a shareholding of such size that the commission would be required to seek to take control of the company.  This is appropriate given the purpose of the fund as the commission's role is to invest for the optimum return and not to get involved in managing companies.  However, it is necessary to lift this restriction in two instances, the first being when the commission sets up a special purpose investment vehicle as I have just described.  The second is where the commission is required to invest in a credit institution on foot of a direction from the Minister or, in other words, when the commission is facilitating the State recapitalisation by investing in the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I should emphasise at this point that the State does not intend to take control of the recapitalised financial institutions.  The recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland is to be based on the State taking preference shares in those institutions, rather than ordinary shares.  However, if the fund was to underwrite a future share issuance by these institutions, it is possible that the fund's overall holding could constitute a controlling interest.  Once again, I must emphasise this is not something I propose to do; I am merely providing for it in the Bill on a contingency basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I am proposing that certain statutory provisions in company and takeover law should not apply where the commission is required to invest on foot of a direction in the public interest in a financial institution as part of the recapitalisation programme.  The proposed amendments would ensure that investments by the NPRF in the financial institutions on the scale now envisaged would not be impeded by procedural delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Accordingly, section 5 of the Bill provides that certain provisions of competition and takeover law and section 7 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 do not apply in respect of an acquisition or proposed acquisition by the commission of an interest in a traded credit institution or a transfer into the fund of the Minister's interest in a listed credit institution, if the acquisition or transfer results from a directed investment.  Section 7 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 essentially provides that the Minister for Finance is to take over the role of the Competition Authority in respect of the merger or acquisition of a credit institution in the current banking crisis.  I am providing that this section will not apply where I am directing the NPRF Commission to recapitalise the credit institutions on the basis that it is not necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The section also provides that nothing done by the Minister, the commission or a commission investment vehicle for the purposes of a directed investment in a traded credit institution will constitute a reorganisation measure for the purposes of certain European Communities regulations.  The Bill seeks to ensure that contracts previously entered into between recapitalised banks and third parties are uninterrupted so as to permit the orderly continuation of the banks' operations, notwithstanding that the shares in, and control of, the bank have transferred to the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Section 6 of the Bill amends section 18 of the principal Act in a number of respects.  First, it amends section 18(2) of the principal Act by allowing the Minister to make the annual contribution of 1% of GNP in a lump sum or in instalments at any time during the year, rather than in equal quarterly instalments.  The Act of 2000 provides for a contribution from the Exchequer to the fund each year of an amount equal to 1% of GNP, to be paid in equal quarterly instalments.  To allow more flexibility, I now propose a technical amendment in order that the annual contribution need no longer be paid in equal quarterly instalments.  This change would, for example, allow the Minister to pay the contribution in a single instalment early in the year, if funds were required in the context of bank recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Second, section 6 amends section 18(5) of the principal Act to enable the Minister to transfer into the fund a shareholding or other interest held by the Minister or his or her nominee, for example, the National Treasury Management Agency, and to contribute to the fund by paying a sum into the fund.  Third, section 6 provides that such transfers or contributions may be taken as satisfaction or part satisfaction, as the case may be, of the Minister's obligation under section 18(2) of the principal Act to make annual payments into the fund.  If the total contribution exceeds the amount required to be paid into the fund in any one year, the excess shall be taken in satisfaction or part satisfaction of the amount required to be paid in any subsequent year.  Fourth, section 6 provides that stamp duty shall not be chargeable on any instrument giving effect to a transfer by the Minister into the fund.  As ownership of the fund is vested in the Minister, there is no basis for stamp duty being payable when the Minister is transferring a shareholding in his name to the commission for it to manage and invest on his behalf.  Section 6 also provides that any commission investment vehicle which may be established is owned by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and is responsible for the investment of the national pensions reserve fund, subject to the level of risk involved being acceptable to the Commission.  This effectively is a commercial investment mandate.  The concentration of significant investment in a particular sector or small number of institutions could be construed as contrary to this strictly commercial mandate.  Accordingly, section 7 amends section 19(1) of the principal Act so as to provide that the commission's strictly commercial investment mandate will not apply in the case of directed investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The preparation of this draft legislation provided an opportunity to consider once again the position regarding ethical investment.  As Members will be aware, when the fund was being established, the scope for introducing an ethical investment policy was considered at length.  In the event, it was decided that it would not be practical or appropriate to constrain the fund in this way and, consequently, the NPRF legislation provides for a commercial investment mandate without an explicit ethical component.  In the intervening years, there has been significant debate on the issue within institutional and sovereign investors as to how they should be expected to invest the funds they manage on behalf of the ultimate owners of those funds.  There have been considerable developments in thinking in this area and the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission has itself taken a number of initiatives to integrate environmental, social and governance considerations into its management of the fund.  In the light of this ongoing debate and having regard to the experience of other countries with sovereign investment funds, it is my view that this matter requires further consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Given the sensitive and urgent nature of the legislation now required to facilitate the recapitalisation of the financial institutions and the complexity in drawing up a responsible investment policy that will work in practice, it would not be appropriate at this time to include such a provision in this Bill.  However, given the importance of the subject and to advance matters, I will establish an interdepartmental committee to examine the issues further.  The group will report to me within three months of its establishment and will be open to receiving the views of interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Section 8 is the key section in the Bill as far as recapitalising the credit institutions is concerned.  I have indicated previously that I intend that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission should be the agent of the State in providing the additional investment needed to capitalise the financial institutions.  This will require the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to be amended to give the Minister for Finance the power to direct the commission to make, hold and dispose of investments in the financial institutions as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Accordingly, section 8 amends the principal Act to provide that the Minister, in the public interest, having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority, may, in specified circumstances, direct the commission to invest on specified terms and conditions in certain listed credit institutions and to underwrite or otherwise support the issue of securities in such listed credit institutions.  The section also enables the Minister to give a direction to the commission on the holding, management and disposal of, and any voting rights attaching to, a directed investment on such terms and conditions as are specified in the direction.  The exercise of these powers will be subject to the normal EU state aid approval process.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">This section also provides that the Minister, the commission, a commissioner, the manager of the fund and staff of the manager shall not be taken to be shadow directors within the meaning of section 27(1) of the Companies Act 1990 of a company or its subsidiary in which the commission has made a directed investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Section 9 of the Bill amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide that the same exemptions from taxation that apply to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission shall apply to any "commission investment vehicle", as defined in section 2 of the Bill.  Section 10 amends the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007 to clarify that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and any commission investment vehicle which may be established are not subject to the regulations.  This is a technical provision.  For the avoidance of doubt, it provides that the commission and any commission investment vehicle are not investment intermediaries in their role of investing the fund on behalf of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I propose to amend the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act 1995 to facilitate the winding-up of Ulysses Securitisation plc.  This is a securitisation vehicle which was established in 1995 to borrow for the Exchequer using the cash flow from local authority mortgages to guarantee repayment of the bonds issued by Ulysses Securitisation plc.  The bonds issued by the company have been repaid and it is now proposed to wind up the company.  The provision proposed in section 11 of the Bill is a technical change to the legislation to facilitate the winding-up of the company and provide that any remaining assets of the company on its winding-up will be transferred to the Minister for Finance or to such other body as he may direct.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">I am still searching.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The Bill includes a provision amending the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 to enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations requiring that certain information relating to transactions in financial instruments must be disclosed to the Financial Regulator, the market or both.  Certain financial instruments can be used to acquire an economic interest in the shares of publicly listed companies without acquiring direct control over, or ownership of, such shares.  Such financial instruments are increasingly used by investors to avoid disclosure of their economic interest in a particular company.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">There has been particular controversy regarding the use of contracts for difference, CfDs, which, unlike share transactions, do not need to be reported to the market, unless the contracts explicitly provide a right to acquire or give access to voting rights.  The provisions in section 12 enable the Minister for Finance to make regulations to require all those who have entered into transactions in financial instruments to disclose certain information relating to those transactions to the Financial Regulator, the market, or both.  The provision covers all financial instruments in order to cater for possible future market developments, but the intention is to make regulations covering CfDs in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The decision to recapitalise Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland is a clear indication that the Government is fully prepared to stand behind the banking system.  We have embarked on a comprehensive recapitalisation programme for our financial institutions which will reinforce the stability of our financial system, increase confidence in our banking system and facilitate the banks involved lending to the wider economy.  Our actions send a clear message to customers, investors, credit rating agencies and the markets generally that Ireland is a safe and secure place in which to do banking business.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">In preparing this legislation, I was anxious to convey another important message.  The existence of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is taken into account by those who lend to Ireland.  The amendments to the legislation that have been brought forward in the House have been brought forward on the basis of minimal change to the existing legislation.  The argument has been canvassed in the House as to whether we should take a holiday from making a contribution into the fund when we are operating from a position of Exchequer borrowing rather than surplus.  It should be borne in mind that the front loading of the contribution means the essential investment which must take place in the banking system will allow us further space to consider this issue in the next two years.  Therefore, it is not necessary to decide on this issue at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">It is worth noting that the fund has substantially depleted in value as a consequence of the global decline in stock values.  The sums that are available to finance the recapitalisation from the fund are liquid assets which can be realised easily.  It has been canvassed in other quarters that the fund could be applied to some greater national purpose.  However, the realisation of the remainder of the fund would come at a considerable cost because it is denominated in equities and other stocks which have depreciated in value and which would, in effect, have to be sold on a fire sale basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">We support recapitalisation but in a different form.  This House is charged with ensuring value for taxpayers' money.  The Bill facilitates the allocation of €3.5 billion to both AIB and Bank of Ireland.  To compare, the pension levy will yield €1.4 billion in a year, according to the Minister's figure, and the income levy will provide €2 billion.  The Taoiseach indicated in the House earlier that some €2 billion to €3 billion will have to be raised by way of additional taxes or reductions in expenditure.  Taken together, these measures will produce almost €7 billion for the Exchequer.  This helps to illustrate the scale of the allocation of taxpayers' money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">We all agree that the banks must be recapitalised.  We all agree there are problems in terms of liquidity and solvency.  However, we must ensure value for money and we must ensure the scheme is effective.  The results announced yesterday by AIB show that with the €3.5 billion recapitalisation from the State, its tier one capital ratio would be in the order of 8.5%.  Without the recapitalisation, however, it is below the minimum level of 4%.  Looking forward to 2009, the bank foresees a bad debt write-off of between €2.9 billion and €4 billion and an operating loss for this year of some €121 million.  In addition, each bank will have to pay €280 million in terms of the preference coupon.  We are looking at a situation where, unless international markets change significantly, the banks may well be obliged to turn again to the State in search of additional funding.  This is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Fine Gael has argued for a "good bank" model.  The Minister has acknowledged the issue of toxic debts and so on and has indicated a willingness to look at this type of model in the future.  Our proposal is very straightforward.  Under our model, AIB and Bank of Ireland would each retain their toxic debt, but two new banks, New AIB and New Bank of Ireland, would be established, each of which would take all its parent bank's deposit liabilities and good assets in terms of commercial and residential loans.  The newly created good banks would help to inspire confidence in the international markets.  The problem is that the banks are retaining——</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_484">No, our solution requires the setting up of good banks.  Is the Minister saying he regards the level of bad debt in the banks to be in the region of €15 billion?  What exactly is the Minister saying?  This is about finding something the markets will believe in, in respect of the banks, their solvency and dealing with bad debts.  The Minister may disagree with the model Fine Gael proposed but we believe it will work.  What is proposed here is extremely worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">With regard to positive aspects of this legislation, I welcome the fact that the Minister is dealing with contracts for difference.  The Quinn group was not legally required to disclose its dealings with Anglo Irish Bank to the Financial Regulator and this caused major difficulties for the bank.  I hope the legislation will have substance and we will examine the matter on Committee Stage in order that contracts for difference are required to be disclosed and what happened with the Quinn group and Anglo Irish Bank will not happen again.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will establish an interdepartmental committee to establish how bodies make investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Fine Gael takes issue with a number of aspects of the scheme.  I refer to the announcement by the Minister for Finance on 11 February that the shares would be perpetual non-cumulative growth preference shares for €3.5 billion core tier 1 funding.  The Minister should have considered these shares being cumulative preference shares and that the Government would have discretion in any year to decide whether the bank could afford to pay the dividend.  There are two worrying elements to this.  The banks will pay €280 million per year as a dividend for preference shares.  If the banks redeem €1.5 billion of this State investment, the new preference shares, before 31 December 2009 the markets would worry that the banks would not be able to afford to do that.  This puts unsustainable pressure on the banks and the Government should have opted for cumulative preference shares with discretion on the matter of whether the banks are in a position to pay dividends.  The option of redemption by 31 December 2009 should not be included because it puts undue stress on the banks.  The Minister referred to the banks redeeming up to €1.5 billion of the State investment in new preference shares from privately sourced capital prior to 31 December 2009.  The worry we have is that it will put pressure on the banks.  It is unlikely that they will be able to source tier 1 capital from private sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">AIB is capitalised to the value of €406 million and Bank of Ireland has €201 million.  We are putting €3.5 billion into the two banks for a 25% potential stake if the coupon dividend is not paid.  This values the banks at €14 billion but that is not the case.  With regard to the money being invested in the banks, we are worried that we will end up with zombie banks because the main concern of the banks will be the shareholders and funds will not flow to small businesses and first-time buyers.  Overall that is the essence of the recapitalisation scheme and that is why we proposed the good bank model.  This would allow a bank to function as a fresh bank and to go to the market in terms of liquidity and raising private funds.  The State could consider putting ordinary shares into a good bank because it would be viable and the State could receive a return in future years.  The problem is that we have a bank with assets that comprise a combination of toxic debts and good debts.  We still do not know what is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Fine Gael has concerns that the State is putting €1.6 billion from the Exchequer and borrowings into the National Pension Reserve Fund on a yearly basis.  That is creating pressure and the Minister should consider a holiday until we reach 3% of Government deficit to GNP.  There does not seem to be criteria on how the NTMA will account separately for the performance of normal investments along with directed investments.  There must be transparency and accountability because this concerns €7 billion being invested in the banks under the direction of the Minister for Finance rather than a decision by the National Pension Reserve Fund.  Fine Gael will refer to this matter on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The Bill gives the Minister the power to bring forward payment to the fund from future years.  This allows immediate recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  This power should be curtailed for this reason only.  The Minister has referred to the Government's contribution to the National Pension Reserve Fund being in the form of cash from the Exchequer or investments in lieu.  The Minister must clarify what he means by these investments and whether he refers to shares in companies such as the ESB.  This measure is clearly specified in the legislation and we require clarification on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The good bank model is critical for the international markets.  Deputy Richard Bruton has espoused this point of view.  In the context of the international markets, State capitalisation should require a clean-out of existing management teams and the appointment of new boards.  There should be a cap in the order of €250,000 on executive pay.  The CEO of AIB is still receiving approximately €670,000.  In giving confidence to the public about the recapitalisation scheme, there should be a new broom.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">We need a full overhaul of financial regulation in Ireland.  I note the Taoiseach's comments at the weekend about effectively merging the Central Bank with the Financial Regulator.  We await specifics on that but what is required is that the board of the Financial Regulator be removed and that a new financial regulator — preferably someone with international experience — be appointed.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet in that we want the banks to work.  We want recapitalisation to work; we do not want the two main banks seeking further State investment in a few months' time.  The worry is that the measures provided for here could bring about that.  I refer to the announcements by AIB and Bank of Ireland about their bad debt provision for 2009 and 2010 and the situation they will face in terms of paying the coupon, which they can roll into ordinary shares.  They will certainly try to repay the preference shares by the end of 2009.  The buy-out of preference shares by the end of December will create pressure.  We must get this right.  A model should be put in place that will work and give confidence to the international markets, that will not bring about zombie banks but a situation where funds will flow to small business and mortgage holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In the terms of the recapitalisation scheme the Minister speaks about an increase of 10% in capacity for small business and 30% for first-time buyers.  The worry I have is that proposals from small business will be looked at up to a particular sum and that funds will not be given beyond a certain capacity.  It is critical that the Minister looks to have published the number of small business loans approved by banks versus the number turned down and the level of funding provided.  The terms should also be made public.  I have people coming to me who are involved in small business.  They may require restructuring facilities but the banks are increasing the interest rates charged to the customer.  Every other loan is being restructured at much higher rates.  The problem is that the people concerned cannot go to other banks, as competition is effectively dead and banks are concerned more with protecting themselves than providing funds for small business.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The Minister should take our concerns on board.  We have argued that we want a good bank and a cap on salaries for top officials in banks.  We are not getting value for taxpayers' money but must get some guarantees from banks with regard to the flow of funds to small business and first-time buyers.  We may find ourselves in a position where we will have to come back here in a number of months because funds will not have flowed to small business.  What view will the Minister take if the banks come back in three, four or six months and indicate they require more funds?  That is the decision we are taking today with the model proposed.  The worry is that the banks will look for extra funds and that the required statement will not be sent to international markets.  We will deal with this issue in much more detail on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Despite the evident lack of interest in this legislation, in many respects it is little short of cataclysmic.  We would regard it as such in other times, although at this stage we may consider we have seen it all and cannot be shocked further.  This is another sacred cow, self-evident truth and core principle being turned on its head and perhaps jettisoned altogether.  I refer to the pensions reserve fund which, despite some recent losses, represents the last tangible evidence that there was a Celtic tiger and that we were capable, as a country, of providing for our future and pensions.  It was a small cushion that we could salvage from the years of the raging Celtic tiger.  We are being asked to raid that fund in order to save the banks.  More than that, we are being asked to purloin the contributions for the next two years, amounting to €3 billion.  The way it is referred to suggests the sum of €3 billion in the next two years will be given at no cost but in reality the money must be borrowed at far from favourable rates, if the Government is capable of borrowing that much.  That is one sacred cow but another is the absolute independence of the National Treasury Management Agency which is also being breached.  The agency is being directed, at the whim of the Minister, to make investments in financial institutions.  I use the word "investments" advisedly because I do not believe they are investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The sum of €7 billion is not mentioned in the legislation but we are enabling the Minister to direct that this amount be invested.  We are being asked to vote to allow him to direct the National Treasury Management Agency to invest in any bank up to any value; we do not know the figure the Minister will direct the body to invest.  It is an absolute reversal of the terms of the original legislation under absolute independence was given to the agency to make financial investments only in the public interest.  It was completely independent of the Minister of the day.  Under this legislation, the Minister, without further recourse to the Dáil, will have full authority to order the purchase of any amount of shares in AIB or Bank of Ireland, which amounts <i>de facto</i> to nationalisation of the banks.  We may be moving in that direction but I hope not, as the implications will be enormous for the country.  If the dust ever settles, we must have a viable financial services sector.  If we want to have anything more sophisticated than a sub-post office, we must be very careful before we go down that road.  Whether we eventually go down it, we cannot bury the matter in this legislation.  That step is too big and must be clearly flagged and discussed, and only taken after every other option is fully explored.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The Government persists in calling this an investment of €7 billion but nothing could be further from the truth.  An investment would be entered into freely with the expectation of some reward.  Even the Government in its most optimistic mood would not genuinely expect a reward, not in our lifetime or within a reasonable timescale.  If it does, it is not dealing in reality.  The process is not being entered into freely.  The players are being brought, kicking and screaming, at a time of the banks' choosing, for an amount of their choosing and probably on their terms.  That has been the nub of the problem.  I am sorry the Minister is not present to listen to what I have to say, as the Government has not taken control of the financial crisis, any more than it has taken control of the fiscal crisis.  At every stage, by the time it eventually took action, the nature of the crisis had changed so much that the solution was already inappropriate, too little, too late and always extremely costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">As my colleague has noted, Fine Gael is opposing this measure.  It is akin to pouring money into a pot with a hole in the bottom.  Perhaps it will give us a brief respite from market disbelief regarding the state of the banks' assets but it will not last long.  There is a reprieve while the markets turn to eastern European banks but the pressure will return, unless we take the action that sends messages of confidence.  Even if such messages were sent, they would do absolutely nothing to achieve our goal of increasing the level of credit provided for small business.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Reading today's newspapers, by AIB's own admission its liquidity ratios will be adequate when the bank is recapitalised.  In other words, the recapitalisation is required to reach the liquidity figures required by law.  If the banks need this capital, they will hoard it rather than lend it to business or those seeking mortgages, etc.  It is a fallacy that that goal will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">My colleagues, including the party leader, as well as Deputies Bruton and O'Donnell, have made suggestions in good faith about the direction we should take.  I ask the Minister to listen to these suggestions, as something must be done about extending the guarantee which is as damaging as anything else in terms of confidence in the banks.  There is also the model of a good bank to consider in recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The approach and measures we must take should be dictated by what the end game is and what we want to achieve in the long run, not by the minimum measures necessary to get us through next week or the week after and certainly not by dancing to the tune of the banks and the level of interference they find acceptable, but that is what has been dictating the Government's approach.  It has been listening to the banks on each occasion in terms of what they need rather than what the country needs and where we need to get to.  The attrition rate of this approach in terms of confidence in the banks, the economy and the Government is enormous.  It is sapping the Government's ability to solve any of the problems facing us.  Its drip, drip approach, as I mentioned, is always too little, too late and is sapping the lifeblood of the country, financially and psychologically.  It is utterly debilitating, enervating and destructive and has to end with some decisive comprehensive action, not only for the banks, important as that is, but also to address the country's finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Government has been in denial about the country's finances in recent months and the gaping hole in our finances has increased in size from €5 billion to €10 billion to €15 billion to €18 billion.  Today we find it is €20 billion.  Does anybody honestly believe it will end there?  It will not stop increasing, unless the Government takes decisive action.  It can dress it up any way it likes, but we are facing a third budget within one year.  How can we expect ordinary people to plan their lives and finances and have realistic spending plans if they do not know what will happen with the Government's finances and what it will spend.  How can businesses plan in a climate of such uncertainty?  This incremental piecemeal approach is destroying and killing the country and must stop.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">I mean no slight on the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, in saying it is disappointing that there is no economics Minister present in the Chamber when we are discussing a measure of such fundamental importance for our future.  I understand the Minister for Finance may be doing media work in the context of the announcement of a mini budget, but this measure involves a sum of €7 billion for the banks.  Several Ministers and Ministers of State have direct economic responsibilities.  While I have no objection to the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, being present, as he is just doing what he was asked to do, I find it insulting and an appalling comment by the Government, particularly given the repeated suggestions made by members of the Government that the Opposition has not been co-operative enough.  This is the forum in which we can speak and make comments on what the Government is proposing to do and if it is so arrogant in not even wishing to bother hearing what we have to say, it makes co-operation very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I have before me a useful timeline published in the <i>Irish Independent </i>some weeks ago.  On 23 October Mr. Eugene Sheehy, the chief executive of Allied Irish Banks, declared that the bank would not be looking for cash from the Government or shareholders and said they would rather die than raise equity.  How is that for a capitalist warrior going into the breach and saying they would rather die than raise equity?  On 5 November Allied Irish Banks slashed its profits forecast and indicated that it expected to write off €2.35 billion in loans, mainly to property developers in the past few years.  Fast forward to yesterday when the same Mr. Sheehy was rather more subdued when he admitted a worse case scenario for the bank in the next few years of €8.5 billion in bad debts.  This followed on the heels of its sister bank, Bank of Ireland, which made an announcement that it expected to have a broad bad debt provision in the next few years of approximately €6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Government is putting €7 billion into the two banks — €3.5 billion per bank.  I asked when the recapitalisation announcement was made if what was being done was adequate.  Some €8 billion and €6 billion make €14 billion.  The first question for the Minister is what are the economics of what he is doing?  We should bear in mind that is not about saving the vanity of the various senior executives involved but about getting credit flowing to businesses.  I am sure the Minister of State will have seen today in the February Exchequer returns that excise duties and VAT returns are down considerably.  If one is in business, a fall in excise duties and VAT returns means that business activity is way down because importers have reduced their imports.  As a consequence, there is paralysis in the country such that people are nearly afraid to paint their front room, they wonder if they can afford to do so, if it is sensible for them to do so, if they will have a job, or if they would they be better off putting their money under the mattress or saving it in a bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This is the last in a series of measures the Government has put before us and none of them has done the trick.  We need to recognise that the Government has failed miserably in all its attempts, namely, the bank guarantee scheme, cited as the cleverest measure in the world when introduced at the end of September, bringing forward the budget in October, the announcement of the recapitalisation scheme and of a variation of it, the announcement of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the announcement that the banks would not be able to raise more capital but that the State would up its capital investment to €7 billion.  In counting these measures on my fingers, they number seven.  Today another measure was announced — a mini budget.  The pension levy legislation was passed last week.  After counting all these measures on my fingers, I have only one finger remaining.  All these measures were meant to fix the problems facing us — the lack of fiscal stability in the public finances and the recapitalisation of the banks.  I will not even begin to talk about the disaster of unemployment stalking the land with people losing their jobs or income due to having their hours of employment reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">At the time of the announcement of the bank guarantee scheme the Government would not acknowledge that property developers and the golden circle had been central to the fall in our fortunes, but Allied Irish Banks stated yesterday that it had loaned €5.4 billion to 30 developers.  Mr. Sheehy said only four or five clients — I love the way bankers talk, they should write novels — owed the bank more than €500 million each.  What a charming concept.  They are photographed in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, taken after these announcements and before their nice lunch — given all the humble pie they have had to eat, I am surprised they needed lunch also — against the background of a well known painting in a well known hotel across from Government Buildings.  It is a beautiful painting by Jack B. Yeats.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, will know it——</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_510">It is entitled, "A Race on Hy Brazil".  The Government is permanently sequestered on Hy Brazil.  I do not even think "A Race on Hy-Brazil" by Yeats is providing them with inspiration because they just do not get it.  The measures announced today indicate that the banks are laughing all the way to the bank because the Government has yielded to them on almost every point.  The small measures that the Opposition sought which would make so much sense for business and employment and put manners on bankers are not included.  The Government is in Hy-Brazil and we have not been answered.  The Bill contains no measures to get credit flowing or apply conditionality to the injection of the sum of €7 billion, which is essential.  It is good that the banks are coming forward with clear and honest statements of what has been happening.  Inevitably, with the scale of losses they have incurred, how will they provide funds for existing and new businesses to sustain employment?  It is incredible that this matter does not feature in the Minister's speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I repeat what I said on 30 September and in early October.  The Labour Party has a very simple proposal, which is that bankers' salaries, compensation or whatever they call it should be capped at the same salary and compensation package of the Minister for Finance.  That salary stands at approximately €250,000.  Ministers receive expenses of €60,000 to €70,000 and have a chauffeur driven car.  In my language, that means a Minister's total package is worth approximately €350,000 which is remarkably similar to the figure President Barack Obama has come up with for bankers in the United States.  In order to incentivise the people concerned — if they only understand incentives — a review clause could be inserted stating that after two or three years when they have brought the banks back to health we could consider giving them a Christmas box or something like it.  It would not be a bonus but something modest that would reflect our thanks for what they had done.  We want a capping of bankers' remuneration to be provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Minister has announced today that he will hit the people with a mini budget, probably by the end of March.  The people need reassurance that these masters of the universe are to feel some pain.  While I cannot feel it, I can understand the pain felt by Mr. Goggins when he announced that his earnings would be cut to below the €2 million mark.  Yesterday standing under the painting "A Race on Hy-Brazil" Mr. Sheehy was devastated that his income was falling to €700,000.  I can understand that if one's lifestyle is pitched around earnings of €2 million, €700,000 does not sound fantastic.  The people, like most Members, believe is an extraordinary amount of money, that it is excessive and that it should be reduced.  I do not care what the CIROC is doing.  It just needs to do it and bring bankers' salaries down.  They need to be capped in order that the little people who will be asked to cough up in a mini budget will see that the bankers will also pay.  As they are wealthy, they should pay proportionately more than those on small modest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">We have had no detailed figures from the Minister to indicate why he believes the €7 billion recapitalisation figure is adequate.  I am concerned that more will be required and that the Bill does not require the Minister to come back to the Dáil.  We want a clause inserted in it requiring him to come back to the Dáil for approval.  The terms of the Bill describe them as directed investments.  Once these investments are made in the banks we want an annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In effect, after we have invested €7 billion in the banks, we will own them.  They will be nationalised in all but name because the device used is one of preference shares.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">We are also concerned that the recapitalised banks will be protected against acquisition until the State has recouped its money.  It would be quite possible for a clever capitalist — a hedge fund or private equity operator — to decide to buy ordinary shares.  While we know it would be subject to the credit institutions financial support scheme, what is to stop a high flyer in a private equity or hedge fund buying up stocks of the two banks at very cheap prices, then taking over the banks — because that is what is provided for in the Minister's scheme — and saying to the taxpayer, "Off to Hy-Brazil with you.  You are getting nothing."  Where is the upside for the taxpayer?  From the details of the Bill, there is no evidence that we are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">During the two-year but renewable lifespan of the guarantee for the covered institutions, the Minister will have the power to revoke the guarantee if an institution is taken over.  Article 13 of the scheme states the Minister may revoke the guarantee in whole or in part after consultation with the governor and the regulatory authority.  However, section 5 of the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill reverses section 7 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act.  I am not sure whether this has become clear to the Minister.  In other words, the special rules relating to the merger or takeover of guaranteed credit institutions do not apply to the investment by the pension fund on the Minister's behalf in the two banks.  However, these special rules will continue to apply to a subsequent merger or takeover if it is only the State investment that is not covered by the rules under section 7.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Section 7 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act is a good example, which is worth highlighting in debate, of how rushed law makes for bad law.  Its purpose is to modify competition law in its application to covered institutions.  This was intended to facilitate mergers by providing for ministerial rather than Competition Authority scrutiny and approval.  The mistake in the section is that it creates a special procedure to fast-track approval by the Minister of mergers and acquisitions to which the section applies in covered institutions.  However, it defines mergers and acquisitions to which the section applies by reference to the Minister's certified opinion that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_517">(i) the proposed merger or acquisition is necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system in the State, and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_518">(ii) there would be a serious threat to the stability of that system if the merger or acquisition did not proceed,</p>
          <p eId="para_519">In other words, the Minister cannot consider a proposal for a merger or acquisition unless he is first notified of it, considers it, seeks additional information on it, if necessary, consults the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank and the Competition Authority, invites submissions, appoints a competition adviser and ultimately decides whether to approve or refuse the proposed merger or acquisition.  This elaborate procedure only applies to mergers and acquisitions to which the section applies, being ones which the Minister has decided are necessary for the stability of the financial system of the State.  The definition puts the cart before the horse.  On the basis of our legal advice, if the provisions of the section were ever invoked, it would be absolutely unworkable.  It is another example of rushed legislation being bad legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I am also disappointed that the Bill only applies in regard to the investment in the banks in terms of the financial stability of and the financial crisis in the State.  It makes no provision whatever for investment, for example, in necessary elements in the State such as required public infrastructure.  In other words, what is left of the fund will continue to invest in equities throughout the world, from Hong Kong to Australia to the United States, in products as diverse as armaments, cigarettes and anything else one fancies, because it is all managed in diversified funds by fund managers who get handsome fees amounting to approximately €20 million a year.  In the meantime, while there are very good projects in this country with an absolutely recognised and viable rate of return, there is no way of using anything from the pension funds to invest in those particular projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I am extremely disappointed by the Bill the Minister has produced.  In a democracy, there must be public and social consent for what happens.  As I said, today's announcement is the ninth attempt in terms of banking and stabilising the public finances.  We seem to be set on a course where the banks have got everything they wanted in this recapitalisation proposal whereas the modest proposals put forward by us to cap bankers' pay and insist on conditionality being put in place in regard to credit for small and medium businesses in particular, as well as larger businesses, and have this addressed either by way of designated funds or otherwise by direction of the Minister, have been left out.  It is difficult for people not to be very cynical about how partisan the Government has been when it is continuously on the side of rich bankers, not on the side of families working hard to put their children through school and build a life for themselves.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_522">The Minister in particular drew our attention to sections 6, 8 and 12 of the Bill.  I will start at the back and make reference to section 12, which concerns the amending of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007.  In his script, the Minister drew our attention to the fact the purpose of this is to provide in particular for the situation that has risen with regard to contracts for difference, CFDs.  It could theoretically apply to other instruments and derivatives already in existence, or perhaps yet to be created, but in particular it is intended to deal with this issue of CFDs.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I welcome that measure.  It introduces a badly needed element of transparency and obligation on the person concerned to disclose certain information.  While I do not know on whom is the obligation to disclose certain information relating to such transactions to the market, the Financial Regulator and the public — whether it is on the person accumulating the CFDs or on the company — I certainly welcome it as a step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I do not have any wish to criticise Mr. Seán Quinn who is a major employer in this country.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, I had occasion to authorise his insurance company and I have had the opportunity to visit it and see the very large number of people employed there.  He is a very important employer.  However, what happened in the case of Anglo Irish Bank has done untold damage to our reputation outside of this country.  Even Fianna Fáil has gone from describing it as "disappointing" on day one to describing it at the weekend as being akin to the damage wreaked by Cromwell, which is one hell of a distance to travel in a short time.  However, it is a positive measure in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I wish to come back to the point made by Deputy Burton in regard to the covered institutions.  Will the Minister when replying deal with the issue of what now is the position with regard to the mutuals and the building societies?  I was horrified to find that even a well-managed, conservative organisation like the Educational Building Society had decided to get in on the property business at the height of the market, just in sufficient time to make significant losses in the context of that company's overall loan book.  If assistance is required for the EBS or Irish Nationwide, where one reads it will definitely be required, how will the Minister support that?  Will it be by way of guarantee or by way of underwriting a bond?  We would need to be told how he proposes to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">I also ask the Minister to address the issue touched on at page 5 of his script, where he draws our attention to the fact the commission can only accept contributions from the Central Fund and explains that this section will enable the commission to accept funds or assets for the benefit of the fund "from sources other than the Central Fund".  What is envisaged in this regard?  Is the Minister anticipating there that moneys may be forthcoming from sources other than the Central Fund?  Does this envisage the disposal of State assets elsewhere?  Does it envisage the disposal of State holdings in, say, a company like Aer Lingus or the privatisation of other State companies, for which there is occasionally a clamour outside and inside this House?</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I would like to know what is the position because when one looks back at the Act we enacted before Christmas, one will find the Minister was laying the ground then for the possible recapitalisation of the covered institutions, notwithstanding that he vehemently argued at the time that he was not and that recapitalisation was not required.  Now, when one looks back, that is the main Act and this Bill is really only invoking its terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">In that regard, I draw the Minister's attention to the question raised by Deputy Burton on whether €7 billion will be adequate.  She made a compelling case for the Minister to come to the House to give a considered reply to that question given the history of this entire saga since 29 September.  Is the answer to Deputy Burton's question that the Minister intends to come back?  It is very interesting to note that, under the original Act, if this is done by way of scheme, the Minister must come back to the House but if it is done by agreement with the individual institution, he is not required to come back to the House.  If Deputy Burton is correct and the figure is inadequate, then the Minister, without reverting to the House, can enter into an agreement with a specified covered institution.  Notwithstanding the enormity of the decisions we are now making, somewhat casually, the Minister is not obliged to revert to the House at all.  We have grown accustomed during this crisis to making such decisions.  I recall that we won a commitment from him for a scheme on the floor of the House, although I understand this was not originally envisaged by his minders.  Nevertheless, he conceded given that he is an agreeable man.  However, the position is that he can extend the €3.5 billion to a particular institution, or he can cause it to be extended to a new covered institution, provided it is not a mutual institution, without reverting to the House at all.  We should hear from the Minister on that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">These debates are entirely inadequate to deal with the issues that are before us.  I note that the Minister is required to talk to or consult the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  Up to now, I have not made much comment about the regulator because, by and large, I believe public servants do the job they are allowed to do.  However, the more one examines the matter, the more horrified one becomes at the role of the regulatory authority.  I note the emergency decision made by the Taoiseach before the Ard-Fheis, which permitted us no opportunity to properly discuss the issues involved.  There was some brief discussion at the time that the senior counsel, Mr. Michael McDowell, made his report on regulation.  A hybrid was born which has failed, with tragic consequences for the country.  The Taoiseach went ahead notwithstanding and announced a new configuration without any discussion and it is a matter that we must discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I do not agree with the comments of my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, to the effect that perhaps the 8% coupon was punitive on the individual banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">That is incorrect.  The point is that they may not be able to repay it in terms of liquidity and solvency ratios.  It is not punitive at all.  In fact, they should pay more.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_533">That is a different point.  When Mr. Alastair Darling initially dealt with this issue the coupon was 12%.  It turned out to be unsupportable with the objective of stabilising the banks and it was too punitive.  Taxpayers find that having devoted a share of national wealth to the pensions of the future, that pension money is now going toward the banks.  Many people have great difficulty in understanding that, although we must say that without a functioning banking system we cannot have a functioning recovering economy.  In that sense it seems if the Minister is reassuring us about capital adequacy ratios, that a coupon of 8% ought to be capable of being borne.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I was greatly amused at the weekend by the huff into which Fianna Fáil fell about the preposterous notion that anyone should associate that party with developers and such people.  Whoever was responsible, there is manifestly no basis for such a claim.</p>

I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak. <i>Ulysses</i> is always difficult to understand, however one reads it.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to enable the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to make investments in the public interest in listed credit institutions and it amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the taxation of such investments.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established with great foresight by the Government of the day and under the careful eye of the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, in 2001.  The original objective of the National Pensions Reserve Fund was to meet as much as possible the costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 onwards.  Demographic projections indicate that the age structure of the population is due to undergo a major transformation in the coming years.  The proportion of persons of working age relative to those greater than 65 years of age is projected to fall from a current 5:1 ratio to less than 2:1 by 2050.  This will inevitably put severe strains on the capacity of future Governments to continue to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The National Pensions Reserve Fund represented a move towards a part pre-funded public pension system.  It involves the statutory setting aside and investing of 1% of GNP annually.  Currently the fund is valued in the region of €16.5 billion.  Late in 2008, due to a number of factors, national and international, and coupled with the ongoing turmoil in global financial markets, the Government initiated intensive discussions with several banks with a view to securing their position.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The Government decided on a comprehensive recapitalisation package, which will reinforce the stability of our financial system, increase confidence in the banking system here, and facilitate the banks involved in lending to the economy.  Every day we hear of the difficulties of viable small and medium enterprises in accessing credit and cash.  Such small and medium sized enterprises are struggling and must be given support.  This measure will go some way towards doing so.  Further steps will be required in addition to the steps already taken.  There is no magic wand and no one silver bullet that will solve everything.  Everything cannot be neatly packaged into one small box and rolled out on one day.  Given the current turmoil and the meltdown of the financial markets it is very difficult to predict what will come next.  I note the comments of an economist who stated that what was needed was small steps not giant leaps.  This measure is one small step that will assist the economy and small and medium enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The purpose of the Bill is to allow moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to be used for this programme of recapitalisation and I support this proposal.  The plan will see €3.5 billion invested in each bank, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, in return for preference shares with a guaranteed dividend of 8%.  There is concern in some quarters that 8% may not be sufficient but it was the case in other countries that a higher dividend had to be reduced subsequently.  This dividend is balanced and good and the Government will also have the right to appoint one quarter of the number of directors at each bank and obtain one quarter of ordinary voting rights at board meetings.  In return for the funding, both banks have agreed that bonuses for staff will not be paid for activities in 2008 and 2009.  While salaries for senior executives will be cut by at least 33%, the banks have also agreed to increase lending to small business by 10% and to first-time buyers by 30%.  This will be welcomed by all those involved and those who appreciate the serious demands on small and medium enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">An effective banking system is vital for business and consumers alike and is essential to Ireland's economic recovery. The recapitalisation of these banks will have a positive impact on the ability of businesses to acquire finance and maintain business activity.  Recapitalisation will boost confidence and will send a strong message to the domestic and international business community that Ireland is a safe place in which to do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Businesses are really struggling.  The reduction in gas and electricity prices is a very good step and must be a great relief to both the residential and the business consumer.  Businesses are finding it difficult to pay rent and rates and local authority charges.  In Grafton Street, not too far from here, there are proposals for bids for district improvement which is also adding on charges for additional services.  While these services are very welcome and the bids concept is a good proposal, it imposes a heavy burden on many businesses which are already struggling.  I heard of one landlord who was seeking to increase the rent.  It is amazing that anyone would try to do that at this time——</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_559">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  We must recognise the integral importance to the economy of a properly functioning banking system.  We cannot have economic recovery unless the banking system works for its customers and is in a position to lend credit to personal customers, to small and medium-sized enterprises and to large companies.  The success or failure of this recapitalisation proposal will be measured by the extent to which it allows credit to move through the economy again.  As part of the proposal, the lending capacity to small and medium-sized business is to be increased by 10% and an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers will be provided in 2009.  It is one thing to provide capacity for extra lending but this does not necessarily equate with actual additional lending.  I ask the Minister to ensure there is follow-through on the extension of credit to ensure the extra capacity translates into credit being extended into the market.  Judging from the advertisements in the newspapers from institutions it is quite clear they are now more enthusiastic about taking in deposits than in providing credit and this has to change.  It is to be hoped that this recapitalisation initiative will help to achieve that result.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I met a motor dealer recently who told me that a couple of years ago the refusal rate from car financing houses to personal loan applicants was in the region of 20% whereas now it is up to 65% to 70% refusal rate.  Many of these applicants are legitimate with no bad credit history and would be in a position to meet the repayments but it is clear there has been a shift in thinking and in the practices among the institutions regarding the availability of credit.  The recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland will have to result in credit being extended to our economy again so that we can work our way through the current recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">There has been much comment as to whether €7 billion is sufficient and from reading the various articles which were provided by the research service of the Oireachtas Library it is clear there is a divergence of opinion as to whether €7 billion is sufficient and whether the entire principle will work.  It is clear that the Minister has taken this decision very seriously and has consulted with the appropriate authorities such as the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority and has had extensive negotiations with the institutions over the past number of months resulting in the Government decision to proceed with this recapitalisation.  I welcome the code of practice on business lending and mortgage arrears which is being finalised.  I look forward to a more understanding attitude by the main banks towards personal customers who run into difficulties with repayment of mortgages which were secured at highly inflated values in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">It is essential that confidence is restored in the banking system and this must be a national political priority.  Since the outset of the global financial turbulence, the Minister and the Government have made it clear that the Government will stand behind the main financial institutions which are of systemic importance to our economy.  The Minister has made it clear on many occasions, including in his speech on Second Stage, that the Government will not allow any institution of systemic importance to fail.  This is an important statement from the Government and it will help to reassure investors and the markets that the Government is serious in its intentions.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_565">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_566">That Dáil Éireann recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_567">the current Government strategy for restoring the public finances, the banking system and wider economy has failed to secure public support or international confidence, and that both the Irish public and international financial markets funding the banking system and our Government are losing patience;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_568">unless we urgently take new measures to stop Government borrowing from spiralling out of control, other measures to support our struggling small businesses, exporters and job seekers will have little effect;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_569">the Government no longer has the luxury of the time needed for the long consultation processes by advisory groups before taking further decisions on public spending, reform and taxation in 2010;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_570">calls on Government to introduce a new budget for 2009 as a matter of urgency that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_571">sets out specific measures to substantially cut the €40 billion Government borrowing requirement for 2009 and 2010 that is being forecast by most commentators;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_572">is ambitious, wide ranging and comprehensive in its scope;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_573">is fair in its execution by showing what role is being played by all groups in society, particularly those who are in the best position to contribute more;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_574">offers radical reforms to our budgetary system to squeeze out waste and poor value for money;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_575">looks not just at spending cuts but at additional tax and other revenue raising measures that can drag our public finances back under control."</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I wish to share time with Deputies O'Dowd, Ring, Coveney, Creighton and Feighan.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I move the motion in respect of restoring stability to the public finances in my name and that of all Fine Gael Deputies.  Last week the Tánaiste said the public finances were under control.  The announcement by the Taoiseach to the House today that the public finances could be out by €2 billion by the end of the year clearly means that they are actually spinning out of control.  According to some estimates, Exchequer borrowing this year could be as high as €25 billion, with general Government borrowing of around 13% of GDP, including the cost of bank recapitalisation.  That means we can expect to borrow somewhere between €21 billion and €25 billion by the end of the year.  Without further decisions, borrowing will remain at this level in 2010 and 2011, leading to a tripling of the national debt by comparison with 2007 levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">No other country is suffering from such a rapid and uncontrolled deterioration in its public finances.  This is because the last Fianna Fáil-led Government, under the direction of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, then Minister for Finance, allowed public spending on unreformed public services to rise dramatically on the back of a temporary and unsustainable tax windfall from the overheating property sector.  The disappearance of this tax windfall which, according to some estimates, had reached €15 billion by 2007, has left an enormous structural deficit in the public finances which will not be repaired by a return to normal growth rates alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">While many things need to be done to stop the haemorrhage of jobs and improve the situation of struggling businesses, exporters and job seekers, nothing will have enough of an impact, unless we take the hard decisions now to mend the broken public finances.  This is because the jobs crisis, the shortage of bank credit and the spiralling Government deficit are inextricably linked for two particular reasons.  First, the banks cannot lend money that they do not have.  They do not have easy access to funding because, as the public finances continue to deteriorate, international markets are losing faith in the Government's guarantee that they will be repaid in the event that the banks run into difficulty.  Banks, therefore, have problems in terms of liquidity and, as a consequence, in lending and extending credit lines to businesses.  Second, the rapid budgetary deterioration is leading to fear and uncertainty among businesses and consumers regarding future tax rates and Government spending.  This is generating paralysis in investment and consumption decisions that is killing economic activity and jobs.  Uncertainty is always the enemy of stable economies.  The fact is that people cannot budget for their households from one month to the next.  They do not know whether their children will be able to continue on to third level or if they are facing tax increases.  There is no picture as regards the economic landscape that lies ahead.  Businesses do not have any idea as regards what the borrowing requirement or the reduction in the national debt will be in the period 2009 to 2011.  If business does not have a perspective on the economic landscape, it cannot project for investment purposes or as regards the running of its affairs.  That uncertainty, confusion and paralysis caused by the Government is a major cause of the lack of confidence in business, both family enterprises and SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">That is why it is long past time for the Government to bring to an end the current state of denial and prevarication.  Its strategy for the public finances and wider economy is clearly failing, and both the public and international markets funding the banking system are losing patience with it.  The world outside wants a clear message that Ireland has changed direction and that there are reasons for believing in the Irish banking system and financial institutions.  My view is that an election would give a mandate in providing such clarity, but obviously people are welded together and the numbers speak for themselves.  Other countries have achieved very successful turnarounds, including Sweden in the 1990s, by taking decisions that were broad, comprehensive, fair and frontloaded in areas where the pain did not continue interminably.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The current strategy for the public finances, centred on the public sector pension levy and the updated stability framework for the period 2009 to 2013 fails on two grounds.  There are no specific measures apart from the public sector pension levy.  This has fostered the impression among public servants that they alone are being asked to carry the burden of budgetary consolidation.  While Fine Gael has long argued that the public service payroll must be reduced in order to fix the public finances, it is unfair and self-defeating to present this element of fiscal consolidation in isolation from other measures.  There are also clear anomalies in the pension levy that reinforce the impression of unfairness among the lower paid, as the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, knows.  Public servants have been pilloried.  I respect the work they do.  They want to work in a service that is efficient, meaningful and lean and which gives them job satisfaction.  They come to me as leader of Fine Gael and point to areas where there is wastage on a daily basis right across the State sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The lack of any guidance to families and businesses as to how the Government intends to repair the public finances in the coming years is hurting consumption, investment and employment.  People and businesses need visibility and a sense of the economic landscape ahead before they will make decisions on savings, investments, house purchases and pensions.  One cannot expect otherwise.  Uncertainty is always the enemy of stable economies and the air of uncertainty and drift surrounding the Government are killing economic confidence.  That is the message the Minister of State needs to understand.  Economic confidence is killed stone dead by Government prevarication and its refusal to face reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The updated stability framework for the period 2009 to 2013 has not served to restore trust in Ireland's credit worthiness among international lenders because there is too little detail and most of the adjustments are back-loaded, deferred to 2011 and beyond.  Of the estimated €16.5 billion in fiscal measures of tax increases and spending cuts planned by the Government in the next five years, €10.5 billion has been deferred until after 2011.  It is like the decentralisation programme.  While nobody would expect the budgetary hole to be filled in one year — after all, it took the Taoiseach four years to destroy the public finances — the extent of the back-loading creates the perception of a Government which does not have the political confidence, legitimacy and credibility to take the hard decisions needed to put the public finances back on track where everybody wants them to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Time is running out.  Both the public and the international financial markets are losing patience with the Government's inability to present a credible economic recovery plan.  We cannot delay any longer, with the €20 billion hole in the public finances facing us and getting bigger each day.  We no longer have the luxury of having the time needed for long consultation processes by Government advisory groups before taking further decisions on public spending, reforms and taxation in 2010.  It is better that we take decisions quickly for ourselves rather than have outsiders do it for us later this year or in 2010.  This is about protecting Ireland's financial sovereignty and independence.  The Minister of Finance has echoed these words on a number of occasions in the recent past.  It is time to face up to this reality.  That is why it is vital that the Government should announce now that it will within the next month deliver a new budget that will substantially cut the €45 billion Government borrowing requirement for 2009 and 2010 combined being forecast by most independent economists.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The Fine Gael Party will enter the debate constructively.  Nothing is off the table.  Given the continuing deterioration in the public finances, to be credible it is necessary to implement new measures this year, on top of the public sector pension levy, to reduce borrowing by a further €1 billion, to be followed by a programme of expenditure cuts and tax increases of €5 billion next year.  Taxation measures alone will not deal with this problem.  What is vital is that the Government sketch the measures to be taken in both years, with the details of the measures planned for 2010 being elaborated on in the forthcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">There are possible measures that could be considered, including a carbon tax of €25 per tonne from April.  That would save €500 million in 2009 and €750 million in 2010.  National recovery taxes, for instance — one point on the top and standard rates of tax — would save €500 million in 2009 and €750 million in 2010.  The suspension of public sector pay increments would result in a saving of approximately €250 million.  Given the tax buoyancy effects, these changes would cut Government borrowing by just under €1 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">There are additional measures that Fine Gael has already pointed out, including a cut in the cost of the national drugs bill — approximately €200 million — in moving from branded to generic drugs; a carbon windfall tax, referred to by Deputy Coveney on many occasions, on the ESB of approximately €300 million; a cut in the FÁS budget for in-company training of approximately €150 million; a voluntary redundancy programme targeted at back-office public servants — approximately €250 million; a 5% cut in public sector pay for those earning above €100,000 which would bring in €100 million; additional efficiency measures in current spending across all Departments resulting in a saving of €1 billion; price reductions in capital programmes resulting in a saving of approximately €1 billion; and cuts in personal and PAYE tax credits resulting in a saving of approximately €1 billion.  Additional taxes are obviously being considered by the Government in the property sector and so on.  All of these issues need to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The people are willing to face up to the problem provided they know its scale.  They are also willing to contribute to having the problem sorted out but want to know two things in particular — first, that their contribution will go towards sorting out the problem and, second, that it will be dealt with fairly.  That means that instead of hiding behind the worsening reality, the Government will deal with it because it will only get worse if it does not.  From that perspective, our view is that a new budget should be introduced which is broad, comprehensive, fair and will deal with the full range of issues that must be addressed.  Dealing with it from a taxation perspective alone is only one measure that will not cover the entire scale of the problem.  The issue of current spending must be examined, in particular, waste and inefficiency, to ensure we will have a public service that responds to people's needs, represents value for money for the taxpayer and is responsive in terms of where we must go.  That means dealing with the banks also and, as a consequence, the issue of confidence to ensure job investment, creation and protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">There are enormous opportunities in the health, energy and construction sectors.  These are issues the Government should be facing into with confidence but what the people need is a plan from it that sets out the economic perspective over the next three years to ensure business can invest with confidence, that we can protect and create jobs and get back to a point where confidence can be given to consumers, families and business and Ireland can begin to trade again, as it did previously.  That will be a very painful process in the next few years but it must be dealt with.  From that perspective, Fine Gael calls for a new budget to deal with the new reality.  Every issue across the spectrum should be debated fully in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_590">I draw Members' attention to the fact that for this most important debate on one of the most critical days in our economic cycle given the very bad news we received today there sits not one senior Minister, Deputy, Green Party Deputy, former Progressive Democrats Deputy or one of their supporters on the Government benches.  They cannot all be hiding.  Some of them are probably fleeing the country in their helicopters.  The fact is they are not here because they may not want to face the music before us.  If they are listening, I invite them to come into the House.  We will tell them what it is like but they will not escape the wrath of the people in the forthcoming elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">What is happening is that the hopes and dreams of all our young people and their families are being shattered before our eyes.  The queues outside dole offices are not just made up of labourers and working class people but bricklayers, IT specialists, graduates, doctors, nurses and solicitors.  There is a whole new world of people who have received a fine education but to whom we do not provide the second part of the equation — a job and a future.  The blame for this awful state of affairs rests squarely with Fianna Fáil and its buddies — the builders and the bankers.  Throughout the country people are outraged at the lack of action on the part of the Government and the corruption and the carry on in politics.  The culture of political corruption exposed at the tribunals is spreading like a cancer throughout all of our systems in business and commerce.  We have undermined our prospects for the future and those of future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The Government stands condemned.  It is planning more cuts and those who will suffer most are the old, the young and the most vulnerable.  The measure of any just society is the way it treats those who are most vulnerable at a time of need.  The Government stands indicted, not just here in the Dáil or the court of public opinion but in the hearts and minds of Irish people everywhere for what it has not done and for what it is failing to do.  It must go.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Government could have anticipated the very bad figures announced today but what does it intend to do?  It states it will think about what it will do.  There is no decisive action, no clarity or purpose or intention and no national plan.  There is no presence here either, which is a disgrace.  The people are extremely angry at what is happening here.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I refer to what is happening in my constituency of Louth.  Vibrant busy towns such as Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee are now ghost towns at weekends and on shopping nights because there are no shoppers.  Many of them do not have the money to shop, while a significant number travel north of the Border to get a better deal with the small amount of money available to them.  This is a message for the Tánaiste who puffs and pants about what she will do about retail outlets and saving jobs that are being haemorrhaged left, right and centre in the retail trade.  The likes of Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer are ripping off consumers who shop south of the Border through the differential between sterling and euro prices.  What is she doing about this?  The answer is absolutely nothing.  Suppliers to Tesco are being told that if they do not come up with various sums, in some cases in excess of €1 million, they will lose their contracts.  What is the Minister doing about this?  Again, the answer is absolutely nothing.  The Government is an abject and total failure.  It has shamefully disgraced itself by its absence.  I could go on but clear and decisive action must be taken, particularly in Border counties such as County Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Why do we not have a new deal for local government?  Why do we not have a rates moratorium for businesses which cannot pay rates, publicans who cannot pay their staff and shops which cannot meet their bank bills?  That is not happening because the Minister of State is not making it happen.  He is running away from the problem.  He is the only Government Member in the Chamber to listen to the debate.  The rest are cowards.  They are afraid to face the music but they will not get away with it forever.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">I was going to leave the Opposition until last.  According to Fianna Fáil, it is not its fault.  Its supporters were out on Saturday night.  Poor David Davin-Power was not able to give his report.  They were like the Mafia gathered around him, afraid he would say something wrong that would upset Fianna Fáil.  I listened to Fianna Fáil Ministers as they told us weekly — I am in the House a few years now — that Fianna Fáil had created the boom.  It created the boom but busted the country.  The Progressive Democrats were the moral conscience of the country.  Where is the party now?  It is no more, yet we have a Progressive Democrats Minister for Health and Children.  She should be gone, with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The people are looking for vision.  They want leadership and the country to survive.  They want to keep their jobs and help the economy, but what are they getting?  There is no leadership.  There is a budget every week or month.  The Government has lost its way and has no ideas.  I heard political commentators, some former Fine Gael members, say we needed a Government with experience.  The Government has been in place for 12 years and has lost the run of itself.  Ministers are flying around in helicopters while the country is going down the tubes.  A Minister was not able to drive from Dublin or Waterford to attend a conference in Killarney in a State car.  He had to have a helicopter bring him there.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Government does not realise what is happening in the country, but I have a message for the Minister of State.  The people are waiting in the long grass for an opportunity to vote on the Taoiseach because he was not elected by them but by Fianna Fáil.  We need an election to clear the Government out and bring in a new one, one with new thinking and ideas to try to give confidence to the people who are crying out for leadership and good government and want to play their play.  They believe the Government is not playing its part.  Those in government should listen to their constituents.  Fianna Fáil back benchers are not even attending public meetings or holding clinics.  They are afraid to meet the people because they know they are waiting for them.  The people are angry and afraid and want a new Government.  We all say we want an election because we need one now to clean out the Government and bring in a new one with new ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Fine Gael had to clean up the mess before and bring the country back from the brink.  We are ready and able and have Members on these benches who are well capable of being Ministers and leading the country out of the depression and recession and building it up again to be a good nation, not one destroyed by the builders and bankers.  Fianna Fáil has destroyed the country and the people will talk to it shortly.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_607">It is not easy to follow Deputy Ring.  However, I am glad to have an opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">What is extraordinary is that those in government seem to be the only ones who are surprised by the Exchequer figures announced today.  The Government has responded to them by saying it will have to change tack again in its management of the public finances.  It may, by the end of the month, have to introduce a new budget and cut backs.  What happened today was absolutely predictable.  People have been predicting it for four months.  The figures on which the Government has been working, in terms of where Ireland will be at the end of the year, are not realistic, as everybody has been telling it.  However, it continues to peddle the myth that somehow Ireland will come out of the mist and be okay.  It is as if we will wake up in the morning and there will be prosperity again in Ireland.  The truth is the Government has not only failed to lead in introducing policies but, more importantly, also failed to lead by communicating with the people and telling them the truth about the crisis created by its mismanagement and the series of other elements outside its control happening outside the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">What has the Government done in response?  It has avoided telling the people the truth and continually avoided making decisions until forced to do so.  When Fine Gael called for a public sector pay freeze last October because it knew it was the only responsible thing to say at the time, the idea was dismissed by the Government which stated Fine Gael was anti-public service.  Three or four months later, it had to bring forward measures which were far more extreme and introduce pay cuts.  When Fine Gael stated it would be necessary to recapitalise banks for them to survive, its proposal was dismissed by the Government and the banks as unnecessary, but what has happened since?  The Government has had to do this.  When Fine Gael stated it would be necessary to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, the Government dismissed it as being out of touch and stated it did not understand the figures at Anglo Irish Bank.  One need only look at what has happened since.  Last week and the week before Fine Gael called for a mini budget to introduce new revenue raising measures to try to make a positive impact on the growing deficit.  Again, itt was dismissed by people such as the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, who said the Government had everything under control.  The reality is that because of the way the Government has behaved and communicated, politics has broken the trust between itself and the people.  The people are crying out to be led and inspired, even if that means hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The people understand the situation.  They are not fools, even though they are treated as such by the Government.  If the situation is explained to them properly, they will understand the crisis Ireland is facing in terms of the Exchequer figures, job losses, the banking sector and the range of measures needed to tackle the crisis.  They will understand and accept that we need to respond in an appropriate manner, but what they will not accept is a Government which leaves the country limping along without leadership and which, month after month, introduces new measures in response to the latest crisis because that is what continues to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Last year the Government took in just over €40 billion in the tax take.  In the first two months of this year we are already €1.5 billion short of last year's figure.  If that is replicated in the next ten months of the year, we will be €9 billion short of last year's tax take.  Does the Minister of State know what that means?  It means we will be €23 or €24 billion short in terms of a deficit.  Instead of having to save €18 billion, it will have to save €23 or €24 billion.  That is what we are talking about and the gap which must be closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The Government must give leadership.  It might be surprised if it does because the Opposition parties are moving beyond simply bashing it.  It might even receive some support here if it makes some brave decisions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
          <p eId="para_613">I echo the comments of my colleagues.  It is disgraceful that only one lone ranger is on the Government benches.  It is appalling, given the economic crisis we face.  It is high time the Government told some truths about the economic freefall in which the country finds itself.  It is past time for recriminations, admonishments and blame and it is time for Government Members to leave behind the self-pity and self-exoneration that has become the mantra of this Administration in recent months.  Does any Government Member have the courage to explain to the people the scale of our problems?  I hope the Minister, who has joined us, does.  More important, does any Government Member have the vision, drive and determination to set out a path for recovery?  I fear the answer is negative on both counts.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The current meltdown being experienced by business and workers throughout the State and economic forecasts, which are frightening, need to be examined to put in context the current economic position.  Ireland is on the precipice of catastrophe and we now need, more than ever, strong political direction to lead us safely from the edge.  The facts, about which I hope the Minister will be aware, are stark.  The economy is set to shrink by at least 5% this year.  Even in the depths of recession in the 1980s, the economy shrank by only approximately 1.5% annually.  The scale and rate of decline is utterly startling.  The number unemployed will increase to at least 450,000 while some are predicting it will be higher by the end of this year, which is more than twice the number signing on when the Taoiseach took up office last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">In the face of such devastating conditions, one could reasonably expect that a government would step up to the mark and set out an economic recovery plan as a matter of urgency and priority.  One could at the very minimum expect a government to attempt to step up to the mark, irrespective of how incompetent and paralysed it might be.  However, in the case of our Government, we see nothing but denial, delusion and a short sighted fixation on tinkering with the public finances.  Deputy Coveney referred to the tinkering, which amounts to €2 billion, but this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The majority of the people are reasonable and intelligent and they are willing to do their bit for the economy.  If the Taoiseach had the courage and character to set out the scale of the challenges that lie ahead, the people would respond but, instead, we are faced with the hyperbole of a Government, which still insists on referring to "adjustments", "economic indicators" and other jargon that means nothing to ordinary families.  People want the truth in plain language.  Any Member who believes we can spend our way out of this recession is living in a fantasy land.  It is time to get real and the people want politicians and the Government to get real.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Taoiseach owes it to the people to be honest about the cuts that will have to be imposed and the tax increases that are on the table.  He should show some respect for them by announcing an emergency budget, for which Fine Gael has called, to introduce the cuts and tax increases, which inevitably will be required to bridge the huge gap between revenue and expenditure.  No one will appreciate the postponement by the Government, for political purposes, of this urgent task until after the  local and European elections.  On the contrary, with some straight talking, the people will accept the necessary measures as being in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">As this is largely a self-made mess on the part of the Government, hard working people will not endure massive cuts and tax increases unless they are integrated into a long-term strategy to get us out of the current economic mess.  That is what is lacking.  We have not been given a vision for the reintroduction of competition into the economy, the creation of new jobs and so on.  We are not seeing a long-term strategy and people are finding it difficult to buy into this, as is the Opposition.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_347">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_619">I take great pleasure in contributing to the debate on this difficult motion.  In recent months, we have witnessed the over 70s campaigning against the loss of their medical cards and public servants marching because they feel the pension levy is unfair and unjust.  These people recognise the public finances are in a mess and the banking sector, in which we all had great trust and confidence, has virtually gone to the wall.  There is no confidence in the Government.  There does not seem to be any leadership or unit and if the Government made hard decisions, there would be unity among all parties in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The Minister has seen nothing yet.  I know what is happening on the ground, as I have a business background.  Business people with overheads invested in property and shares to diversify because they were told it was the right thing to do at the time.  They became involved in various property schemes and so on and they indirectly funded the Government's appetite for additional revenue.  However, they now are under serious pressure.  The clients of most solicitors have nothing left in the tank.  They have used up all their resources and not alone will their businesses fold, their employees' jobs will not survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The banks are not foreclosing and the Government is talking up this, but unless something drastic is done in the next six months, the Minister has seen nothing yet.  Most solicitors are aware of the scale of what is happening and the banks are afraid to foreclose because that will further exacerbate a difficult situation.  We are on the precipice of an economic downturn, the back of which we may not see.  I have stated repeatedly in the past six months that the Government parties have not been honest with the people because they feel the people cannot handle the truth.  Before the last general election, we were told it was anti-patriotic to talk down the economy and that there would be a soft landing.  It is some soft landing.  The people want the truth and the Government must inform them how deep is the recession.  If it does so, they will be able to handle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The banks are not providing capital to businesses.  When a business owner seeks a loan, he or she is charged a fee of €1,000.  If the loan is not paid on time, the bank hikes up the interest rate.  What is the Government doing about this?  The Government parties say we have control of the banks but small business owners are being threatened and abused and their charges are being increased at a time they cannot afford it.  Big bankers and the golden circle gambled big and lost.  Many employers gambled as well because they were told it was the right thing to do.  Unlike the bankers and those in the golden circle, they will not walk away and leave it to the taxpayer to pick up the pieces.  They have always supported the country by paying their taxes and standing by the State.  However, they need the Government to stand by them in order that they will survive.  Most of their businesses will go to the wall within three months and most of their staff will not have a job and will have to join dole queues, unless something radical is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The debate is about the country's economic survival and not about polls or the political survival of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  The Government will have unity if it tells the people the truth for once.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_647">I am happy to put on the record the truth of our economic position.  The future economic viability of this country is at stake.  We are living in uncertain times and are faced with new economic realities.  The financial crisis sweeping the world is the worst experienced since 1929.  We are living in an economic blizzard that is not uniquely of our making.  The difference now is that the globalisation of markets in recent years has meant that the speed and severity of the downturn has been unprecedented.  In Ireland, our economy has been hit hard on three fronts by the downturn, namely, the rapid decline in the domestic construction industry, our exposure to the international deterioration as a consequence of our small open economy and the growing euro-sterling differential.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The end-February Exchequer returns published today show that tax revenues in the two months to the end of February are down 24% on the same period in 2008.  All of the tax heads are down on the same month in 2008, reflecting continuing weakness in the economy.  For the month of February alone, the decline was 31%.  On the basis of this emerging trend and without further action, a shortfall in taxes will now occur.  The February 2008 return included an amount of capital gains tax receipts that we did not anticipate would be repeated this February.  Notwithstanding this fact, there is a real deterioration in income tax and value added tax receipts.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">In addition, expenditure pressures are also emerging as a result of higher live register costs.  Unchecked, this means a general Government deficit of 9.5% of GDP will be breached this year.  The 9.5% limit on GDP must be fundamental in terms of our borrowing requirement for Government current and capital purposes this year.  It is a fundamental matter because it already counts as one of the highest levels of borrowing in the EU, paralleled only by the UK.  Within the euro zone, it is the highest level of borrowing.  While it is correct to say that a number of euro zone member states are drifting well beyond the 3% barrier, none has reached the 9.5% barrier.  For this reason, it is of fundamental importance that we stabilise our finances before reforming them progressively.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">At its meeting this morning, the Government discussed the emerging position and was strong in its resolve to take the decisions that are necessary to ensure the stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances, which are an essential prerequisite for the renewal of the economy.  We decided to announce the further necessary measures in this regard by the end of the month.  This will involve the introduction of additional taxation and expenditure measures in 2009 to address the continued deterioration in the public finances and to ensure that the general Government deficit this year does not worsen from the previously forecast 9.5% of GDP.  No option can or will be excluded at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">It is disappointing that commentary to date has fixated on whether our measures should be characterised as a budget, a mini-budget or a supplementary budget.  No option is being excluded, as that is what the country needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">In the coming weeks, the Government will consider all options necessary to restore the public finances to sustainability, focusing on the additional measures required for this and next year.  I am arranging for my Department to brief the principal Opposition spokespersons and the social partners on the latest position.  My officials will set out the scale of borrowing required and the income and spending projections likely over the next two years.  I would also like to extend an invitation to the Opposition to submit any proposals it might have to the Secretary General of my Department for costing by my officials.</p>

The first step of the framework was delivered on 3 February with the announcement of a series of measures to secure further savings of up to €2 billion on a full year basis.  This also will be implemented and that money also will be saved.  The Government greatly regrets it was unable to achieve the agreement of either the social partners or the Opposition parties to the pension levy but it must take the decisions it considers necessary in the best interest of us all.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">In the light of the end-February Exchequer returns, however, further action now is necessary.  Accordingly, the Government will consider what additional measures now are required to restore order and ensure that we stick to the agreed framework agreed by all earlier this year.  It already has stated that it must restore the current budget position to balance by 2013 in order that it is not borrowing to pay for day-to-day spending.  The Government remains vigilant and is committed to continuing to take the difficult decisions that are necessary to ensure the stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances.  It hopes it can obtain the support of the social partners and the parties opposite to deliver on this commitment.  However, it will not be deterred from doing its duty to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Several important ongoing processes will continue to inform our actions.  This is not a matter of outsourcing decision-making but of sharing, within the Department of Finance, the expertise of others in arriving at decisions that will be taken by the Government.  The special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes will report to me in the coming months and make proposals to the Government on additional options for expenditure controls.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">In addition, I expect the Commission on Taxation to have finished its deliberations by early autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I should also add that any future decisions that will be made will continue to be informed by the framework for sustainable economic renewal published in December, which provides a road map for meeting the short-term challenges and positioning the economy in order that Ireland can benefit when the international environment begins to improve.  We will achieve this by building on our strengths in innovation and research and development, by addressing the huge market for environmental and energy-related products, services and innovation, investing in critical infrastructure and supporting employment-intensive activity in the short term, as well as reforming government to ensure we have a more efficient and effective public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Government already has taken action in this regard through adjustments to the research and development tax credit to increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location for this activity, which were included in budget 2009.  It will continue to protect jobs and offer support to those losing theirs.  It will, to the greatest extent possible, continue to provide an ongoing stimulus to the economy through its capital investment in roads, public transport, schools and housing to support future development and to enhance Ireland's productive capacity at this time of great need.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">It is of vital importance to continue to take all steps necessary to get the banking system fully operating again.  Crucial to our recovery will be a fully functioning and well regulated financial system that enjoys confidence and credibility inside and outside of the country.  The essential measures the Government has taken most recently with the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland are targeted at underscoring the stability of the sector and restoring credit flows that are critical to the effective functioning and performance of the real economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">There is no doubt that the economy has been undermined by the actions of some of our bankers.  It has clearly damaged our international reputation with regard to standards of corporate governance.

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_719">The reformed structure is expected to deliver new high standards of banking and financial regulation and corporate governance.  It will help restore the reputation of our regulatory regime and rebuild confidence by creating a single oversight institution charged with the important functions of ensuring financial stability, reinforcing prudential supervision and pursuing regulatory integrity through the entire financial sector in Ireland.  This will involve a fundamental reform and I will seek to ensure that the best EU and international practice is applied to Ireland's regulatory system.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The Government wishes to send a strong signal that the types of practices followed in some of our institutions are unacceptable, that the regulatory lapses will not be repeated but that Ireland remains open for the continued development of a soundly based, well regulated and competently supervised financial services sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The key messages I wish to give to the Irish people who hold the Government to account and to those outside with whom we trade and offer investment opportunities, are first that the Government has taken action on the public finances and is scaling up that action in the face of continued pressure on these finances.  Second, public spending will continue to be brought under control, tax revenues will be increased and the commitment to bring the current budget to surplus by 2013 will be met.  Third, while Government borrowing will increase, it will remain at a manageable level, given the low base from which it is being increased.  The Government will be able to borrow as all the credit rating agencies recently have re-affirmed Ireland's AAA rating, the highest credit rating.  Fourth, sweeping reforms of our regulatory and supervisory structures are planned to restore domestic and international confidence in the Irish financial services sector.  Finally, the Government will continue to work with its partners in the euro zone, the European Union and the international community to communicate its firm intention to take the necessary measures to address the difficulties both in the public finances and in the regulatory system.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The restoration of the public finances to a stable and sustainable footing is one of the most daunting challenges to face any Government since the foundation of the State.  The Government will meet this challenge and I ask the parties opposite to set aside their political differences and support whatever Government action is for the good of the country and of its people.  We will adjust our cost base, improve our competitiveness, reorient our economy towards innovation and export-led growth in a fair and equitable manner and will ensure that this economy will once again provide employment, prosperity and opportunity for our people.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryWhite" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
          <p eId="para_782">In recent months we have all become far more conversant with the language of finance.  We have spoken about bear and bull markets, regulators, taxes, shares, dodgy banks and dodgy bankers.  Today, however, I intend to focus on taxation policy and the measures I would like to see implemented over the course of future budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">It was the view of my party when it entered government that the taxation code would have to be rebalanced so that higher earners would pay more and that the tax base must be made more sustainable.  It was for this reason that we insisted on the establishment of the Commission on Taxation, which is due to report in the middle of the year.  As outlined in the programme for Government, the commission was asked to examine four key areas.  These were as follows: the balance between taxes collected on income, capital and spending; tax expenditures with a view to recommending the discontinuation of unjustifiable tax expenditures; the future financing of local government; and the feasibility of fiscal measures to protect the environment, such as a carbon levy.  The latter is of particular concern given our escalating emissions.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, now may be the ideal time to introduce a carbon tax when fuel prices are low.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I have two specific proposals for Fine Gael.  The first is to revise toll charges.  Second, I have been speaking to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, about the possibility of introducing a tax on mobile telephone texting.  Given that there are 4 million people in the State and taking into account average texting frequency, a charge of 1 cent per text message would be a relatively painless way of yielding some €1.4 billion in one year.  Such a scheme would provide a means of spreading taxation in a fairer way.  I am pleased that some elements in the media have already picked up on this.  I hope it can be implemented in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">For the Green Party, our priorities in regard to rebalancing the tax system are based on the principle that those who have the greatest capacity should pay the most.  We are in favour of sustainable taxes on wealth and property.  There should be devolved financing of local government so that local authorities have funds at their disposal that will allow them to counteract the reckless overdevelopment of some towns and villages which took place in recent years, where development levies were collected at the expense of appropriate planning.  In that context, the current debate on the introduction of water charges, which seems to be led by noises from Europe, is an important debate in terms of how we might in future finance local government.  Citizens must become more conscious of their domestic consumption of water.  The water supply is of concern to everybody.  We have even had predictions that there may yet be a war fought on the basis of a struggle for access to water supply.  Water is precious and it is the responsibility of all of us to conserve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">While there is much rhetoric from the Opposition about the need for fairness in the tax base, it is important for us all to acknowledge the importance of spreading the tax burden.  The low-tax regime we have enjoyed in recent years is no longer sustainable.  Everybody will be obliged to pay more tax in return for the services the State provides.  The last several months have been ghastly, in this House and outside of it, as the financial turmoil unfolded.  With unemployment rising, I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has set aside €100 million for insulation grants.  As well as making people's homes warmer and reducing their fuel costs, this scheme will take plumbers, small builders and electricians off the dole queues.  This is one small step of which we are very proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Tough times require tough measures.  However, the Green Party will insist that any cutbacks are implemented fairly.  For a long time, we were a prudent people.  More recently, we became big spenders.  The Japanese have a wonderful word, <i> chindogu</i>, to describe this type of unrestrained spending.  Much of our new-found wealth was spent on unnecessary purchases.  I met a person recently who had built an enormous house with six bedrooms, all <i>en suite</i>, but who has now lost his job.  That type of behaviour was the consequence of reckless lending to people who hoped the good times would never stop rolling.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Despite the Opposition's hypocrisy, I am hopeful that the decision to guarantee bank deposits and recapitalise the banks was the correct one.  The bottom line is that people must have trust and confidence in the banking system.  I spoke to an elderly lady in my home town of Borris, County Carlow, who proclaimed how happy she was to insert her ATM card into the slot and find, after all, that the money comes out.  That security has been achieved.  I am hopeful too that small and medium-sized enterprises will be better able to conduct their business now that there is additional liquidity in the banking system.  It is important for all towns and villages that small retailers, and even larger stores, can keep going in tough times.  I am confident the State can regain its former high standing in international banking circles.  I commend the Government's amendment.</p>

That seems to be what he said but I am not entirely sure.  Many families who are watching television or having dinner together tonight are extremely worried about what the future holds for themselves and, in particular, for their younger members.  It is tremendously difficult for families, individuals and business people caught up in these catastrophic financial difficulties caused by the Government to deal with the situation that is unfolding.  The Government has been extraordinarily maladroit and cack-handed in dealing with the crisis.  Within a couple of weeks, some 20 Ministers and Ministers of State will depart for countries around the world for St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  The Government must have a message that this country is open for business and hopes to do business.

          <p eId="para_802">I refer to the families losing income and employment, as the Government announces another budget that will consist of increased taxes.  Deputy Mary White extolled the virtues of a carbon tax.  Does that mean that this measure will be brought forward?  The purpose of a carbon tax is to shift people from excessive consumption and carbon emissions and to recycle the revenue from tax into employment creation activities or reducing taxes on labour.  The Government must spell out the following issue.  Are we facing a carbon tax and what will it apply to?</p>
          <p eId="para_803">This Government introduced a process of regulation in respect of energy.  At the end of the process, with an expensively paid regulator, we have the dearest domestic electricity prices in Europe and, disastrously, some of the dearest prices for electricity to businesses and industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">For industrial, commercial and domestic consumers this model has been a disaster.  Members of Fianna Fáil in government know this and do not deny it.  Is a carbon tax one of the proposed new taxes?</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I made a request to the Taoiseach that all papers and information from the Commission on Taxation should be published now.  The Commission on Taxation was my proposal.  I argued for this over a long period of time and I was pleased that many other people in all parties took up the idea.  In the context of my proposal the Commission on Taxation was intended to identify with some clarity who pays tax, the rate of tax they pay and the tax breaks that have become an amazing feature of our tax system.  These allow very wealthy people to pay no tax and allow the phenomenon of tax exiles, who leave the country at one minute to midnight, live in Ireland and yet pay no tax.  The purpose of the Commission on Taxation is somewhat similar to the Law Reform Commission, to set out the facts so that political parties and whoever is in government can reach a conclusion in the broad public interest in terms of fairness and incentivising areas such as employment, business and job creation.  The challenge for the Government is to open up the papers of the Commission on Taxation.  The Government suggests that this might wait until June or September.  The country cannot wait that long.  If people talk about a bipartisan approach to taxation, this must be in the context of reliable information.  I have the tax figures from two years ago and three years ago.  The February tax returns, released today, are roughly the same as the February tax returns for 2004.  Having figures from last year or the year before is not of great relevance because many of the categories have collapsed.  If the Government wants to act in a bipartisan way, so that all parties contribute their views on what can be done, we need the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Throughout the banking crisis, I was astonished that the Department of Finance was behind the curve in respect of international banking and the consequences for banking in Ireland.  I was astonished that the Department of Finance and the regulator were hopeless in respect of what was taking place in our banks.  AIB acknowledged yesterday that six developers owe more than €500 million each to the bank.  Some 15 developers each owe more than €500 million to Anglo Irish Bank.  The capacity of the Department of Finance and consequently the Minister for Finance to have a grasp of what is going on is astonishing.  I heard from the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that we are blaming the bankers and clearly they deserve a large portion of blame.  People are completely disappointed that the regulator failed totally or else had a complete misunderstanding of what the role entailed.  If we are to move forward we need solid, reliable information.  It is not possible to make policy otherwise.  The principle of the policy must be that those who are wealthy and have availed of extraordinary tax breaks during the Celtic tiger years now have an obligation to give something back.  One cannot ask a clerical officer in the Civil Service, who must pay a contribution of 6% net of tax in respect of a pension levy, to pay more at the end of this month unless we first establish the principle that the tax adjustments begin with the very wealthy in our society.  As a country we must retain some fundamental notions of fairness.  Otherwise, it is not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I was amused when I heard the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, talking about bankers and Cromwell at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  Fianna Fáil is the republican party and in his native country Cromwell is revered as one of the great figures of English republicanism.  It was ironic that a tribute from an Irish republican to an English republican was the theme of the Ard-Fheis.  This bird will not fly unless the fundamental notions of fairness are addressed.  The Irish people are decent and people all over the country have braced themselves to make a contribution.  They will not make a contribution that is hard on individuals and families.  They are already paying a 1% income levy and those in the public service are paying an average 5% or 6% in a pension levy.  People have been asked to pay more while those at the very top swagger away and contribute nothing.  That is a republican conundrum.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">Those in the party are only republicans in very small writing.  I thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  Sinn Féin supports this Fine Gael Party motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Who does not know that we need a new budget as our public finances deteriorate daily?  Who does not understand that the absence of effective strategies for job creation, taxation and public finances actively make a difficult trading environment for business a dire one?  Who does not know that taking action now is vital and that each day lost is another body blow to a bruised economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_811">It seems that the only people who do not know are the coalition Cabinet and the docile backbenchers who will, upon command tomorrow, once more vote <i>en masse</i> to oppose this motion knowing that within it there is the undeniable truth that the Taoiseach has been sitting Nero-like for nearly a year now.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Do the 1,000 plus jobs lost each day in January not prove the depth of the crisis we face?  Unemployment figures for February will be announced this week and tell an even more dismal tale.  It is 155 days since the banking bail-out was announced at the end of last September.  Longer since is the calling of an early budget last year and it is longer still since the Government first went public last June about the deteriorating Exchequer finances.  I congratulate the Taoiseach today on his 300th day in office but I cannot congratulate him on his record over the last ten months.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Napoleon got within striking distance of Paris within a 100 days of leaving exile on Elba before he met his Waterloo.  It seems that our Taoiseach's nadir will have to wait until 5 June.  The Taoiseach had some Napoleon-like characteristics as he strutted, huffed and puffed, presenting himself as a person of purpose and of action.  The truth is very different and there the comparison ends.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Sinn Féin, like many others, has been seeking a solution to the current economic downturn and attempting to probe the jungle of Government finances and policies to find out just what is feasible and practical.  Our first conclusion must be that there is so much that the Government does not know.  When asked in parliamentary questions, the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, does not know how many former Deputies are drawing down pensions.  The Minister for Transport does not know how many miles of motorway have been built under public private partnerships, but we know that each mile was more expensive for the taxpayer.  Does the Minister for Transport know this?  No, but the Government persists in supporting PPP financing which is wasting taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The Minister for Finance cannot quantify the financial loss to the Exchequer of tax exiles who are non-residents.  Is he aware that in the last year for which the Revenue Commissioners have issued figures, there was a 13% increase in the number of people claiming to be non-residents?  Will he release the names of the 5,803 people who live here part of the year, work here, create wealth here for themselves but do not pay tax here?</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Did Bono send the Taoiseach a copy of the new album?  I am sure it came with a big "Thank you" from the boys in the band.  I hear one of the tracks is called "Moment of Surrender" and I would not be surprised if some of the bankers penned that one.  Perhaps the Minister has it on his iPod?  It is interesting that we can have new copyright laws and court cases to protect the rights of music artists from illegal downloads yet we cannot make people who live here pay tax.  We do not imprison tax fraudsters or deviant bankers who squander billions but we can catch the more traditional bank robbers within hours of a heist.  If only the Government was as active and effective as the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Let us not dwell on the negatives of the Government's abysmal record and focus instead on the positive steps to pull the economy out of this malaise created by this coalition Government.  Does the Minister for Finance know that an increase in the income levy to 6% on salaries of €200,000 and over would yield €130 million annually to the Exchequer?  I trust that he and all the other Ministers who enjoy salaries in this bracket would be more than willing to do their patriotic duty and pay such a levy.  Has he considered confining to the standard rate of income tax the deductions and reliefs which were allowable at the 41% rate, given that such a measure could, according to figures from his own Department, amount a sum in the order of €1 billion?  Will he also not consider abolishing the PRSI ceiling as such a measure would bring in €223 million in a full year?</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I fear the Minister and Cabinet are not considering any of these options.  Instead it is the equivalent of the route of one long ball tax strategy of taxing those who can least afford it, with the lowest disposable incomes.  Finance and taxation is only one plank of what the Government needs to be doing.  Where is the strategy on job creation?  Given that the Taoiseach is flying to Washington for St. Patrick's Day, has he been reading the US media to catch up?</p>
          <p eId="para_819">One column in a series in Sunday's <i>New York Times</i> on the recession was penned by Google CEO Eric Schmidt.  In it he wrote, “When looking at our economic decline, we can all agree on two things: we did not get here overnight and we will not recover tomorrow”.  Schmidt continues by stating there are steps that “need to be taken to speed up the process” such as “getting credit flowing again, taking action to create jobs, repairing our broken infrastructure and increased transparency to ensure we measure the effectiveness of the dollars we spend”.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Would the Taoiseach accept that none of these actions is being implemented in Ireland?  Perhaps it is worthwhile for the Taoiseach to travel to a White House reception as he might take on board some of these proposals.  Perhaps the Taoiseach read last Thursday's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I know he did not read Friday’s edition as we know he does not do “bad” news.  I was taken by the strap in one tabloid newspaper referring to the claim by EU Central Bank Chairman, Mr. Trichet, that the Taoiseach was “acting resolutely”.  The headline declared “Banker backs him, voters don’t”.  We  know why that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">In the business section of the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Thursday, an interview with Microsoft Ireland managing director Paul Rellis made interesting reading.  He spoke of building an innovation economy in Ireland and said:  “One of the most emotional challenges facing this county is the fear factor.  The country needs to focus on being ahead of the curve”.  He proposes that “Fibre-optic networks need to be deployed nationally to benefit schools and business but fundamentally, Ireland’s core advantage in the years ahead will be its people”.  Rellis proposes developing core clusters in the area of renewable energy and digital media and finishes by saying that there “are a lot of open ears in the public and private sector for building future industries”.  Those industries will need stimulation and Government initiatives, none of which has been evident yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">We must ask the Government if its eyes are open as up until now they have been closed to the reality of the challenges we face and the opportunities available to us.  In a British newspaper interview today, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling admits that Ministers there "must have the humility to admit that mistakes were made in the lead-up to the financial crisis".  When will some of that humility be evident from the Ministers here?</p>
          <p eId="para_823">It is worth recalling that in the run-up to the last election in 2007, my party was castigated for advocating what were at the time extremely modest tax increases.  Some very arrogantly described my party members as economic illiterates.  It is very evident now that all other parties in this House advocated tax decreases and had they any modicum of our understanding of the economic position, they would have known better and this State would be in a much better position economically than it currently is.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">A photo finish is still a win.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">When I spoke here recently on the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland and AIB, I stated that I did not believe the Minister's proposals would be sufficient to restore the lending position of the banks in order that they could again provide a credit flow, which is essential to restoring the health of the economy.  Now that the Minister is taking the necessary statutory power to give effect to his proposals, I am even stronger in my belief that his proposals are not fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">My belief is based on a number of factors.  First, the markets have rejected the proposal.  The value of shares in both AIB and Bank of Ireland have collapsed.  I checked the closing prices of those shares today before I came to the Chamber and AIB shares closed at 42 cent while Bank of Ireland shares closed at 19 cent.  One could buy five Bank of Ireland shares for €1 and still have change.  Those share prices do not reflect confidence in the recapitalisation proposals brought forward by the Minister.  This is the judgment of the investment community at home and abroad.  The Minister may agree and even argue that the reality is different, but in matters of investment perception is king.  The perception of the investment community is that the proposed recapitalisation of the banks is insufficient.  Therefore, it will not work and it is not fit for the purpose.  As I said, when we debated this proposal initially, the Minister will be back here before too long taking other measures, which he signalled today in terms of this Bill and which he is partially taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Second, my belief is reinforced by the fact that most analysts and bank commentators view the proposals as inadequate, that the figure of €7 billion will not be sufficient to recapitalise the Irish banks because the weakness of their loan books requires far more capital than that.  In the property and banking collapses in Switzerland and Sweden in the early 1990s, 8% of the banks' loan books was written off.  If the write off of these two banks is of a similar proportion, then the figures are completely inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Third, the European Central Bank advised that the best way to proceed for eurozone members who need to recapitalise their banks is to recapitalise them but to bring in proposals in parallel for a bad or toxic bank together with provisions for insurance against bad debts.  The Minister has not done that.  He has taken no action.  He has promised to consider these options, but while he waits confidence slips away.  The main problem with the Government is that its decisions are always behind the curve.  Matters are moving forward at a very rapid pace and the Government is chasing after events.  Consequently, it never turns the trend and inspires the confidence that is necessary to get things moving again.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">My fourth reason for believing the Minister's recapitalisation proposal is fatally flawed is that banks internationally, and in Ireland, will shortly have to move back to a more traditional type of banking.  In the boom years the Irish banks operated on a loan to deposit ratio of, in theory, 160%; the ratio probably went higher than that.  In simple terms, for every €100 they had on deposit, they loaned €160.  They borrowed on the wholesale money market to make up the €60 gap.  In the current process, known as deleveraging, the lending to deposit ratio will have to be reduced to between 80% and 100%.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_495">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_833">Yes, from the current 160%. The wholesale money market is effectively shut.  Even bankers do not believe bankers.  The banks will have to increase deposits and reduce lending.  They are currently not increasing deposits, therefore, they will have to reduce lending.  The recapitalisation programme, for structural reasons within the banks, will not provide the credit flows the economy currently needs.  I advise the Minister there is a danger that the banks will use the money provided by the NTMA pension fund to strengthen their own positions and to provide for their own jobs and, if they can, for their shareholders, whose interests are being wiped out, but they will not provide the credit lines the economy needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The Minister for Finance outlined the various agreements and protocols he has with the banks in return for the recapitalisation plan, but the inadequate credit lines available to businesses and consumers are not loosening up.  Nobody believes the banks.  Furthermore, nobody believes the Minister has the authority — given that he did not take it under legislative form — to instruct the banks to lend in a particular way.  Therefore, the commitments they have made do not amount to very much.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In the Government announcement of 11 February 2009 on the recapitalisation of the banks, the Government set out the terms of the agreement.  In the section headed "Bank Customers Package", there is a commitment to increase by 10% lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009.  The recapitalised banks have also agreed to work closely with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to ensure the supply of funds necessary to finance contractors engaged in major projects sponsored by these agencies have the credit facilities they need.  To date, nothing seems to be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I listened to the "Today with Pat Kenny" radio programme on my way to these Houses this morning and heard the chief executive of Aer Arann claim his company, which has a turnover of €100 million, could not get a €100 overdraft from the banks.  He said that in the aviation business there is a cash starved winter season and a cash rich summer season and that, therefore, airlines need credit lines to tide them over.  It is similar to a farmer buying cattle in the spring time and selling them in the autumn.  The same principle applies in the aviation business.  That chief executive of Aer Arann said on radio this morning that because he could not get €100 in credit from the banks this year he was, effectively, forced into having to let go 70 people.  He had 70 redundancies in the company, but if he had a credit line with the banks those redundancies would not have been necessary.  When pressed, he said the system would have to change, the banks would have to be nationalised and the Minister for Finance and the Government would have to instruct the banks to provide money in the first instance to stabilise jobs — which in the case of his company would not have been lost if he had access to credit — and to create jobs along the lines of the Minister's intent to fund IDA and Enterprise Ireland projects.  However, that is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I listened to the comments of Mr. McCaughey on "Questions &amp; Answers" last night.  He is a well known businessman from Northern Ireland and a man who would be well known to Fianna Fáil.  The Government appointed him chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  He was appointed to boards by the Government previously.  He is a respected businessman and I believe he is a good one.  He said there was little or no credit available to small and medium-sized businesses.  He said the banks are more of a problem than a solution and that they should be nationalised.  He said the Government should mandate the banks, when they are under State control, to provide money to the sectors of the economy that intend doing and want to do business and which are providing jobs and will continue to provide jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">We have heard anecdote after anecdote from Members of all sides about the experiences of their constituents in failing to get credit lines from the banks.  The announcement to recapitalise the banks was made prior to Christmas, the detailed announcements were made on 9 February and it is now 3 March, but nothing has happened to relieve credit lines.  This approach is not working.  The danger now is that the banks will not be revitalised — as they were in Sweden over a two and half year period in the early 1990s — and that they will become the zombie-type banks which mired Japan in recession for a decade right through the 1990s because it took a different set of options.  The Minister's set of options are more in line with those taken in Japan than what the Opposition is advocating, which is to follow what happened in Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The Bill is largely an enabling one.  It enables the Minister to do what he has already announced in using the National Pensions Reserve Fund to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland.  It also enables the Minister to do things he has not announced.  It enables him to direct the commission under the National Pensions Reserve Fund to take a controlling interest in either or both of the banks.  This is very interesting.  The Minister has said that he is only inserting the provisions on the basis that while he is making some changes, he might as well make a few more.  He has said that he never intends using these powers.  The powers he is taking would work as follows.  If AIB and Bank of Ireland require more capital and went to the market on a shares issue, they obviously would not get it at the moment.  If they approached their own shareholders at 42 cent and 19 cent a share, respectively, I do not believe they would get it either.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The Bill contains an enabling provision allowing the Minister to direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund to take the shares on any public offering made by a publicly-quoted bank, in other words AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Of course he claims he will never use these powers.  However, he went on to say that if the powers are ever used they will not be subject to reference to the Competition Authority as a financial merger because the Minister is taking to himself the powers of the Competition Authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">They will not be subject to EU law because the Minister is making provision that they be excluded from the provisions under EU law to treat them as mergers and reconstruction, and that they will just be a kind of management issue.  He has set it up so that without returning to the House, he may instruct the National Pensions Reserve Fund to take a majority shareholding in AIB and Bank of Ireland right up to taking a controlling interest or 100%.  More interestingly he has removed the commercial mandate requirement in the 2000 legislation so that it can invest even if it is not a commercially viable proposition.  There is a man who never intends using these provisions and yet he went down to that level of detail.  It is contained in the Bill and outlined in the Minister's speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">People are scared enough without scaring them further.  It is absolutely clear to me as to the road we are going down at the moment and it is not a very pleasant road.  If I were giving advice to the Minister I would ask him why he is always chasing the issue.  Why is he not upfront and admit this is not working?  We need to go further and do it now.  If the Minister got ahead of the game for once he would create confidence.  The public are waiting for confidence.  There is considerable talk about lack of leadership.  What is leadership anyway?  Leadership is taking the decisions that are necessary to be taken in a timely manner.  There is no point in taking the decisions that are necessary to be taken when it is too late and we have gone on to the next event.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">It is as clear as crystal that as we in the Opposition said the decision about a budget should have been taken a fortnight ago because it was clear that the public finances were going off the rails.  We found out today that the €37 billion that the Government had pencilled in as the inflow to the Exchequer will only be €34.5 billion, which puts us another €2.5 billion adrift.  The Taoiseach today announced that before the end of the month he would take measures to correct this.  Again he is behind the curve and behind the pace.  I know he gets offended when he is accused of lack of leadership.  However, it was as clear as crystal to all of us in the House and to the commentators since 1 February that it was not possible to carry the budgetary decision beyond the date of the local and European Parliament elections and the Government would be forced to act sooner.  However, by not acting sooner it will be subject to considerably more criticism.  In terms of inculcating confidence into the economy, a decision forced onto the Government at the end of March gets it no marks whereas a decision voluntarily taken to bring in a budget on the same day as the pension levy would be better politics because it would appear more equitable and would give some confidence to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">I found it a pretty depressing day.  I found the Minister's speech pretty depressing.  However, to give him his due he cheered me up in one page of his speech in which he tried to deal with the problem of the Green Party in government.  It is quite clear that in Cabinet the Green Party Ministers were very concerned about the banks, but they did not express that concern or make it conditional.  They were very concerned about lots of things but they did not make it conditional.  However, they were seriously concerned as to whether the investment made by the National Pensions Reserve Fund was ethical.  The Green Party has been on this bailiwick for a long time.  What is ethical on the left is not always ethical on the right.  On the question of contraceptive devices as the Minister of State will know, there is an extreme left opinion that they should be given out free with the cocoa and the Coke depending on what one's going to bed tonic is.  There is a view on the right that they should be banned because they are the devil's instruments.  It is very difficult for an investment company in examining the ethics of investment in a company that produces such devices to decide whether it is ethical.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">I actually like the Minister.  What he does, as explained in his speech, is to raise an issue which nobody raised in this context.  He said that given that we are legislating again for matters relating to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the issue of ethical investment comes up.  In his next paragraph he went on to say that it is a very serious issue because it was debated at the time and it was decided that it would be left to the fund managers to decide on an ethical basis for what they would invest in but that the Government would not mandate them to exclude any investments.  He then went on to say that in the experience of the past nine years with sovereign funds, they are taking a different attitude to ethical investment and that we need to take that into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">However, he claimed that what we are doing today is of such urgency and of such importance to the economy that we could not deal with the matter in today's Bill and he would set up a committee that will report in three months.  I am delighted that the Green Party had such a major input into this economic crisis that it got a committee on ethical investment that will report in three months.  I ask the Minister in his reply to give a commitment to debate that report in the House.  I would love to debate a report from an interdepartmental committee on ethical investment.  I would like to have it debated here in the House and I am looking for that commitment from the Minister.</p>

At least there was some bit of entertainment in the Minister's speech today even if it is only to illustrate how ineffective the Green Party is in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I hope this works.  I always say that to the Minister.  We are in very serious times.  The country is in an awful state — a frightful state.  I have never seen people more frightened.  I have been dealing with my constituency since 1974 and have never seen people more scared.  I have never seen people so genuinely upset or having such a lack of confidence in the future.  The situation needs to be pulled together and quickly.  I hope this legislation works.  However, when the Minister has included in the Bill an entire series of measures to enable him to take the next step, that in itself takes the confidence away from the step he is taking today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_500">
          <from>Deputy Paul Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I will start by referring to what Deputy Noonan has said about the Green Party.  He is quite correct.  Ethics can be different depending on what side of the ideological debate one is.  Sometimes on the one hand all life can be sacred, but the woman still has the right choose on the other.  These are ethical decisions that are not made lightly.  There are always shades of grey.  I would contend that Fine Gael is more on the anti-abortion side and the Labour Party would be more on the clichéd, pro-choice argument.  However, there are shades in the ethical investment issue.  One cannot accuse someone who is trying to protect the life of the unborn of not having ethics just as one cannot accuse someone who is trying to protect the rights of the mother of not having ethics.  Similarly, it is a little disingenuous to give out about the Greens for talking about ethical investment because there are huge investment opportunities here at home that are ethical, will create jobs for people and will sustain our families and communities, which is the most ethical thing one can do.  I would agree that just because one has money to invest does not mean one should invest it in weapons of mass destruction, exploitative international oil companies or multinationals who abuse workers and care nothing for human rights.  My colleagues, including Deputy Cuffe, who had a major impact in this regard, say we should be careful where this investment goes.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">This should not be dealt with lightly as if this is the only contribution the Greens have made because we have made many other contributions.  We have taken the tough decisions when it would have been a lot easier to pull out in a populist stunt and say "Hang on a second, we know it was Fianna Fáil which caused this mess", but we did not.  In my last contribution on a related issue in the House, I pointed out that because Fine Gael, Labour and the PDs were all dipping into the corporate donations pot, we are collectively responsible for the mess.  The responsible thing to do is to stay in government, get on with the job and take the tough decisions, even if it means losing one's seat at the end of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I do not want to criticise Deputy Michael Noonan too much because he has proven he is a man of principle.  Deputy Noonan stopped Fine Gael taking corporate donations when he was leader of the party.  Unfortunately, he got shafted by his party for doing it.  The 2002 election campaign might have produced some fantastic pie-splattering photographic moments but, to be honest, it is Fine Gael which still has egg on its face over corporate donations, not Deputy Noonan.  Does Deputy Noonan sleep soundly at night?  You bet he does, because he put the country first.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Similarly, another Fine Gael former leader, Mr. Alan Dukes, was the author of the Tallaght strategy.  He did not get his reward for the Tallaght strategy because he too was shafted by his party.  Does he sleep soundly at night?  You bet he does, because he put the country first.  He did the right thing too.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">What we see in more recent times is that people and party leaders are more inclined to choose collective self-interest over the national interest.  Outrage has been expressed at measures that would be implemented like a shot if Fine Gael and Labour were in government.  Half-hearted offers of co-operation have come belatedly, I will concede, but not without the jibes and always putting elections before the electorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Deputy Enda Kenny is a most likeable and capable man.  If he ever becomes Taoiseach — I repeat if — he would no doubt grow into the job and his years of Oireachtas experience, coupled with the gravitas of that job, would no doubt maximise his potential.  Does Deputy Kenny sleep soundly at night?  Devil a bit of it.  He dreams vivid dreams, and in those dreams he is already Taoiseach — "I'm Enda.  I'm the Taoiseach.  I'm the gaffer."  He snores like a lion but when he wakes up, the lion fades and disappears.  What pops out instead?  A mouse — a mouse that is afraid to do the right thing; afraid to put petty party politics aside; afraid to start afresh; afraid to say "No more to corporate donations and the culture that caused this mess".  Unfortunately, Deputy Kenny is afraid that if he does the right thing, he might end up like Alan Dukes or Deputy Michael Noonan.  History has been kind about Alan Dukes and it will also judge Deputy Noonan kindly.  Will it be kind to Deputy Enda Kenny?  We will have to wait and see.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Of course, it would be unfair to solely discuss the attributes of the Fine Gael Party in regard to this debate.  We know what the Bill is about, namely, putting some of the National Pensions Reserve Fund into recapitalising the banks, which is absolutely necessary.  We all know, hands on our hearts, that it might not be enough, a point which has not been disagreed with by the Minister for Finance.  However, we must make a start.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have given a solemn commitment that the €3.5 billion going to each of them is sufficient.  While AIB's latest results suggest it may not be, one puts in what is expected, knowing one might have to put in more.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Even allowing for the 20% or so that was caused by our own avarice, this is a global crisis.  Throughout the EU and the western world, if one looks at any country — even Canada is having its problems, although it has levels of corporate governance we should emulate — one will see governments investing in their banking systems left, right and centre.  We must do the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">When one asks Deputy Eamon Gilmore what he will do and what alternatives he will offer, one gets nothing.  He is the head of a party full of talent, just like Fine Gael.  One need only look at Deputy Joan Burton, who is a formidable contributor in Dáil debates and a formidable expert in her field and, similarly, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  I am very fond of the Labour Party.  I live a couple of doors from Deputy Joanna Tuffy and we get on like a house on fire.  Unfortunately, however, Labour is a party that has put populism and pragmatism before realism.  This is allied with a mind-blowing arrogance that hovers like a stale smell every time Deputy Gilmore opens his mouth.</p>

          <p eId="para_861">It does the country no justice whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Put simply, what Deputy Eamon Gilmore has done in the past six months has not been to peddle the politics of hope.  We have had too many Obama analogies in this House.  This is Ireland, a sovereign state.  President Barack Obama is an inspiration to us all but we have our own people to inspire and we must do it with homegrown talent.  If that homegrown talent lives up its abilities, we will do that.  However, we will not do it by peddling the politics of hope while really peddling the politics of hypocrisy.  We do not need to feed on the fear and cynicism that is out there.  We need to show leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I say this to an almost empty Chamber but I say it anyway — let us think bigger, let us think about how we recover, let us think about how we work together rather than constantly carping at one another.  It will be difficult.  One has to defend oneself when one is insulted, but if Deputy Gilmore is serious about his offer to work together with the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, he should not say he will work with Fianna Fáil but only if Deputy Cowen is ditched.  That shows a huge disrespect to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">I have issues with Fianna Fáil, as I do with other political parties, as this House well knows.  I am willing to take it on the chin when people slag off the Greens because that is what political discourse is about.  The Greens are no Messiah or saviour and sometimes we are up our own backsides as well — that is true.  I have often said and done things I should be ashamed of.  At the same time, if people were willing to acknowledge the human frailties of the great talents in this House, we might get more done.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Rather than the arrogant posturing whereby Labour is willing to throw solutions the way of Fianna Fáil if it ditches Deputy Cowen, it should say that as of today there will be a new strategy for 12 months and that it is willing to work co-operatively.  It should not seek to throw muck but to say to the people genuinely and honestly that these tough decisions have to be made, that it will try to get a consensus, work with the social partners and come up with the most equitable solution, but it is going to hurt — there is no other way for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">When the time comes for the election, whenever it happens, the people can say it was Fianna Fáil and the PDs who were in government for most of the term, so let us blame them.  The Greens will then say they are all a bunch of cute hoors who were taking corporate donations, and that is what encouraged the bankers and the developers.  That is fair enough at election time.  However, I guarantee the House this.  The Greens take their responsibilities seriously in terms of getting us out of this crisis.  We will not pull out simply to preserve our Dáil seats, and anyone hoping for an election on the back of some very positive polls could be waiting a long time.  If Deputies Kenny and Gilmore must wait for such a considerable period, perhaps until 2012, before they get the opportunity to govern, then why not share the collective responsibility?  Why not participate in a positive manner in governance without precondition?  Let us remember that the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, is not in a position to engage in petty squabbles concerning who has what input.  However, if the Fine Gael and Labour parties were genuine and agreed in the interests of the State to actively engage without precondition in a discourse and if they honestly and openly engaged with the electorate, with voters and with the ordinary people who are suffering, they would find the Taoiseach's door open.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">If the Opposition was willing to enter into a Government of national unity, it could be a reality.  The Green Party will discuss such a motion at its convention at the weekend and I believe it will be passed.  However, it will only be a reality if people put aside the squabbles and look to the vision.  Otherwise there will be five years of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party getting it in the neck, the Labour and Fine Gael parties continuing to ride high in the polls, the population disaffected and grumbling and the economy more of a basket case than ever because of the instability caused by the bickering.  That is not the solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">We must consider our legacy as legislators.  Anyone present, watching on the monitor or reading the speeches may reflect on their legacy in 20 years time.  The Tallaght strategy of Mr. Alan Dukes is now 22 years old.  He is fondly remembered as a man without any ego.  He is helping out Anglo Irish Bank as we speak.  He is not averse to throwing in some, possibly well deserved, criticisms at the speed of the Government response.  However, he has been judged kindly by history because he did the right thing.  We must do the right thing now.  That is why I urge people to work together in the spirit of tripartisanship.  I do not expect it will occur.  I expect that the Green Party will argue that we must implement policies for the next 20 years which will create jobs, preserve the planet and ensure our economic stability in 20 years time and if we lose our seats that is fine.  We can look back in 20 years time and reflect on the matter then.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Unfortunately, the Green Party is but a small party of the Government.  We must have a wider vision.  We require expertise from all areas.  We have a contribution to make and we are pleased to make it.  We will criticise where there is a need to criticise and we will take it in the face when necessary too.  The talents of the likes of Deputies Richard Bruton, Enda Kenny, Eamon Gilmore, Pat Rabbitte and Joan Burton are under-utilised at present.  The cliches come easily because that is all we are dealing with at present in this cynical House.  It is very easy to sit on the fence when there is electoral gain to be made from that.  We must face some home truths and realities.  We must put money into the banking sector whether or not we like it and we may have to invest more money in future.  We know what caused the problem globally and what contributed to the problem locally.  In that context we must deal with the situation piece by piece.  We must be careful not to allow the current €18 billion borrowings to spiral out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The situation has not been painted in terms stark enough.  The average person does not really understand the purpose of the International Monetary Fund.  It is not about giving a dig out to poor auld Ireland Inc.  That money is wrung out.  The fund will twist arms and squeeze the blood out.  It will come from the jobs here, especially from the public sector.  I spoke on the pension levy acknowledging why it is necessary, although I regret that it had to be applied.  I acknowledge that it should be tweaked, either now or in the forthcoming budget.  We must show leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I return to this point because it is important.  I may sound like a broken record, but if the people are to have trust in the collective elite, there is a need for Dáil reform, cutbacks in expenses and proper vouched systems.  I do not believe I am elite but Members are perceived to be elite and to receive a great deal of money, perks and benefits.  In some cases we do and this has all been said before.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Last night, I attended a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran who is a very honourable politician who succeeded despite the culture of corruption in his constituency.  To my knowledge, he has never taken a corporate donation and is the epitome of the modern Fianna Fáil politician.  I wish the culture of that party was more akin to the personality of the Minister of State, Deputy Curran.  I say as much as a friend and without patronisation, because our friendship extends back to the council in 1999.  Preceding that council, in the areas where I grew up, namely, Lucan, Palmerstown and later in Clondalkin, Newcastle, Saggart and Rathcoole, there was a culture whereby donations were handed out to politicians of all parties and willingly taken.  In some cases such donations were corruptly taken as the tribunals have shown.  Unfortunately, the mentality in respect of corporate donations still seems to be "a head in the sand" approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I raised the issue of the necessity to ban corporate donations, or at least the need to refuse to accept them within the Labour Party.  Perhaps it does not receive a great deal from the banks and developers, although there are some instances of that, but certain trade unions are its paymasters.  Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil consistently take money from corporate vested interests, including bankers and developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">During the debate last night, it was no surprise when Senator Frances Fitzgerald contradicted a point I made concerning the need to ban corporate donations.  One need only consider her election campaign.  She spent €31,000 trying, unsuccessfully, to get a seat in Dublin Mid-West, whereas I spent approximately €10,000.  I do not suggest she was remiss, but she had a wider fund available from which to pay for her campaign.  When discussing the issue of corporate donations, she spoke directly to the audience with hand on heart and asked if they would rather that the taxpayer funded political parties.  Many of those in the audience, which met to discuss education issues, seemed to agree, because the argument was simple.  The argument was if politicians do not take corporate donations, the taxpayer must foot the bill and people have paid politicians enough already.  That was the mentality.  I wish to respond to the comments of Senator Fitzgerald.  In reality, the taxpayer has paid for those corporations ten times over.  Through corporate donations there was a process of land speculation, rezoning and corruption.  This fed into the culture which encouraged bankers and developers to become so greedy and to leave us in the mess in which we find ourselves.  The taxpayer paid a good deal more than otherwise would have been the case if corporate donations had been banned.  That is why I fundamentally disagree with Senator Fitzgerald.  I call on all Members of the House to try to work more cooperatively.  It is still possible to get the dig in but we must sell a common message to the people, that is, we are in this together.  We should blame those responsible later on, but for now we need to recover.  Let us think bigger.</p>

        <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_503">
          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
          <p eId="para_875">I am somewhat bemused by Deputy Gogarty's contribution.  From listening to him one could be left with the impression that the problems facing the economy and the banking sector are somehow related to the performance of the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  I am unsure how the Deputy has managed to draw those conclusions, but each to his or her own.  The Deputy is entitled to his opinions.  As Deputy Noonan has stated I genuinely hope the recapitalisation scheme set out in the Bill can work.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">We are all aware of the significant economic challenges facing the country.  In my contribution on the Private Members' motion I referred to the contraction in the economy expected this year which will be an unprecedented 5% plus.  The unemployment figures for January alone show 36,500 additional people signing onto the live register.  We are all acutely aware of the challenges faced by small and medium-sized business in particular.  Companies are closing their doors on a daily basis with people losing their jobs and all the ensuing problems faced by families up and down the country.  I hope this scheme can in some way contribute to a resolution of some of the problems in the banking sector and, by extension, in the wider economy as the two are inextricably linked.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">Like my party and our finance spokesman, Deputy Bruton, I too have major reservations about the scheme.  The recapitalisation scheme for Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks as set out in the Bill lacks credibility to a certain degree because it has already been proven to be inadequate in other jurisdictions over the course of the past few months.  One obvious failing is the very clear need which has emerged in other countries to separate bad debt from good.  This is evidenced in the response of the international system, yet the Government has chosen to ignore this by failing to introduce any element which would separate good and bad debt.  This is unfortunate.  The US has a scheme to create bad banks and the UK and other European countries have taken a similar route because their original recapitalisation schemes failed.  The European Central Bank also set out certain guidelines to governments on how to deal with this crisis and issued recommendations on the establishment of bad banks or their separation from the existing banking system.  I find it remarkable that the Government has not followed any type of procedure along those lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The Government has adopted a much more tentative approach and arguably one that has been unsuccessful in other areas.  It proposes to recapitalise by increasing the core tier 1 capital for each bank and in my view this is in the vain hope that this will provide the necessary protection against the bad debts within the banks.  My fear is that taxpayers will be left dangerously exposed to these massive bad debts and overdraft and borrowing facilities will be contaminated by them.  This is a concern expressed by a number of Opposition Deputies over the course of the past few weeks since the scheme was announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The Government should consider other options and I refer specifically to the creation of new good banks with clean balance sheets.  The Minister of State may recall in the past month Deputy Bruton proposed an alternative scheme which makes quite a lot of sense, particularly in light of what has happened in other countries.  I have concerns that the taxpayer is being asked to put money into banks without knowing the full scale of the bad or toxic debts and about which all of us are in the dark to some extent.  I am disappointed with the Government's failure to demand full transparency and full disclosure of facts by the banks.  There is a real risk the result will be to allow existing banks cover up the extent of their dodgy, very questionable property lending while continuing to starve viable, honest to goodness, genuine businesses of access to the credit which they so desperately need.  New lending to small and medium-size businesses is badly needed now.  This is the sector which has suffered most in recent times as a result of the bad banking practices of the past decade and more.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The Government is making a mistake in failing to look at the different model which has been proposed and which would create good banks with clean balance sheets and to which the recapitalisation would be directed and separate from the toxic debt which currently exists in the banks.  This would mean creating a new bank from which existing banks would hold all the State guaranteed deposits and would then buy those parts of the loan books such as the residential mortgage and business loans and overdrafts which could be easily valued by the parent bank, either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks.  This could constitute the new bank with the clean balance sheet.  This is a fairly simple and understandable proposal even to those of us who are not experts in banking——</p>

I understand the Minister of State's point but we have to be mindful of the fact that we are not immune and are exposed to the international problems and we also have our own home-grown problems in the banking system.  We need to think outside the box and not make the same mistakes which have been made in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The legacy bank which Deputy Bruton spoke about would be prevented from engaging in any form of lending in the traditional sense and it would be there essentially to manage the remainder of the loan book and try to recoup the maximum value even though we all know that the capital value has been reduced significantly over the past six or 12 months or longer.  It would be separated from the recapitalised banks which would be in a position to provide some form of cash flow to businesses and so open up opportunities to keep businesses alive, open and maintaining employment which is what many of us wish.  It would also make it easier for first-time buyers and young couples to obtain mortgages and get onto the property ladder.  The credit flow would be freed up.  This is one solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I listened to Deputy Gogarty and I have heard the Minister for Finance and every other Minister and Government backbencher calling on the Opposition to show patriotism and to co-operate with the Government.  However it is unfortunate that when we put forward solutions they are pooh-poohed and we are told they will do it their way, as the Taoiseach famously told us a few weeks' ago on the Order of Business.  There needs to be a willingness on the Government benches to co-operate with the Opposition because we are genuinely making some proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">On other aspects of the scheme, I have a concern about the preference shares proposal which is of questionable benefit.  This is another aspect of the scheme which has thrown up problems, particularly last autumn in the United Kingdom where a similar system was introduced and, to be blunt, it failed.  The dividend of 8% proposed under the scheme, although less than the 12% proposed in Britain, could well prove to be penalising for banks.  The estimate is that it could amount to about €300 million a year for each of the banks, or approximately €600 million, which would eat into their profits.  There is major concern that this would limit their ability to free moneys for lending to businesses and inhibit the required credit flow.  It is something that could reduce bank lending because of the restrictions being placed on them in having to pay the dividend to the State.  I am not 100% convinced that this aspect has been well thought out since we have seen it fail already in the United Kingdom.  We are in a climate where businesses are closing daily because of their inability to borrow from banks and I am not certain that this proposal will help in that regard, notwithstanding the commitment to lend to a figure of 10% lending to SMEs, as set out in the scheme.  I am not certain how this will add up and believe it might prove to be very difficult.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, we have seen little evidence of credit being freed in recent weeks.  In fact, the credit flow from banks is tightening on a weekly basis, as Deputies will be very much aware at constituency level.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I have other concerns, too, in relation to the legislation which is scant in detail.  We do not know to what extent the Minister will be restricted in how much ultimately will be paid out.  We are told the figure is €7 billion, but there is nothing to suggest it cannot increase.  I am not certain what the State will get in return.  We have an 8% dividend figure but do not know whether this will work out in practice.  I am not sure the Minister knows either.  We do not know what caps will be imposed on bank executives' pay.  We are not sure what the assurances are as regards credit availability and, in general, I am concerned about the terms and conditions for the banking sector as regards the return for the State and the concessions to be made or demanded.  There is nothing in the scheme in terms of detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">We know the State is proposing to invest €3.5 billion in Bank of Ireland and €3.5 billion in AIB.  There will be an option to buy ordinary shares at a later stage.  It is inadequate that there is only a 25% share of directors on the boards of the banks.  Also inadequate is the 25% share of voting rights as regards control of the banks.  My view and that of the general public is that there should have been a total clear-out of executives within the banks.  I do not know whether the Government's response has been tough or hard enough or whether the Government is demanding sufficient say in how the banks will be reformed and restructured in response to the current crisis.  Neither do I have a sense that it is demanding accountability from the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">While the Government assures us that these capital investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland will be considered by the Financial Regulator to be tier 1 capital investments, the crux of the issue is what matters in the international marketplace.  Do we have any assurances that international markets will see these investments as additions to the banks' core capital?  We have seen no response from the international markets in recent weeks, notwithstanding the announcement of the scheme, as set out by the Minister.  There are certain question marks in that regard also.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">A particular problem I have with the Bill relates to the continuing cosy arrangements for executives.  I point to the article we read in the Sunday newspapers which is of particular significance to me in my constituency.  I am concerned about the appointment of the new chief executive of Bank of Ireland who clearly has very close links with significant players in the property sector which have very direct links with Fianna Fáil.  I am perturbed about the continuation of this cosy cartel of bankers, builders and Fianna Fáil personalities.  The decision making process that led to this appointment was extraordinary.  This shows there is still a lack of realisation within the Fianna Fáil-led Government that such cosy relationships are no longer acceptable.  The people are fed up and tired of them and want to see fresh faces and new personalities not connected to this cosy circle of Fianna Fáil buddies in the building and banking sectors.  Unfortunately, we have not seen a clear intention from the Minister or the Government in ensuring such a shift occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Section 8 of the Bill gives enormous powers to the Minister to essentially do what he wants.  Deputy Noonan alluded to this issue also.  The Minister is being enabled to take a controlling interest in the banks and nationalise them without recourse to Dáil Éireann which I find extraordinary.  He would generate much more confidence among the public if he were to make it clear that this option was being left open to him in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">I shall conclude by saying we are in challenging times and need to get this right.  While I have concerns about the Bill, I genuinely hope it will set the banking system and the economy on the right track.  We all know people who are losing their  jobs and facing financial crises in their personal lives.  It behoves all of us as elected public representatives to work together in so far as we can to try to get the economy back on the road to recovery.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_897">I propose to take ten minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The Bill is being presented to us against a backdrop of an announcement today that AIB is to write off €1.8 billion in bad loans for 2008.  The Minister is asking the House to support a Bill that will recapitalise that same bank to the tune of €3.5 billion.  That is laudable but only if it results in provision of credit lines to businesses and borrowers in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The Labour Party must critically assess the proposals brought before us in the Bill.  As I understand it, €4 billion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund's current resources will be used as part of that recapitalisation, out of the total of €7 billion.  Bearing in mind that the global markets are not touching Irish stocks currently, I wonder whether that is a wise move and whether the methodology the Minister proposes in the Bill is not without its flaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">We are told by the Minister that he has consulted widely with financial and property experts in drafting this Bill.  I would like to know who were those financial and property experts.  I become a little afraid when I hear of Ministers taking the advice of property experts given the culture we have been used to in recent years.  I would like to know the nature of that advice and whether there was an alternative advice to that on which he has based his Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">For example, what was the alternative advice, if any, on devolving more power to the Minister with regard to directing the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission "to make investments in such institutions and to underwrite their share issues"?  Such a concentration of power must be questioned and the Minister must tell us whether there is scope for this power to be abused.  It is a theoretical question but in terms of the enactment of a law it is worthy of answer by the Minister in his reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">For instance, if the Minister determines, for political expediency, that an investment should be made in a specific financial institution, and if the NPRF determines that this is contrary to any responsible investment policy, it is powerless to act against such a move.  My understanding is that the responsible investment policy is one of the key components underpinning the governance of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Furthermore, investing such powers in the Minister bypasses this House and any scrutiny we may wish to pursue in this regard.  I would like the Minister to address that point when replying to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">In his contribution the Minister told us that the State will get a direct return for its investment.  In the current climate, and in the context of AIB's write-down of €1.8 billion today, it is difficult to envisage any return to the taxpayer any time soon.  I understand that if we take the long-term view an alternative view could be argued but the fundamental principle underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund is the responsible investment policy.  That is a stated policy that gives rise to the need to meet the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the years 2025 to 2055.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">On the face of it, the Bill should, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, yield a return to the Exchequer over a long-term period if a number of assumptions are taken.  If we assume there is no restructuring of the banking regime in this country within that period of time, that is, that no banks will merge or there will be no rationalisation or consolidation of banking, then it is reasonable to assume that the taxpayer will see a return on his or her investment but I question the Minister’s strategy in that regard.  That we invest with the possibility of a return is fair enough but the manner in which the Minister has pitched the proposed return on the investment speaks to me of an ill-thought out strategy that allows the banks to dictate the terms by which they will be recapitalised and not the people, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, whose moneys will be used for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">The Minister proposes to get a preference share with a fixed dividend of 8% or ordinary shares in lieu.  I would like the Minister to explain the reason he is proposing to take preference shares in the first instance instead of ordinary shares.  If the Minister is buying preference shares with a fixed dividend at today's prices, what will be the total yield to the National Pensions Reserve Fund if those shares are bought back by the bank within the five year period?  I understand they have a provision to do so or they are allowed to do so.  It seems to me that the Minister has allowed the banks a provision to buy back shares within the five year period at today's prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I question the validity of such a strategy and wonder if it would have been more expedient for the taxpayers' money, through the NPRF, to be used to buy ordinary shares.  That would have been a more responsible strategy.  If the two banks report losses within the next five years, what will be the status of the 8% yield on those preferences?  Also, what will happen to the yield?  If there is a return of 8%, where will that yield be invested?  Will it be awarded to the NPRF?</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I would also like to know what the Minister means, in layman's terms, when he states that he will allow the commission to set up a special purpose investment vehicle.  Notwithstanding that I have a degree in economics, I admit with a degree of humility that I do not have a clue what a special purpose investment vehicle is.  When we are writing legislation in this House, and if we are using taxpayers' money to underpin a strategy of recapitalisation, we must have it set out to us in clear terms what exactly that means.  If the Minister is to be given devolved powers and if we are setting up special purpose investment vehicles, we must know for exactly what purpose they are designed and, if there is a return on such a vehicle, the nature of that return and how those investments will be pitched.  Will they be for philanthropic purposes?  Will they be a sop to our learned friends in the Green Party?  Will there be a sustainable element to those vehicles?  What will be the nature of those vehicles?  The people are entitled to know that and it must be set out clearly in any legislation that is brought before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I wish to address some points made by Deputy Gogarty.  I do not mean to be personal in my response to his contribution earlier but I wish to state for the record that I have never taken a bribe or a red cent from any corporate entity, except through a fund-raising race event I held whereby local companies bought in to a race night I ran when I was raising funds to try to get elected to this House.  There is a desire by Deputy Gogarty to impugn certain Members of this House and develop a language that states that we are not credible to critically analyse any measure that comes forth from this Government in respect of any tract of legislation because somehow our respective parties in opposition are dirtied by the fact that they may have taken corporate donations.  I wish to state for the record that I have never taken corporate donations in that sense of the word.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_512">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_909">I wish to begin by expressing my opposition and the opposition of my party to this legislation.  I appreciate it is largely a technical Bill but it is what it enables that causes me concern.  We have opposed the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland because the Government is effectively handing over to the banks €7 billion worth of taxpayers' money without seeing sufficient material return to the taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">In the past six weeks the Government has taken thousands of euro from the budgets of low and middle income families through the pension levy.  It has cut back on special needs education and is in the process of imposing the most damaging of health care cutbacks the country has experienced since the 1980s.  All of that is being done for the benefit of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The legislation before us effectively proposes to give the Minister for Finance <i>carte blanche</i> to raid the pension fund whenever and however he wants provided it is for his pals in the banking sector and he decides it will rectify a serious economic disturbance.  Given the Minister’s abysmal failure to deal with the banking crisis so far, I am dreading the notion that he will be given such significant discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">At the time of the budget last October my party proposed the use of the pension fund for critical infrastructure so we could fight the recession and preserve jobs.  Despite the obvious need for investment in job creation and job retention the Government is continuing its exclusive focus on the banks while cutting back on essential public services.  There is nothing in this Bill which enables the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for labour-intensive transport infrastructure, there is nothing for the building of new schools or school extensions and nothing for other public services which would have a far more positive impact on the economy than what is currently being done with our financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">What is this legislation all about?  It is about using the pension fund for the Government's only real concern, which is the banking sector.  The public, the media and most economists are now sick and tired of listening to the Government waffle on about the critical importance of the banks when it has not even bothered to implement changes of any real significance to their governance or to financial regulation.  It has only put bonuses on pause for 12 months, taken out a token 25% stake and done nothing to address the credit crisis which is continuing to destroy our small and medium enterprise sector.  It is this lack of action on the banks coupled with the Government's quite brutal cutbacks on the public service workers, especially children in special needs education, which is causing much anger.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">A number of weeks ago an article by John McManus in <i>The Irish Times</i> mentioned the notion of group-think which seems to be endemic among senior management in our financial and State institutions.  He pointed out that PricewaterhouseCoopers is the auditor of Bank of Ireland while at the same time being employed by the Financial Regulator to carry out an assessment of its loan books.  He went on to describe this conflict of interest when he said actors were ultimately the judge of their own case.  This is bad practice.  This conflict of interest is exactly what is wrong with the Government.  It is because of the corrupt relationship between dodgy developers, the bankers and other special interest groups that the Government is now a prisoner of its own alliances.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I remind the Minister he unwisely boasted at the time of the bank guarantee scheme that this "was the cheapest bailout in the world".  This guarantee has left us with a potentially crippling debt of €440 billion.  With the recapitalisation of the banks we are now on the verge of using our last stash of money to pay for their mistakes.  It is the banks that should pay and not the workers in our SMEs.  We will therefore oppose this legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_513">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_916">This has been described as a technical Bill.  In one sense it is but it also provides for what is potentially one of the most momentous decisions that will ever be taken by the Oireachtas in our time.  The Government is to commit the people's money, in the form of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Sinn Féin has argued repeatedly for productive investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund in projects that will develop infrastructure and sustain employment in our country.  We argued against the gambling of the fund on the international stock markets.  In the boom times we argued for sound investment in sustainable development.  We were not alone in that argument but it was ignored by a succession of Ministers for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">What have we now?  The greed of the banks and their wealthiest clients, their indulgence by successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments and the neglect of the so-called regulators have brought the financial sector in this State to its knees with appalling consequences for the wider economy and society.  To prop up the two main banks, the Government is raiding the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is like a family having to hand over its savings to pay off the gambling debts of the landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">It is important to recall that in 2004 there was a series of scandals involving AIB.  It is easy to forget in the current circumstances but it is instructive to recall some of them.  The revelations at that time came not as a result of investigations by the Central Bank or by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority but from whistle-blowing within AIB itself.  Foreign exchange customers were overcharged from 1994 and it was shown that this was known at the highest level in the bank from 2002.  From 2000, between 500 and 600 mortgage holders paid up to €50 extra per month for mortgage insurance without their approval in a rip-off of customers by AIB.  To top it all we had the admission that senior AIB executives were evading tax through special offshore accounts, including Faldor registered in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">No one was surprised at any of this because scandal and AIB had become synonymous for years.  Let us not forget the backdrop to all this.  One scandal in particular should have been a warning then and should be a warning now.  Who now remembers how AIB was bailed out by the Fine Gael and Labour Government in 1984 after the collapse of the privatised Insurance Corporation of Ireland which AIB had bought and which failed on the international market?  The State bailed out AIB to the tune of many millions and got absolutely nothing in return.  From 1986 AIB was centrally involved in the DIRT scandal which deprived the public purse of significant amounts of revenue at a time when health and education cuts were being imposed on our people.  The Committee of Public Accounts found most of the senior management team in AIB were well aware of the existence of bogus non-resident accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">I stated in this House in 2004 that we must avoid a situation where only the financial institution was held responsible, with fines and penalties inevitably being passed on to customers.  I said the individuals concerned in AIB were some of the most highly paid individuals in the economy and worked for a company which had made record profits.  I said they must be held accountable but they were not and now we see the results.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">AIB made a profit of €1.375 billion in 2002, which was the highest ever recorded profit for an Irish company up to that time.  Under the policy of Fianna Fáil, AIB, Bank of Ireland and other financial institutions benefited significantly from the Government's cut in corporation tax from 16% to 12.5%.  The drug of escalating profits for shareholders and escalating pay for executives fuelled the reckless lending, which in turn inflated the property bubble.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">All of this was based on irresponsible borrowing by the banks and locked the Irish financial system into a cycle which could only, as we have previously highlighted in this Chamber, end in disaster.  It was not the case that no one shouted "Stop".  Sinn Féin shouted "Stop" but the problem was the Government refused to listen.  The people are now paying the price for rampant greed and irresponsibility.  They are paying it in public service cutbacks, new levies and taxes on the low paid and growing mass unemployment, and there is more to come as the Government well knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">There are two figures which sum it all up.  AIB and Bank of Ireland were bailed out to the tune of €7 billion.  There were €7 million in so-called savings achieved by abolishing classes for children with special needs.  The contrast is stark and tells its own story.  There can only be shame on this Government in its approach to dealing with this crisis.  I reject this Bill for the very sound reasons I have already explained.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_924">One of the main features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 was to ensure the National Pensions Reserve Fund could not be used by the then Government or future governments for any other purpose besides the meeting of pension costs, with a built in statutory prohibition on drawdowns prior to 2025.  A measure barring governments from using the pretext of "exceptional circumstance" to raid the piggy bank of the NPRF was welcome.  However, the ease with which the Government was able to utilise such funding for the recapitalisation of the State's two largest banks and overturn this provision of the Act was staggering.  That it is now seeking retrospective authorisation through this Bill is equally hard to equate with the aforementioned provision.  In addition, the legislation gives the Minister the power to invest unspecified amounts in any further bank or banks as he sees fit, which is an outrageous and disgraceful carry on by a corrupt Fianna Fáil Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_926">I am not contradicting my argument.  This is typical waffle uttered by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  The Minister of State is not tuned into the legislation.  The Government's actions <i>vis-á-vi</i>s the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks were a huge blow to public sector workers, with the ensuing pension levy controversy set to run and run.  It is incomprehensible to low and middle income workers that their money is disappearing into a bottomless pit.  Deputy Noonan highlighted that the shares of both banks have almost hit rock bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The National Pensions Reserve Fund was set up in 2001 using the hard earned money of taxpayers as a rainy day fund for a projected increase in the age profile of the country.  The fund was worth €16.4 billion at the end of December 2008 but there were signs it was worth less than all the contributions of taxpayers since its inception eight years ago.  Given the fall in world stock markets, the value of the fund, less the raided €4 billion, stands at only €11.9 billion.  In a move calculated to cloud the issue, as the Government parties always try to do, they appear to expect that by funding the banks through the fund, the investment will not be considered to be spending under the EU accounting rules.  It will technically, therefore, not break the rules by adding to the county's debt burden.  However, such a move will not go far enough to restore confidence in the economy abroad and will add to the burden of those least able to pay among our public sector workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">How does the Minister think that a low income civil servant, forced to hand over €450 of his or her meagre €15,000 salary, felt this morning when he or she read that Allied Irish Banks, which was bailed out to the tune of €3.5 billion, recorded its first loss in Ireland since the group was set up in 1966?  Shockingly, the bank made an operating loss of €121 million after writing off €1.3 billion in losses on loans, 81% of which related to property and construction.  Shades of cronyism and tents rise before one's eyes when the words "property" and "construction" are mentioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">The joy of the first step on the property ladder has turned sour for many young people and it has been replaced by the real prospect of being turned out of their homes.  This is happening, despite what the Government has stated, because too many restrictions are in place.  Shame on the Government for the way it is behaving towards the public.  This is far from the promises Fianna Fáil made in the run up to the last general election.  It will get its answer on 5 June, if not before.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Allied Irish Banks stated earlier it may write off up to €4 billion on bad loans in 2009 and €2.65 billion in 2010.  Not only is today's news disturbing for the taxpayer, it is also a major blow to international investment.  The chief executive of Allied Irish Banks described his efforts to explain the situation to international investors as a "very trying task".  Given his salary and the perks he has enjoyed, I do not shed tears for him.  His own avowed regret over aspects of the bank's lending record, particularly on loans provided to developers and builders, ring hollow in the light of the monumental blow that his actions and that of his bank have struck against the taxpayer.  A number of commentators claim the problems the banks are facing are compounded, rather than eased, by the Government's blanket guarantee of their debts and deposits.  Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland are no longer judged individually, as they have been subsumed into Ireland Inc, and are judged as one with the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The Government's total loss of credibility on the markets due to its failure to develop a comprehensive recovery package is damaging the banks it sought to protect.  For their economic recovery, they need to convince international markets to lend to them.  However, stories are rife about the current aversion to all things Irish among international investors and financiers.  While some may be attributable to a natural caution in the current global climate, the rapid fall from its elevated position leaves Ireland open to suspicion.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_940">Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil deis agam an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a thógáil ar an Athló agus go bhfuil an tAire i láthair.  Is buille mór do thionsclaíocht i gceantar Gaeltachta Ghaoth Dobhair dúnadh monarchan Euro Iompú Teoranta tráthnóna inné.  Mar atá ráite, tá breis agus trí scór post caillte de bharr dúnadh an tionscail sin.  Tá an tionscal lonnaithe ar Pháirc Ghnó Ghaoth Dobhair, nó ar Eastát Tionscalaíochta Ghaoth Dobhair mar a tugadh air roimhe seo, le breis agus fiche bliain agus chuir sé busanna den scoth ar fáil fá choinne margadh na tíre seo agus thar lear.  Bhi scaifte de dhaoine óga ag obair ann a bhí sár-oilte agus a raibh ard-scileanna acu fá choinne an obair thábhachtach sin a dhéanamh, ach anois tá na daoine sin fágtha gan fostaíocht.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Tá go leor poist caillte ar an eastát le roinnt blianta anuas, mar shampla, monarchana cosúil le Comar Yarns, RMT, Europlast, MDR Leictreonach Teo., BMR agus go leor eile.  Fuair an eastát buille i ndiaidh buille le roinnt blianta anuas agus shíl muid go raibh an t-am sin thart, ach is é seo an buille is deireanaí a fuair muid.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">Is tionscal é seo a fuair cabhair agus tacaíocht ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.  D'fhéadfá a rá gur tionscal áitiúil a bhí ann, mar gur bunaíodh é go h-áitiúil agus mar gur teaghlach áitiúil a thóg é agus a rinne forbairt air le fiche bliain.  Tá ár mbuíochas ag dul don teaghlach sin as an fhostaíocht a chuir siad ar fáil.  Ach mar adúirt mé, tá na poist sin caillte agus is beag deis do phoist eile atá ag na daoine a chaill iad.  Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire, ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus áisíneachtaí eile traenála agus mar sin gach cuidiú a chur ar fáil don cheantar le malairt fostaíochta a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd atá i ndiaidh a gcuid poist a chailliúnt.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">Yesterday's announcement by Údaras na Gaeltachta to the effect that Euro Coach Builders on the Gweedore industrial park will close with the loss of 62 jobs is another severe blow to employment in that Donegal Gaeltacht area.  Coming in the wake of so many other closures and job losses in the park in the past six or seven years, it leaves this part of County Donegal with possibly the highest unemployment rate in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">One could say that Euro Coach Builders was an indigenous industry in that it was created, grew and flourished for 24 years through the initiative and entrepreneurship of local business acumen.  It was a truly home grown industry and our thanks and gratitude go to Mr. Joseph Ferry and family who created and sustained the business for so many years and provided such excellent employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">Each job that has been lost is devastating for one family or another.  Many of those workers were the sole family bread winners with financial responsibilities, such as mortgage repayments and health and insurance charges.  It is tragic that there are few alternative employment opportunities in the area.  Skills and expertise have been built up through the years.  The workers are being relegated to the dole queues or the emigrants's trail.  There is little hope of alternative employment.  On my way to the Dáil this morning, I met two local young men on their way to Australia to join dozens of their friends who have already left.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">I appeal to the Minister, Údaras na Gaeltachta and all of the agencies to redouble their efforts in seeking and creating alternative employment for those affected.  Re-training must be provided, redundancy terms must be generous and new jobs, the only long-term solution to the problem, must be created.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Tá súil agam go bhfógróidh an tAire go ndéanfaidh sé iarracht speisialta le Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go gcuirfidh sé brú orthu tuilleadh fostaíochta a fháil don cheantar fíor-Ghaeltachta seo.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_948">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht na ceiste seo a thógáil.  Mar a deir sé, is cúis imní agus díomá dom féin agus d'Údaras na Gaeltachta aon phoist a bheith á gcailliúint in aon tionscal Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith liom a rá leis na fostaithe go dtuigim a gcás agus gur oth linn gur tharla sé seo.  Is cúis imní don Teachta McGinley, dá phobal agus do ghach éinne an líon poist atá caillte sa cheantar.  Caithfear a chur san áireamh go bhfuil lagú an-mhór tarlaithe i ngach earnáil le tamall anuas, mar gheall ar chuinsí náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta.  Ar an drochuair, tá drochthioncar aige seo ar leibhéal fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">Mar is eol don Teachta, cheadaigh an Ard-Chúirt comhshocraíocht a mhol scrúdaitheoir Euro lompú Teoranta don Chúirt i mí na Nollag 2007.  In Aibreán 2008, ghlac an t-údaras le togra forbartha a cuireadh faoina bhráid, ina raibh pacáiste deontais taighde agus forbartha, fostaíochta, caipitil, oiliúna agus eile de €1.465 milliún, d'fhonn cuidiú a chur ar fáil do Euro lompú Teoranta chun an gnó tógáil mótarchóistí agus busanna a dhaingniú agus a fhorbairt ar Pháirc Ghnó Ghaoth Dobhair.  Tá €716,843 den mhéid sin íoctha leis an gcomhlacht.  Dar ndóigh, mar is iondúil, beidh plé ar bun idir an t-Údaras agus an comhlacht i rith na míonna seo romhainn maidir le deontais a bhaineann leis an gcúnamh Stáit sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">Bhí 30 duine fostaithe in Euro lompú Teoranta ag an am agus bhí bainisteoir ginearálta ceaptha ag an chomhlacht, a bhí tar éeis straitéis forbartha gnó a ullmhú i gcomhar le príomhaithe an chomhlachta.  Chomh maith leis sin, bhí roinnt gnóthaí eile a bhí ag cur seirbhíse ar fáil agus a raibh nasc gnó cruthaithe acu le Euro lompú Teoranta, go háirithe ó thaobh oibreacha cumhdaigh agus seirbhísí innealtóireachtade.  Bhí sé beartaithe go dtiocfadh fás agus athbheochan ar an fhostaíocht indíreach seo i gcomhlachtaí Gaeltachta a bhí ag freastal ar riachtanais an chomhlachta le forbairt agus daingniú Euro lompú Teoranta féin.  Ba é 130 an sprioc nua fostaiochta don chomhlacht féin agus é faoi lánseol.  Ba é líon na bpost a bhí sa chomhlacht ag an deireadh na 62.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">Bhí idir déantús busanna agus seirbhís iardhíola le forbairt ag an gcomhlacht, dírithe ar mhargaí na hÉireann, na Breataine agus na Mór-Roinne.  Bhí deacrachtaí móra ag an gcomhlacht le heaspa díolacháin le roinnt míonna anuas, de bharr deacrachtaí trádála idirnáisiúnta san earnáil gluaisteáin agus mótarchóistí agus, ina cuideachta seo, an ráta malartú idir an euro agus sterling.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Nil aon amhras gur buille trom é seo don Ghaeltacht, ach caithfear a aithint go raibh an comhlacht seo ag feidhmiú go héifeachtach go dtí le déanaí agus gur cuinsí taobh amuigh de smacht an chomhlachta is mó ba chúis leis an gcinneadh atá déanta.  Tá sé cruthaithe ag an údaras gur féidir le infheistíocht nua a mhealladh go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus beifear ag féachaint le fostaíocht malartach a mhealladh go Gaoth Dobhair do na daoine a chaill a gcuid post.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">Ba mhaith liom aird a tharraingt ar chúrsaí fostaíochta ar Pháirc Ghnó Ghaoth Dobhair, áit a bhfuil méadú suntasach tagtha le cúpla bliain anuas ar an líon daoine atá fostaithe i gcliant-chuideachtaí de chuid Údaras na Gaeltachta.  Is dea-scéala é seo nuair a chuimhníonn muid go raibh an figiúr seo tite faoi 450 in 2003, tráth ar chailleadh líon mór post déantusaíochta ansin.  Tá go leor infheistíochta á dhéanamh ar an bPáirc Ghnó seo, ach go háirithe, forbairt ar Áislann Ghaoth Dobhair le lárionad ilfheidhmeach cultúrtha, pobail agus áineasa, ar chostas os cionn €8 milliún.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">Sa cheantar máguaird tá forbairtí tábhachtacha eile curtha ar bun le cúpla bliain anuas, mar shampla, leathnúchán ar lonad Seirbhisí Mara agus Turasóireachta ag cé Machaire Rabhartaigh, cultúrlann le 450 suíochán ag lonad Chois Locha i nDún Lúiche agus ionad fiontair agus pobail nua i Rann na Feirste.  Chomh maith leis sin, dar ndóigh, tá ionad fiontair tógtha ag Westbic i mBaile na Móna, Cill Chárthaigh.  Go hachomair, tá an t-Údarás dóchasach gur féidir malairt deiseanna fostaíochta a chur ar fáil i gceantar Ghaoth Dobhair sa ghearr go meántéarma.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">Mar fhocal scoir, is féidir liom a gheallúint don Teach seo go mbeidh mo Roinn ag tacú leis an údaras na hiarrachtaí leanúnacha atá ar bun aige chun fostaíochta a ghiniúint agus a dhaingniú sa Ghaeltacht.  Sa chomhthéacs sin, tá thart ar €35 milliún curtha ar fáil ag mo Roinn don údaras dá chlár gníomhaíochta sa bhliain 2009.  Is féidir liom a rá freisin go bhfuil mé dóchasach ón gcomhoibriú iomlán idir mé féin agus mo chomhghleacaí, an Tánaiste agus an tAire Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta, an Teachta Máire Ni Chochláin  — agus go deimhin idir an t-údaras, an IDA agus El — go mbeidh rath ar na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun le déileáil leis na dúshláin chun a chinntiú go mbeidh deiseanna fostaíochta fiúntacha inmharthanacha ar fáil do phobal Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_526">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_956">It is important that this House should have the opportunity to discuss the facts and consequences of last Friday's tiger kidnapping and bank heist, which resulted in the most substantial theft of cash in the history of the State.  It is clear from the reports on this robbery that criminal gangs have the resources and manpower to mount the type of surveillance operation the Garda no longer can carry out due to the financial constraints and cuts imposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The Garda is reported to be concerned at the volume and high grade of intelligence gathered on this occasion by the gang regarding the living arrangements of Mr. Travers and his colleagues and their role in Bank of Ireland.  At the same time, the Garda is reported to be furious that surveillance on the chief suspects in this raid had to be withdrawn due to a lack of funding.  Soon after the surveillance ceased, the raid took place and the surveillance was then reinstated, resulting in the arrest of some suspects and the recovery of a small amount of money.  In early December 2008, gardaí foiled two major attempted heists in counties Clare and Dublin, one involving a planned tiger kidnapping, thanks to a surveillance operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present in the House and I ask him whether he is satisfied that the Garda has the capacity to carry out surveillance on criminal gangs it suspects of being likely to carry out future raids and that effective Garda surveillance is the key to preventing such future raids.  The ease with which this operation was carried out is disturbing.  It will act as encouragement for others to follow suit.  Members have been told the State's financial institutions are now looking at security procedures.  At a hastily convened press conference after the event, the Minister stated this is happening.  What has held them back thus far?  How many tiger kidnappings have taken place in this State in the past 12 months?  What is the Minister doing about the fact that Dublin is now the tiger kidnapping capital of the world?  If he has the answer, he clearly is not engaged with the issue but is showing that his meeting with senior gardaí after the big heist is nothing but a charade.  If the Minister knows the answer, and I seek the figure from him this evening, why has he taken no action until now?  How often have representatives of the Garda Síochána or senior officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform met senior bankers in the past year in respect of security arrangements and similar matters?  What contingency plans have been in place to deal with tiger kidnapping?</p>
            <p eId="para_959">When this State was under threat and attack from terrorist organisations and the Provisional IRA in the 1970s and 1980s, it always held firm and did not buckle under pressure.  What action is the Minister now taking, or does he propose to take, to disabuse criminal gangsters of the notion that tiger kidnapping is an easy way to obtain millions, such as the €7.8 million handed over by Bank of Ireland last weekend?  The State and other financial institutions did not give in to terrorists in the past and it is essential they do not do so now.  The Minister is not encouraging and I ask him to take appropriate action on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">However, I am more than happy to reply to this Adjournment debate and to give the Deputy the figures he requested.  Last year, there were six so-called tiger kidnappings, six in the previous year and nine in the year before that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_964">Consequently, the Government's record is of a reduction in such activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">First, I wish to extend my sympathy to the victims caught up in this crime.  I am sure I speak for all sides of the House when I express my hope that they will soon recover from this awful trauma.  Members will also appreciate that it is incumbent upon me to remind the House that the robbery last Friday is the subject of an intensive and ongoing investigation.  A number of individuals have appeared in court charged in connection with it and I suggest that all Members should be careful to avoid saying anything that could be prejudicial to the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">There are agreed response procedures between the Garda Síochána and the banks and financial institutions to deal with hostage situations in which members of staff or their families are taken hostage to facilitate robberies.  These response procedures are detailed and all-encompassing.  It is clear that some of the aforementioned security protocols were not followed in this incident.  A number of questions arise regarding the apparent ease with which such a large amount of money was accessed.  I accept that everyone is worried about how easily this money was taken from this bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">Shortly after the incident, I had a conversation with the chief executive of the bank involved.  I also met the Garda Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner of operations in the immediate aftermath of the robbery.  Following our consultations, it was agreed that senior gardaí should immediately meet the heads of security of a number of financial institutions to consider the implications of last Friday's robbery.  That meeting took place yesterday and the institutions have undertaken to carry out a fundamental review of their procedures and to report back, while working with the Garda in this respect.  Further meetings are envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">It is no surprise that in the wake of ongoing improvements to the physical security of banks and to the cash in transit industry — Deputy Flanagan must admit the cash in transit issue has been taken care of reasonably successfully in recent years — these thugs have shifted their focus to the human vulnerability within the system.  In general, the Garda Síochána will continue to combat such so-called tiger raids as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs and the continuing measures being taken as part of Operation Anvil.  In recent years we have introduced tough new measures, including seven-day detention periods, that have been used in the recent past highly successfully by the Garda Síochána with the consent of the courts, for those suspected of various serious crimes, including kidnappings and mandatory sentences in respect of firearms offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The Garda is continuing to make every effort to defeat the crime gangs responsible and I reiterate that I will not be found wanting in ensuring that it has the necessary support, both from a resources and legislative perspective, to so do.  For example, I emphasise and have indicated in the House many times, the budget for Operation Anvil has been increased and ring-fenced from €20 million last year to €21 million this year.  This is in spite of an overall reduction in my Department's Estimate.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">In response to the claims made by the Deputy, while it would be completely counter-productive for me to comment on any detail of the surveillance activities of the Garda, I can confirm to him that the Garda Commissioner, at a follow-up meeting in this House today, assured me there is absolutely no basis for any suggestion that the resources devoted to the targeting and surveillance of such gangs have been reduced or withdrawn.  Such claims are as baseless as they are irresponsible.</p>

            <p eId="para_974">The Deputy is not correct in this regard.  The Government is devoting enormous resources to the fight against crime.  I have made it clear that it has absolute priority in the allocation of resources within my Department.  That will remain the case, even though I am criticised by Deputies opposite for the consequences of that approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The Government has also approved my proposals to introduce new legislation underpinning the use of covert surveillance methods by the Garda.  Under the legislation, the State will be able to use collateral material obtained by means of covert surveillance as evidence to support or strengthen the case for the prosecution at a criminal trial.  This legislation will be introduced to the Dáil shortly and should be of considerable assistance in achieving successful prosecutions of gang members.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_979">However, Members should not forget that the banks and other institutions have their part to play in this regard.  If tried and trusted protocols are put in place to defeat criminal attempts to rob cash, it is imperative that these are followed to the letter.  That is the important lesson from last Friday.  I echo the words of the chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland that the objective of the protocols is to provide for the "safety and well-being of all staff".  I have stated repeatedly that my primary priority is to focus on the fight against crime.  That remains the case.  By the end of this year, there will be just short of 15,000 gardaí on the streets, the same number which Deputy Flanagan's party pledged to have in place by the end of 2012, a full three years later.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">Regarding the events of last Friday, I do not underestimate the difficulties involved in trying to deal with incidents where people are taken hostage.  For those involved, their instinct is understandably to protect their loved ones.  However, this only makes it more important that financial institutions follow the robust protocols and procedures in place to ensure employees are, to the greatest possible extent, not placed in such a position in the first place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_983">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for discussion.  Home help services have been of enormous benefit to the many people throughout the State who avail of them.  These worthwhile schemes allow elderly people to remain in their homes, surrounded by their family, friends and community, thus enjoying a better quality of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">Some months ago, it came to my attention that the Health Service Executive was experiencing difficulties in providing home help services to all in need of them.  In some areas, no funding is available for new applicants, regardless of their level of need.  In other areas, staff can only provide home help to a new applicant when an existing patient no longer needs them.  In other words, staff are obliged to wait until one person dies before "recycling" home help hours.  In recent weeks, it has become clear that instances of cutting people's hours and placing applicants on long waiting lists have become increasingly prevalent throughout the State.  The many cases in my own constituency are undoubtedly replicated elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">For example, I was recently made aware of a shocking situation where an 83 year old man who is suffering from cancer, diabetes, and other complications was, upon his release from hospital, granted a mere one hour per day of assistance in the form of home help.  His family were pleased to receive even this much but they are under enormous pressure and in a very stressful situation.  I have come across cases where desperately needed hours of home help were drastically cut and where seriously ill people were put on waiting lists for home help.  Families are coming under severe pressure as a result of this shortfall in home help services.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">There has been a catalogue of decisions in recent months where the needs of older and more vulnerable people in our society were trampled by the Government.  The Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children should not erode by stealth the essential provision of home help for people who are seriously ill.  Will the Minister clarify the current situation?  I reiterate how invaluable these services are to people who wish to remain in their homes.  Given the large increases in unemployment, many people are now available to work with older people.  An emergency plan should be drawn up to ensure older people receive the assistance they need to enjoy the best possible quality of life.  Unemployed people should be allowed to register for some type of short-term scheme whereby they would assist elderly people in their homes.  This would relieve pressure on the nursing home subvention scheme and the health service in general while also providing employment in local communities.  If we do not look after older people, we cannot be proud of our society.  I urge the Government to introduce the type of emergency plan to which I referred.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_987">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht na ceiste seo a thógáil.  Beidh me in ann anois an fíorscéal a chur ar chuntas na Dála.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's continued commitment to services for older people generally and, in particular, to the important area of home care.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Government policy in regard to the elderly is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The home help service, delivered by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive, is a community service enabling people who otherwise might need to be cared for in long-term residential care to remain at home, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">It is important, in the context of the issue raised, to point out that the home help service has undergone a significant degree of professionalisation in recent years, with the implementation of the national home help agreement.  This has resulted in greater flexibility in service delivery and has improved consistency and service quality, through measures such as training, to the benefit of service users.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The home care package scheme is a relatively new scheme that has been developed in recent years throughout the State.  A package comprises a number of community-based services and supports, provided in a planned way to meet the needs of an older person.  The person will have significant medical, nursing or therapy requirements and may be recently discharged from hospital or at risk of being admitted to hospital if these needs are not met in a planned way.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The development of these services nationally in the period 2006 to 2008 reflects the prioritisation and significant investment by the Government in recent years.  This involved the allocation of €211 million in revenue funding, including €55.6 million in development funding.  Some 10.8 million hours were provided in 2006; 11.78 million in 2007; 11.96 million in 2008; and an estimated 11.98 million will be provided in 2009.  The numbers benefiting increased from 41,400 to 54,500 from 2006 to 2008, an increase of 13,100 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Community-based services for older people have also been augmented in the period 2006 to 2008 by the development of home care packages.  This involved the provision of €55 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007, with a further €10 million provided in 2008.  This gives a total of €120 million in development funding in this three-year period.  More than 4,600 packages were provided by the Health Service Executive in 2008, with some 8,700 people in receipt of a package at any one time and some 11,500 people benefiting during the course of last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">The Health Service Executive service plan for 2009 aims to deliver the same quantity and quality of home help and home care package services as delivered in 2008.  The capacity of the executive to provide approved levels of home help and home care package services continues to be reviewed in the context of overall resources available.  It is incumbent on each local health manager to ensure that both home help and home care packages are delivered within allocated budgets.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of resources.  As with every service, the Deputy will appreciate that there are not limitless resources available for the provision of home help and home care packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">Levels of services for home help and home care packages for existing clients are reviewed regularly and, as a result, the service in individual cases may increase, decrease or remain the same, based on the assessed needs of the individual.  Professional staff on the front line who are aware of local circumstances undertake individual client assessments and services are targeted at those with a high level of dependency, in accordance with assessed need.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">An individual assessment is undertaken in the case of new clients for home help or home care packages.  The requirements will vary from case to case and may subsequently change over time.  An example would be a person discharged from an acute hospital who may require a package for a period following discharge until he or she regained independence.  In this case, the level of service provided on discharge is kept under review and when the person is in a position to live more independently, the elements of a home care package may be adjusted in line with changed care needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">It is particularly relevant, in the context of the issue raised by the Deputy, to highlight that the Department of Health and Children has recently commenced an independent evaluation of the home care package initiative and a report on this, which will help inform future policy and service direction, is expected to be completed around mid-year.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">It is clear that the Government has made considerable improvements in recent years to enhance home care provision generally across the country.  There is no doubt that demand can at times exceed service resources.  It is a matter for the HSE, however, to deliver services both nationally and locally, in the context of Government priorities and its overall resources, and taking account of the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

          <heading>School Accommodation.</heading>
          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_544">
            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_998">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to speak on this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite a new school building for Forgney national school, County Longford, which was given the go-ahead in 2006, in light of the recent highly alarming engineer's report, which indicates that the 42-year old wooden pre-fab structure in which the school is accommodated is in a serious condition and in danger of collapsing.  This poses a major threat to the health and safety of the pupils and teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The comprehensive report was made by Cunningham Consulting Engineering Limited and has been with the Department of Education and Science and the Minister since before Christmas.  The most damning and specific finding of the report is that the temporary wooden structure in which the school has been accommodated for the past 42 years should be condemned and the site closed off.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The walls and roof are rotten, cannot be replaced and are ready to collapse on the children and teachers at any moment.  The windows are single glazed, the doors are a safety hazard and dampness is rife.  The structure, which I would not call a building, is similar to a slatted shed and cannot be heated because the storage heaters are obsolete and cannot be controlled.  It has a BER rating of G; there are no vents and there is rot and mould everywhere.  The public water supply to the building is contaminated and the wooden floors are rotten and patched.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">The threat posed by fire in this antiquated wooden structure is very real.  The entire wooden environment is no longer sound nor sustainable.  An accident is waiting to happen but I query whether it could be called an accident if it were to happen.  The Minister has been alerted to the dangerous state of the school on many occasions, so ignorance is not an excuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">Forgney national school was given the go-ahead for a new building in 2006 by the Department of Education and Science and the Minister after 40 years of lobbying but there was no follow through.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment, both here and in the other House, most recently last October.  I have made repeated representations on behalf of the school, the principal, the board of management, teachers, parents and pupils and I have worked tirelessly to achieve a safe and healthy built environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">Last year the cost of providing a new school building for Forgney was estimated at €1.3 million.  A state-of-the-art school could now be built for €850,000 to €900,000.  This is a small sum when contrasted with the €113 million that has been spent on pre-fabs throughout the country from 2006-2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The health and safety of the 33 children and teachers is my primary concern.  I ask the Minister to make it his concern and to provide the necessary funding to ensure the safety and well-being of the children of this school.  Should anything happen to the children in Forgney national school the finger of blame would point firmly at the Minister for Education and Science and the Department.  Condemning young children in the 21st century to a 40 year old substandard wooden structure is extraordinary and extremely dangerous, even for this Government.  The report by the building energy consultant, Cunningham Consulting Engineering Limited, ends as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1005">It is my professional opinion this school is no longer fit for purpose and that this has been the case for quite a considerable period of time.  The only reasonable course of remedial action is demolition and replacement with a modern, well designed and constructed building for the purpose of educating growing children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The ball is in the court of the Minister.  The safety of 33 children is in the hands of the Minister.  If there is not a response that this school will be built immediately, I want the Minister to meet the board of management, the principal and the parents because they are anxious and concerned at what may happen.  There may be a catastrophe if action is not taken immediately.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_545" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ó Cúiv</from>
            <p eId="para_1007">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht an ábhar seo a ardú.  I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who, unfortunately, cannot be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">Forgney national school has a staffing level of a principal and one mainstream assistant.  The school's enrolment at 30 September 2008 was 26 pupils.  The school authority has applied to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding for a new school building.  In the context of this application, the local inspector has confirmed that the school is expected to maintain its current enrolment and staffing level.  It is not, therefore, experiencing the rapid increase in enrolment that has occurred in other schools around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The Department of Education and Science uses published prioritisation criteria for advancing large scale building projects.  There are four band ratings under these criteria with band 1 being the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band ratings describe the type of works needed at a school and the urgency attaching to them.  A band 2 rating has been assigned to the proposed building project for Forgney national school reflecting the fact that the standard of its existing accommodation is such that it needs to be replaced by a new building.  The structural engineer's report recently filed in the Department of Education and Science by the school authority concurs with this, as expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy undertaking.  The extent of the demand on the capital budget of the Department of Education and Science is enormous providing, as it does, accommodation for new communities together with accommodation for the unprecedented number of extra teachers this Government has put into the system.  As well as this, much of the existing stock, like Forgney national school, must be modernised as a result of historic under-investment.  This will not all be achieved overnight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">Thousands of building projects were carried out under the last national development plan, NDP, to provide new and modernised educational infrastructure and thousands more will be carried out under the new NDP.  The commitment of this Government to ensuring that all children are educated in appropriate facilities to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum is evidenced by the scale of funding made available under both the former and current national development plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">A record €656 million has been made available for the school building programme alone in 2009.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on the public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure.  This will not only enable the provision of school places where they are needed but it will also allow the Department of Education and Science to build on the enormous progress made in extending and modernising existing buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The level of demand on the school building programme is such that not all projects can be carried out together.  They will have to be carried out in a structured and coherent manner and this is the reasoning behind the Department's prioritisation criteria.  The project for Forgney, as with all other building projects, will be consistent with this approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">In the interim, it is open to the school authority to apply to the Department of Education and Science for funding to repair the existing school building if the board of management deems this necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">In this regard, the Department has no record of having received an application from the board for summer works scheme funding, emergency works scheme funding or under the small schools scheme to address its needs.

            <p eId="para_1035">Because of the current budgetary constraints, it is not intended to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme at this time.  The matter will be reviewed again later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">A total of 57 applications were received under the current round of the Programme, of which 40 projects have been completed and opened to the public, 6 are under construction and eleven other projects are at various stages of the Programme — 1 is preparing tender documents, 7 are preparing contract documents and 3 are preparing preliminary reports.  The priority now is to work with the relevant local authorities in completing the remaining 17 pool projects, which are included in the current round.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">Since 2000 to end of December 2008 total expenditure under the current round of the programme has been €131m and this will leverage investment of €385.5m in respect of 46 pools.  A sum of €14m has been provided for 2009 to support existing projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">The Department has completed and published a Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme.  The Report examined, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The terms and conditions of any new round of the Programme will be devised taking into account the recommendations of the Report.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">On 13 January, the Secretary General of my Department, accompanied by the Assistant Secretary with responsibility for Tourism, met with the Chairman of the Commissioners of Public Works, and the Commissioner responsible for the management of visitor attractions in the care of the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">During this meeting, the officials of my Department reaffirmed the importance of the OPW attractions to our tourism offering and expressed concerns that a reduction in the season of opening or opening hours of visitor attractions would have a detrimental effect on the satisfaction levels of overseas and domestic tourists who found themselves unable to access the visitor attractions in question at a time which was suitable to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">It was suggested that, in the context of adjustments to the OPW budget, efforts could be made to maintain the existing opening arrangements for visitor attractions with a reduced staffing level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">The OPW Commissioners confirmed that the OPW would endeavour, as resources permitted, to continue to support the tourism product and informed my officials that the most significant visitor attractions operated by the OPW would retain the same opening arrangements as existed heretofore.

            <p eId="para_1045">As I stated in my reply to Questions. Nos.  822 to 847 of 27 January 2009, the position is that progress on these two commitments and the other commitments in the Programme for Government is being sustained commensurate with available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">A steering committee chaired by my Department has been established to oversee the Museum of Irish Literature project and work on the drafting of terms of reference for a scoping study is at an advanced stage.  If this scoping study is to be of real benefit, however, the time-lag between it and undertaking capital works on the premises to accommodate the Museum of Irish Literature would need to be quite short.  Nos. 20/21 Parnell Square have been identified as a suitable location for this museum but substantial capital funding would be required which is outside the scope and capacity of current budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">With regard to the establishment of a Sports Museum, my Department has held discussions with the National Museum of Ireland regarding how to carry this project forward.  The Museum has had initial contacts with sporting organisations on the availability of memorabilia in the context of the establishment of a National Sports Museum.  The Museum is to prepare proposals on housing the Sports Museum in Collins Barracks.  The Museum's priority at present for Collins Barracks is the provision of the new Centre Block, which is also a commitment in the Programme for Government.  The Sports Museum will be considered in the future in the light of available funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_1049">In my Department's Statement of Strategy 2008 — 2010, under the section relating to the five-year Programme for Government a series of commitments, in respect of sport, for achievement in the period to 2012, are included. I am pleased to say that action is being taken in a progressive manner in these areas to ensure that these targets are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">As Deputies will be aware many of the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government in relation to the promotion of sports in schools are a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">However, two specific commitments relate to the operation of the Sports Capital Programme. The first of these is to "Promote greater sharing of school and community sports facilities and make it a condition of the Sports Capital Programme that facilities be made available to schools where appropriate" and the second is to "Encourage more schools to apply for funding under the Sports Capital Programme by collaborating with their local sports clubs, and/or community groups."</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">Under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme, schools making joint applications with local sports clubs were required to provide evidence of formal agreements with local clubs that guarantee the clubs access to school facilities for at least 30 hours per week throughout the year.  In assessing applications, extra marks are also awarded to sports clubs that can show that they are allowing local schools to use their facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">I will be discussing with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, how his programme for the provision of sports halls in schools and the Sports Capital Programme might be dovetailed to provide greater value for money and enhanced facilities both for schools and the local community users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">Work on the development of a National Sports Facility Strategy is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment at national, regional and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">In addition, the Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">Through the Irish Sports Council and the National Governing Bodies of Sport and the Local Sports Partnerships there are many programmes being funded which aim to increase participation in sport by children and young people. I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the people who are involved in this work on the ground in introducing our children to sport that will complement and enhance both our school and community sport programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1058">On 2 December last, I announced the establishment of the Tourism Renewal Group.  The Group met for the first time on 18 December 2008 and has already met on two occasions since, on 27 January and on 24 February 2009.  I understand that the Group has agreed a calendar of regular meetings in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">This high-level Group, which is chaired by Maurice Pratt and comprises representatives of the tourism trade, national and international experts and senior public servants, has been tasked with reviewing and, where appropriate, renewing the current tourism strategy, set out in "New Horizons for Irish Tourism: an Agenda for Action 2003-2012".  The aim is to ensure that this strategy is focused for the short term and, looking further ahead, that the tourist industry is well placed to benefit from the upturn when it comes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">I have asked the Tourism Renewal Group to report back to me by the middle of 2009, following its considerations, with recommendations in the form of a Framework for Action for the period to 2013.  I am advised that the Tourism Renewal Group has agreed a work programme to meet this challenging timetable, commencing with an assessment of the current position and broadly-based consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">A key element of the Renewal Group's work is engaging with the tourism industry partners and wider interest groups.  I understand that the consultation process is underway.  The Chair has already made a general call for submissions from interested parties, and the Group will also be engaging directly with key actors in the tourism and related sectors in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">This process of consultation will ensure that the Group is well-informed on the current position and key trends across the board.  It will be the basis for its subsequent work of analysis and recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1066">I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 77 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">The Department pro-actively engages in a range of supports to facilitate philanthropy and sponsorship in the arts, culture and sport. Tax Relief Scheme — Arts/Culture</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">Section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended, is a scheme of tax relief for the donation of heritage items to the National Collections.  The scheme allows heritage items that are considered outstanding examples of their type and that are pre-eminent in their class to be donated to an approved body, with 80% of the market value of the items capable of being offset against the current tax liability of the donor.  The scheme has an upper limit of €6 million in respect of any one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">The Department chairs and provides the secretariat for the Selection Committee, on which the Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the National Cultural Institutions and the Arts and Heritage Councils are represented,  that is charged with deciding if proposed donations meet the heritage requirements set out in the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">All the National Cultural Collecting Institutions that hold National Collections can benefit from the scheme, as can a range of other cultural institutions funded by the State.  Details of all donations made under the scheme — which have been very considerable over the years — are publicly available on the Department's website. Tax Relief Scheme — Sport</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">In the sports sector, Section 847a of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended, is a scheme of tax relief on donations made to approved sports bodies for the funding of sports capital projects.  The scheme applies to donations of more than €250 made towards expenses incurred by an approved sports body in relation to a capital project, such as the construction of a building, the purchase of land, the purchase of permanently based sports equipment, and the improvement of playing surfaces and facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">On the basis of such donations, individual taxpayers on the self-assessment system are able to claim relief on their annual tax returns as a deduction from their total income. A corporate entity may claim relief on a donation by treating it as a deductible trading expense.  The scheme has an upper limit on the amount against which tax relief can be claimed of €40 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">The Department is responsible for the assessment of applications under the scheme.  It also works closely with the Revenue Commissioners in its administration, with quarterly reports provided to the latter on all projects given approval. Culture Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">In addition to these tax relief schemes, Culture Ireland, which forms part of the Department, co-ordinates with 'Business to Arts' — a non-profit organisation that promotes business sponsorship of the arts — in relation to some strategic arts promotions abroad.  The aim of this co-ordinated activity is to help create opportunities for companies to secure additional sponsorship for events supported by Culture Ireland. IBEC and ISME</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">While I am satisfied that the existing supports for philanthropy and sponsorship are working well, to the considerable benefit of the cultural and sporting life of the community, the Department is continually seeking new avenues to facilitate philanthropic and sponsorship support for our artistic, cultural and sporting heritage.  In this regard, consideration is being given to engaging with business umbrella bodies such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises organisation with a view to promoting funding opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1079">The next phase of the development of the National Museum at Collins Barracks is the provision of the new Centre Block building.  The development of the Centre Block has not been cancelled.  Progress on the project is at an advanced stage and the Office of Public Works is currently finalising tender documents, which should be ready by April. Expenditure on the project would fall mainly in 2010 and subsequent years and a final funding allocation for the Vote of the Office of Public Works where funding for this project would be provided has not as yet been decided for those years.  Given the current budgetary situation, officials of my Department have been engaged with the Office of Public Works and the National Museum in order to ensure that the project will be well placed to progress immediately, when funding becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">When completed the proposed Centre Block at Collins Barracks will include major new exhibition galleries on two themes. The World Culture Gallery will display the Museum's extensive ethnographical collections and the History of Ireland Gallery will trace the major economic, social and artistic developments in Ireland from the mid-17th century onwards. It will also include a facility to exhibit the Asgard sailing ship which is undergoing conservation work at present.

            <p eId="para_1085">The conservation of the Asgard is a unique project to protect in the long term a vessel of both National and international importance for future generations to view and appreciate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1091">The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and for increasing participation in recreational sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">The ISC, under its research remit, is striving to develop a profound understanding of sport in Ireland that can inform policy and investment over the coming years. The ISC has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake studies on sport and physical activity on its behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">The 2007 Irish Sports Monitor (ISM) report, which was published in February, is the first in an ongoing series of annual reports that will measure and track participation in Irish sport. Based on a nationally representative sample of nearly 10,000 adults aged 16 and over the ISM offers the most detailed picture yet of sporting life in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">The 2007 ISM report provides a number of headline figures for participation in sport and physical activity in Ireland, which serve as benchmarks for future performance regarding physical activity, participation in sport and recreational walking, volunteering, club membership and attendance at sporting events. The report also reinforces previous research findings in relation to social and economic gradients in participation, and to the relative popularity of particular sporting activities. It also provides key new insights on issues such as Ireland's standing relative to international participation levels, seasonal and regional variations in participation, and links between nationality and playing sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">The programme of research being carried out by the Irish Sports Council is very useful in informing the development of the Government's policy on sport.</p>

            <p eId="para_1100">All of the agencies under my Department's remit with overseas responsibilities are aware of the need to promote a positive image of Ireland overseas and cooperate with other State agencies in this regard as appropriate. Tourism Ireland, as the organisation with responsibility for the overseas marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination, has a key role in ensuring that our overseas image continues to be a positive one. Similarly, Culture Ireland promotes the best of Ireland's arts and culture internationally and assists in the development of Ireland's international cultural relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">Tourism Ireland undertook a major review of the island of Ireland Brand in 2007 which involved wide ranging consultation with a broad range of agencies including Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Bord Bia and Waterways Ireland. Arising from this major brand review, Tourism Ireland has developed a new marketing communications campaign which is currently rolling out in markets across the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">In terms of practical inter-agency cooperation, Tourism Ireland and Culture Ireland work closely to bring the best of Ireland's artists, writers, musicians and dancers to the attention of new audiences overseas. Furthermore, Tourism Ireland works with Horse Racing Ireland to promote Irish horse racing festivals; with the Irish Film Board in promoting Ireland as a location for film-making, as well as cooperating with Fáilte Ireland on product, niche and regional tourism marketing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">Tourism Ireland and Culture Ireland also engage with Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Government Departments in the organisation of overseas trade missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The Deputy may also be interested to know that, on 11 February, I met with the heads of fifteen State tourism agencies, arts bodies and cultural institutions to begin the work of further developing the cultural tourism market.  This is the first step in implementing my undertaking to put in place an initiative to further develop the potential of cultural tourism.  This initiative will build, on the first instance on the cooperation and synergy between the institutions under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">In the current challenging economic climate I am acutely aware that Ireland's overseas image is more important than ever. Accordingly, my Department and I will continue to work with the agencies to avail of every opportunity to promote positive images of Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1107">As the Deputy is aware, the levying of rates and service charges is an independent function of the Local Authorities. I am acutely conscious of the impact of the various local authority charges on the hotel and hospitality sector and indeed the Tourism Strategy Implementation Group raised the issue in its June 2008 report to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">I am also aware that the Commission on Taxation is also examining funding of Local Authorities and my Department has stressed to the Commission that there is a need for broad based funding of local authorities that should not unreasonably discriminate between economic sectors. I have also strongly advised the industry to engage directly with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">While I recognise that Local authorities must be able to raise revenue in order to fulfil their mandates I am anxious to avoid charges that could have a detrimental effect on the competitiveness and performance of the tourism industry.

            <p eId="para_1111">In accordance with the provisions of section 8(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, it is a day to day matter for Fáilte Ireland to encourage, promote and support either inside or outside the State (a) the development of Tourism traffic within and to the state and (b) the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services within the State.  In that context Fáilte Ireland continues to support major sporting events in Ireland which, inter alia, can set as a marketing tool for Irish tourism.  For example in the period 2006-2007 Fáilte Ireland has provided support to the Ryder Cup (2006), the World Rally Championship round (2007 and 2009) and the Irish Open Golf tournament (2008).</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">Following an approach from the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, I provided a strong letter of support to the Irish bid to host the event referred to by the Deputy.

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1114">At the outset it is necessary to describe the background to the concept of a sports campus at Abbotstown. The concept emerged from the 1999 PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study "A Stadium for a New Century." In January 2000 the Government adopted the study and decided to proceed with the development of Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown with Stadium Ireland as its centrepiece. At this time the Government also decided to build the National Aquatic Centre to be ready for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in June 2003. The National Aquatic Centre, the first element of the Campus, was completed on time and within budget at a cost of €62.5m. and was opened in March 2003.  The Government decided in January 2004 to proceed with the development of Lansdowne Road as a 50,000 capacity stadium. At the same time the Government also approved the phased delivery of a sporting campus at Abbotstown to include medical and training facilities, administrative facilities, and eventually, with private investment, an indoor sports arena.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">From 2004 to the end of 2008, the combined total of both capital and current expenditure on the National Sports Campus was €19.2 million. Of that amount, some €7.3 million capital was spent on the refurbishment of the former State Laboratories as the new headquarters for the FAI. An amount of €2.6 million capital has been incurred in developing the design for the Phase 1 facilities as provided for in the Development Control Plan prepared for the National Sports Campus and progressing these plans to planning application stage.  A budget of €1.7 million capital has been provided for the refurbishment of the former Central Meat Control Laboratory as the new headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">As I have previously stated in response to questions on the overall development, I am reviewing with the NSCDA how we might best advance the Campus project during 2009 and following years taking into consideration the current difficult economic constraints.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1119">I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 for the purpose of giving support to both racing industries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">Under the provisions of the Act, the Fund has, from 2001 to 2008, received a guaranteed level of finance each year. This was based on excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation. Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty was made up by direct Exchequer subvention. €69.6m has been allocated to the Fund for 2009.  Both industries proposed that an increase on the rate of betting tax would obviate the need for exchequer funding to be provided to supplement the current take from the 1% betting tax take on off course betting.  I indicated to the Minister for Finance that I supported that proposal and as the Deputy will be aware the rate of betting duties is being increased to 2% with effect from 1st May 2009.  This will bring the funding of the industries more into line with international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">The rationale of the Fund was that horse and greyhound racing needed certainty in relation to its funding support on a multi-annual basis and that the mechanism for such certainty should be should be derived from the duty generated from off-course betting. Prior to 2001 the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bodies were funded with annual grant-in-aid allocations as well as 0.3% of turnover and a fixed fee from off-course betting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">Section 12(6) of the Act specifies that, of the moneys paid into the Fund each year, 80% shall be paid out to Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and 20% shall be paid out to Bord na gCon (BNG).</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Funding of both of these agencies supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding &amp; training enterprises in the development of the rural economy. These industries, together, account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy including farm incomes. The funding given to the greyhound racing sector helps in sustaining a tradition that has existed for hundreds of years and in underpinning the economic activity in what are in many instances less affluent regions of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">Since the establishment of the Fund a period of major development of both the horse and greyhound racing industries has resulted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">This funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing.  Horse Racing Ireland has undertaken a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">The Fund has also contributed significantly to the almost €90 million that has been invested in the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">A review of the Fund is nearing completion and will be submitted to the Government in due course in the context of deciding on the future funding of these industries. Any extension of the Fund will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">Revenue receipts through excise duties, and projections of same, are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">I would also refer the Deputy to my answer to priority question number 43 which I answered earlier today.</p>

            <p eId="para_1136">In relation to the development of a National Sports Campus at Abbotstown, the prevailing difficult economic conditions has meant that no funding has been provided to date to advance the Phase I development in 2009.

            <p eId="para_1138">The Agreed Programme for Government commits to the roll out of the Local Sports Partnership programme on a nationwide basis to provide for the development of sport at local level.  The Irish Sports Council has a statutory role in the promotion and development of sport, including initiatives such as the Local Sports Partnership network, through which sports initiatives at local level are delivered and coordinated.  While funding of the LSPs is a matter for the ISC, understand that the Irish Sports Council, even with a reduced budget for 2009, intends to continue with its support of the LSP initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">The Local Sports Partnerships are charged with increasing participation at a local level, ensuring that local resources are used to best effect and making sure that the experiences of participants in sport are positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">Following an independent review of the LSPs by Fitzpatrick Associates in 2005, approval was given to the ISC to extend the LSP network from 2006 on a national basis.  Accordingly, funding has been provided to the ISC to facilitate continued extension of the network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">33 LSPs have been established in the following locations: Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork City, County Cork, Donegal, Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Galway City, Galway County, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick City, Limerick County, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, North Tipperary, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South County Dublin, South Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The Fitzpatrick Report identified the need for the introduction of a formal monitoring and evaluation framework for the LSPs. In April 2008 the Irish Sports Council published the first SPEAK report detailing the work of the Local Sports Partnerships and its evaluation of the impact that this has on the clubs and communities across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The ISC recognises the importance of the use of an enjoyable multi-sport and non-competitive model to introduce our children to sport that will complement and enhance both our school and community sport programmes.  With this in mind the Council has developed the Buntús Programmes (Generic and Start), which are exciting programmes developed to support teachers and childcare practitioners in introducing young people to sport and physical activity. The programmes are rolled out through the Local Sports Partnerships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">456,000 children have participated in Buntús and Buntús Start programmes.  I look forward to the Local Sports Partnership Network having a major impact at local level in introducing our people, particularly the young, to sport and physical activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">The nationwide audit of sports facilities is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, commenced in 2008 with the assistance of Local Authorities.  Already, my Department has received completed returns from 16 Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  My Department is currently finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the country. The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy also identifies the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact in the relevant areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1156">In accordance with the provisions of section 8(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, it is a day to day matter for Fáilte Ireland to encourage, promote and support either inside or outside the State (a) the development of Tourism traffic within and to the state and (b) the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services within the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">An Innovation Fund was launched in 2008 to offer assistance in respect of feasibility studies for innovative tourism products.  A number of feasibility studies for new products have been supported under this Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">Through its Environment Unit, established in 2006, Fáilte Ireland has been promoting environmental sustainability in a number of areas.  Environmental good practice guidelines for festivals and events, and cruising have been published and grant applicants for the Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative are asked to state what they have done to make the event more environmentally sustainable. A copy of the environmental guidelines is issued with every grant application form.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">Environmental guidelines are currently being prepared for the golf sector and for business tourism, both of which will be published later in 2009.  Fáilte Ireland is also a partner of the Leave No Trace network which promotes responsible use of the countryside and the application of this code of practice is attached as a condition to a number of relevant grant-aided projects that involve use of natural areas for recreation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">A review of all tourism and hospitality education and training courses delivered throughout the State has just been completed by Fáilte Ireland to ascertain the current level of sustainability content in these courses.

            <p eId="para_1161">During 2009, Fáilte Ireland plans to liaise with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in undertaking a review of its grant aid procedures insofar as they affect Natura 2000 sites to ensure that any grant applications which may involve a Natura 2000 are adequately and appropriately assessed.</p>

         the legislation in place with regard to service contracts for companies who own their own units or premises but units are located in industrial parks owned by another company and whereby these individual units are required to make payment for services including lighting, security and other facilities such as car parking and so on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1290">There is no specific legislation in place regulating service contracts between businesses operating in industrial parks and the owners of such parks.  Contractual relations between businesses, unlike those between businesses and consumers or between employers and employees, are not generally subject to extensive statutory regulation.  Traditionally, the presumption has been that contracts between businesses are agreements freely entered into by the parties and that, if disputes arise, there are well-established legal procedures and remedies available for dealing with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">Part IV of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 provides that, in every contract for the supply of a service, the following terms are implied</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">(a) that the supplier has the necessary skill to render the service,</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">(b) that he will supply the service with due skill, care and diligence,</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">(c) that, where materials are used, they will be sound and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required, and</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">(d) that, where goods are supplied under the contract, they will be of merchantable quality within the meaning of section 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">Sections 40 and 41 of the 1980 Act set out the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, a contract term implied by virtue of section 39 can be negatived or varied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">Part V of the 1980 Act deals with the issues of contract rescission for innocent misrepresentation and of damages and exclusion of liability for misrepresentation and supplements the common law rules in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">Employees, employers and others who have concerns in relation to the application of employment legislation at a place of employment may contact, or make an official complaint to, the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). The Authority's Inspection Services can be contacted on Lo-call 1890 220 100 and at inspection@employmentrights.ie.  The official complaint form is available from NERA by telephoning the Lo-call number or making a request by email and can be downloaded from the Authority's website, www.employmentrights.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">It should be noted also, that in many cases, workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, depending on the underpinning employment rights legislation, take the matter to the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or to the Labour Court.  This can be done directly or by a representative on the employee's behalf, including a Trade Union representative.  For example, complaints in relation to the National Minimum Wage or working hours can be made to the Rights Commissioner Service, while complaints in relation to minimum notice and redundancy can be made to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  NERA can advise on the most appropriate avenue of redress.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 to 98, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">A number of measures have been initiated to assist all apprentices progress and complete their apprenticeships. The Department of Social and Family Affairs are immediately referring to FÁS all redundant apprentices for assistance. FÁS then, through their Employment Services and Services to Business Divisions, work in collaboration to provide guidance and support in sourcing a new employer and to consider further options.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">As an interim measure FÁS has amended the scheduling rules for off-the-job training to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training, at either Phase 2, Phase 4 or Phase 6, in accordance with the existing scheduling criteria. It is expected that in excess of 1,200 redundant apprentices from all trades will receive such off-the-job training this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">Redundant apprentices from all trades may also avail of existing specific skills training courses provided by FÁS. Redundant apprentices who participate in these courses will benefit by increasing their skill levels and enhancing their employability.  In addition, redundant apprentices can also avail of the range of trade related night courses that are available in FÁS training centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">The construction and electrical family of trades have specific support available to them at present in the form of the Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme. This scheme is limited to these trades as they have been most severely affected by the downturn in the construction sector and they account for the majority of apprentices currently in the apprenticeship system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">The Government and the various stakeholders will continue to consider other possible measures to assist redundant apprentices from all trades in progressing their respective apprenticeships.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1426">The Government recently introduced a Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, called "Building Ireland's Smart Economy" which sets out a clear roadmap for Ireland's move back to economic growth and prosperity.  The Cabinet Committee for Economic Renewal will drive this strategy and we will continue to pursue policies that will build on our strengths, address our weaknesses and maximise economic activity and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">Across Government, we are taking exceptional measures to tackle the challenges that we face with a strong focus on helping enterprises and saving jobs.  Through the work of the Cabinet Committee we are identifying specific short-term measures which would have an immediate impact on sustaining employment and competitiveness.  Once the package of short-term measures has been finalised, focus will be placed on implementation of these and the wider competitiveness and enterprise agenda under the ‘Smart Economy' framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Within my own Department I am driving implementation of the areas falling under my responsibility covering enterprise, labour, research and innovation and competitiveness issues.  We are also committed to implementing the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, which underpins our attractiveness as a location for investment and sustaining high value jobs across the economy.  Through the SSTI, our immediate objective is to increase the "commercialisation" of R&amp;D investments to support blue chip employment opportunities through the creation of cutting edge start-up companies, creation and transfer of intellectual property and most importantly the absorption of highly skilled people into industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">For those people who have lost their jobs, we are re-focusing our skills and training budgets to help these people back into employment as quickly as possible. We are also reviewing current training programmes, including those provided by FÁS and Skillnets, in the context of current and future labour market challenges, including the goals of the National Skills Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">I believe that we have to take concrete steps to show solidarity with enterprise and in particular the exporting sector.  Restoring cost competitiveness is a particular focus of action.  Cost competitiveness remains critical to ensuring that companies based in Ireland have the ability to compete successfully in international markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">The Government's Recapitalisation Scheme for Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland announced on Wednesday 11 February 2009, is a fundamental requirement in restoring stability to our financial sector.  Such stability will ensure that the financial institutions can actively contribute to our economic activity and particularly support our enterprise sector.  As part of the Recapitalisation Package, my Department will continue to remain in regular contact with the Department of Finance and will ensure that issues such as the availability of credit to SMEs are kept under constant review so that SMEs can continue to operate effectively and with certainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">In general, a Moldavian national who wishes to migrate to seek employment in the State is subject to the requirements of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006. However, there are circumstances in which a foreign national present in the State may be eligible to take up employment in the State without the need for an employment permit. These circumstances are, in the main, related to the current immigration status of the person and are generally a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">In the absence of further details in relation to the particular circumstances of the case it is not possible to give any further information. However, general information on employment permits is available at the website of my Department (www.entemp.ie). Information concerning immigration matters is available at the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).  Alternatively, the person may wish to contact either of these Departments with regard to his or her particular circumstances.</p>

        <b>Deputy Andrew Doyle</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the support available for young innovators, in particular the successful exhibitors in the Young Scientist Exhibition. 
        [8721/09]

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_591">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1436">Young innovators and in particular the successful exhibitors in the Young Scientist Exhibition have many options open to them in terms of further education, careers in science or in enterprise. One of the first challenges must be to maintain the interest of such talented young persons in science, technology or engineering.  The Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) Programme, which is administered by Forfás on behalf of my Department, continues to promote study in the priority areas of science, engineering and technology.  The programme is now gearing up to replicate at second level the success it has had with programmes like Discover Primary Science at primary level, and is extending its reach to promote maths as a key underpinning discipline.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">DSE continues to work closely with BT in organising and promoting the annual Young Scientist Competition. DSE uses the opportunity of its presence to demonstrate the approaches encompassed in the new Science, Engineering and now maths curricula through a continuously running set of workshops.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">For students still at second level, the Student Enterprise Awards scheme  (SEA) is a practical enterprise programme developed by the County and City Enterprise Boards to give second level students the opportunity to develop their own business.  The objective of the programme is to encourage students to consider entrepreneurship as a future career choice and to enhance their entrepreneurial skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">As they move into third level, the Enterprise Ireland Student Enterprise Awards offer students from all academic disciplines the chance to realise their entrepreneurial ambitions. Sponsored by Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland and Cruickshank Intellectual Property Attorneys, the Student Enterprise Awards are Ireland's largest  and longest established third level student enterprise competition designed to promote innovation and entrepreneurship amongst third level students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">Science Foundation Ireland operates a stand and also sponsors one of the prizes at the Young Scientist Exhibition each year. For those who choose to pursue a career in research, the SFI ‘President of Ireland Young Researcher Award' (PIYRA) is Science Foundation Ireland's most prestigious award for young researchers to carry out their research in third level institutions in Ireland. The programme commenced in 2004 and the awards recognize outstanding engineers and scientists who, early in their careers, have already demonstrated or shown exceptional potential for leadership at the frontiers of knowledge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">For innovative individuals who wish to start a business, a wide range of supports is available through the County Enterprise Boards or through Enterprise Ireland. These range from advisory supports to intense support for High Potential Start-Up companies, and supports to help companies grow and prosper. These also include support with commercialisation of ideas and protection of intellectual property.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, provides funding of €400,000 annually towards the running costs of the BT Young Scientist and Technology exhibition, €35,000 towards the Young Social Innovators programme, and also funds the provision of a full-time co-ordinator in the Business in the Community initiative in disadvantaged areas.  These programmes are successful in motivating students to develop their research, planning, evaluation, teamwork, self-directed learning, science and enterprise skills in keeping with the objectives of the curriculum, as well as providing the opportunity to showcase their skills and meet like minded peers. Schools provide extensive support to prepare students for participation in programmes such as the BT Young Scientist, the Student Enterprise Awards, Young Social Innovators, and Technology Exhibition, and Business in the Community Initiatives, and co-operate extensively to help the operation of these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">Further actions in the Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal which will foster innovation among young people, including the commitment to link Young Scientist winners with a third level institution and/or a firm to enable them to bring their idea to development and to provide the top three finalists with laboratory/research space in universities during the summer, are being developed under the aegis of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">On the publication of Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008 on 20 November 2008 I clarified in the press conference that the income levy would not be applied to income earners with an entitlement to the medical card. A press release containing this information was published on my Department's website and issued to all national media outlets that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">In my second stage speech for Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008 on 25 November 2008 in the Dáil, I again clarified that individuals with an entitlement to the medical card would be exempt from the income levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">In advance of the introduction of the income levy, Revenue met with all the major payroll providers and apprised them of all the features of the income levy including the exemption for those with an entitlement to the medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">On 24 November 2008 Revenue published a guide to the income levy on its website. This guide is aimed at the general public, employers, employees and the self employed. It is produced in an easy to read "frequently asked questions" (FAQ) format and sets out in a number of questions and answers how those with an entitlement to a medical card are to be treated for income levy purposes. Revenue notify specific groups, such as pension providers, payroll software developers and other interested parties, of changes to this document on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">An "Income Levy Fact Sheet" was circulated to Revenue Public Offices on 14 January 2009 outlining the income levy in general, including details of the medical card exemption. This was made available to all persons who asked for details of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">The Revenue Aertel pages were also updated, with effect from 16 December 2008, to make a specific mention of the full medical card exemption. This information is available on page 591 (subpage 10) of Aertel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">Since the announcement of the income levy an employer's telephone help-line service has been provided by the Collector-General's Office. This service addresses all queries raised on the operation of the income levy by employers and pension providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1588">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State must register for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) purposes within one working day of arrival.  This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non EU persons.  In practice, Revenue allows latitude of a maximum of seven days for registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">However, Section 135 (a) of the Finance Act 1992 permitted a European or other foreign-registered vehicle which was temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State, to be exempted from the requirement to register for VRT purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">Section 64 of the Finance (No.2) Act 2008 amends this section to provide for the registration (without the payment of VRT) of vehicles temporarily brought into the State for a period greater than 42 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">When the new temporary registration system comes into effect, the vehicle owner will be required to register with Revenue and receive a temporary number plate, which will have to be displayed on the vehicle. This will provide a mechanism whereby Revenue can maintain a record of vehicles benefiting from this exemption, quickly identify applicants who are not eligible for a temporary exemption and must immediately pay any VRT due; and identify vehicles coming to the end of a period of temporary exemption (i.e. one year), so that VRT can be collected when it becomes due. In addition the amendment provides that vehicles seeking temporary registration will be required to undergo a pre-registration test as a pre-condition for registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">The Deputy may wish to note that Revenue mobile units and An Garda Síochána continue to monitor both Irish and foreign-registered vehicles on our roads as part of their regular and ongoing enforcement activity. For their part, Revenue mobile units challenged 20,669 vehicles last year. Of these, some 15,231 satisfied Revenue officials that the registration status was in order at that particular time and no further action was taken. 5,438 vehicles required further investigation and action including registration and payment of VRT, seizure of vehicle, export of vehicle, grant of transfer of residence relief or temporary exemption, and reports for prosecution. In addition to the VRT collected, penalties totalling €1,109,315 were imposed in respect of these vehicles. In 2008, some 55,000 second hand vehicles were registered and the total VRT paid amounted to €190m.</p>

         his views on whether it is necessary to review and amend section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997, in view of the prevailing economic climate, increasing loan arrears and the restrictions currently in place on credit unions with respect to the restructuring of loan repayment schedules for a duration exceeding five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_612">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1657">A core objective of the legislative and regulatory framework for Credit Unions in Ireland is to ensure the safety and soundness of credit unions.  This requires prudent lending and protection of members' savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">The restrictions contained in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997, as amended, are an important asset and liability tool that have protected the financial stability of the credit union movement over many years. The funding of credit unions is predominately provided on a short term basis in the form of on-demand savings and consequently the Section 35 limits are necessary for the protection of the financial stability of credit unions.  I believe that the legislation, as it stands, strikes an appropriate balance between the development needs of credit unions and the protection of members' savings from undue risk.  I am of the view that it would not be appropriate to change the current position with regard to the limits contained in Section 35, especially in the current financial and economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">As the Deputy will be aware, Section 35 sets out the limits with which credit unions must comply in respect of the total amount of loans advanced for periods exceeding 5 years and 10 years. Section 35 was revised in 2007 in line with the recommendations contained in the report of the Review Group on Longer Term Lending Limits. This Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, included representatives from the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Registrar of Credit Unions. Arising from the review, those credit unions that can satisfy certain financial criteria in relation to arrears and reserves and have the necessary controls in place can, subject to the approval of the Registrar, avail of increased lending limits. There was a further change to Section 35 in 2007 by way of Section 17 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 which changed the basis of calculation of the total amount of loans outstanding for the purposes of applying the limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">I fully appreciate that some credit union customers are experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances on account of the deterioration in the overall economic climate and consequently are requesting a reduction in their loan repayments.  I understand that the Registrar of Credit Unions has recommended to credit unions that, where rescheduling needs to happen, revised repayment instalments should be agreed with the borrower as is necessary but the term of the loan should not be changed from the original agreement.  This approach would satisfy the borrower's need to reduce repayments but would also ensure a transparent arrears position.  The calculation of the provision for bad and doubtful debts would also be calculated in a realistic fashion.  The Registrar has highlighted the need to ensure that rescheduling of loan repayments should be carried out in a fashion which is fully consistent with accurate reporting of the arrears and provisioning situation of credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">My Department has been in contact with the Consumer Directorate in the Financial Regulator to request consideration of a guidance note for credit unions providing advice on dealing with members experiencing difficulties with loan repayments and building on general guidance on this issue already published on the Financial Regulator's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">‘Whistleblowing' is usually interpreted to mean the reporting, in good faith, of a breach or potential breach of the law, and the according of a measure of protection to the person reporting, against penalisation by the entity about whom the report has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">Whistleblowing provisions currently exist in Irish legislation relation to Child Abuse, Ethics in Public Office, Health and Safety, Competition and Consumer Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The Company Law Review Group, the statutory advisory expert body charged with advising the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment on the review and development of company law in Ireland, examined the inclusion of ‘whistleblowing' provisions in Irish companies legislation in 2007.  The majority recommendation was that a company law-specific whistle-blowing provision should not be included in the new Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill taking into account  the degree of malpractice, the required nature and extent of the disclosure, the reputational risk for companies and the extra resources, or diversion of resources, for the enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">The Group however observed that this is a matter which needs to be considered also in the context of appropriate legislation governing the employer-employee relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">As illustrated by the view in the majority report of the Company Law Review Group, this is a complex issue and I would also point out that relevant provisions of EU law need to be considered. However, this is a matter that I will consider further given recent disclosures regarding corporate governance in a specific credit institution and in particular in light of the outcome of ongoing investigations of these matters by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Financial Regulator.</p>

            <p eId="para_1685">I presume the Deputy's question refers to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) who is a statutory officer who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with Financial Service Providers that have not been resolved by the providers after they have been through the internal complaints resolution systems of the providers. All personal customers, limited companies with a turnover of €3m or less, unincorporated bodies, charities, clubs, partnerships, trusts etc. can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman. It is a free service to the Complainant, compensation up to €250,000 can be awarded and decisions are binding subject to appeal to the High Court.</p>

            <p eId="para_1687">However I am advised by the FSO that each submitted complaint is considered on its merits and it may well be that aspects of a complaint may be possible to investigate while matters which occurred more than six years are not.

The FSO is independent and impartial in the exercise of his powers and the Minister has no role with respect to how he deals with a particular complaint.</p>

         the assumptions used by his Department in estimating the so-called tax buoyancy effects of tax and spending changes in 2009.

            <p eId="para_1695">Adjustments in tax policy or expenditure have an impact on the economy in that they can result in changes in consumption and investment patterns leading to changes in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy is a function of the marginal propensity to consume and generally changes in policy are assumed to lead to a buoyancy factor in the range of 20 to 30 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Based on the latest information available at end-2008, the Addendum to the Irish Stability Programme Update published by the Department of Finance on 9 January forecast that €36,995 million would be received in tax revenue in 2009, a decrease of 9.25% on the amount received in 2008. This forecast was made using the assumption that reductions of up to €2 billion would be secured in expenditure this year. Consequently, the macroeconomic impact of reducing expenditure had been factored in to the estimate of tax buoyancy that underpinned the Department's forecast for 2009 tax revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1698">The impact of any form of government spending on the economy crucially depends upon the nature of such spending.  In this regard, spending money on investment is no different, and the economic impact of an additional €100 million on investment will be very much dependent upon the type of investment that is undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">With this in mind, I would point out that €100 million represents in gross terms approximately 0.05% of GDP.  However, it should be noted that the economic impact depends on the import content of production as well as construction price developments.  The labour market effects of such activity will depend on the employment intensity of that activity, which of course will differ from project to project. For instance the purchase of land for €100 million as part of a bigger infrastructural development would have little or no employment content.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">Consequently, it is not possible to give a broad rule of thumb other than to note that €100 million of gross infrastructural investment accounts for 0.05% of GDP.</p>

The 2009 Budget allocated €8.231 billion in Exchequer capital for 2009 and the recent Government decision to reduce this by €300m still leaves the capital allocation for 2009 at €7.931 billion or 5.3% of GNP, one of the highest in the EU.

            <p eId="para_1720">It is estimated that the annual cost of increments for the areas covered by the public service pay bill is of the order of €250m.  No provision is made in the annual Estimates for increments on the basis that the additional cost is generally offset by other staff movements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">In assessing the effect of suspending increments, it is important to understand that not all public servants receive increments. Incremental progression is a system which is not unique to the public service, whereby persons in a number of grades move gradually to the maximum pay of the grade subject to satisfactory performance.  Once the maximum pay has been reached, no further incremental payments are made. Suspending increments would, therefore, affect some public servants but would have no effect on others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">Generally, incremental scales are longer for lower grades than for higher grades. Accordingly a higher proportion of staff in lower grades would be affected by a suspension of increments. Most of the highest paid grades in the public service, i.e. the heads of organisations, do not receive increments as their salaries are single points.</p>

The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that the numbers in different bands will vary from time to time depending on matters such as incremental movement, retirements, the incidence of payment of overtime and allowances to medical staff and the impact of the European Working Time Directive.  In addition, the final uptake of the various contract types among medical consultants can only be estimated at this stage.

            <p eId="para_1742">I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 to 151, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">It is assumed that the income tax rate changes the Deputy has in mind is the replacement of the existing higher and standard rates of 41% and 20% by rates of 43% and 22% and of 45% and 23%, respectively and a reduction in the personal and employee tax credits to €1,150 in both cases.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2009 incomes, of the changes mentioned by the Deputy would be of the order of €4.25 billion for rates 43% and 22% and €5.25 billion for rates of 45% and 23% including the reduction in personal and employee tax credits in both cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">With regard to the abolition of mortgage interest relief for first time buyers and other home owners I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2009, would be of the order of €560 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for the year 2007, the estimated amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against rents assessable under Case V, Schedule D is of the order of €880 million. This estimate is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.  The nominal yield of €880 million to the Exchequer from abolition of the relief may not be immediate depending on whether there is sufficient taxable rental income in the year of abolition to absorb it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">Finally, in relation to the abolition of the employee tax credit I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2009 incomes, would be of the order of €2.9 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">The Addendum to the Stability Programme Update was published on 9 January 2009 and was based on the available information at the end of 2008.  The taxation and expenditure projections supplied in the Addendum are a technical representation of what is required at a macro level to achieve the overall fiscal adjustments over the period to 2013.  The actual detailed composition of the tax and expenditure measures within the macro framework is a matter for policy decision by Government as part of the budgetary process.  Accordingly it is not possible to provide the detailed micro level costings in the manner sought by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1750">I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">The Deputy will be aware the issue of a carbon tax is being considered by the Commission on Taxation. The Commission is due to report by September 2009 at the latest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">Given that the precise design of the carbon tax is yet to be determined as well as other factors such as consumer behaviour, it is not possible to accurately predict the revenue. A lot obviously depends on the assumptions underpinning any anticipated yield. For the purpose of this exercise, it is assumed a carbon tax would apply to both commercial and non-commercial use of diesel, petrol, kerosene, gasoil and LPG.  In relation to peat, coal and natural gas, consumption figures (as per SEI Annual Report 2007) for the residential sector alone are used as the majority of commercial consumption of those commodities is used in the production of electricity which is covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Under these assumptions it is estimated that a carbon tax at a rate of €25 per tonne could provide gross yields of approximately €550m per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">A prospective 2009 yield, with an introductory date of 1 April 2009, would need to take account of seasonal factors, the payment arrangements put in place for the tax, and therefore an estimate at this stage would not be reliable. I am not in a position at this time to provide estimates in relation to the years 2010 to 2013, which, in addition to the changes in the carbon tax rates proposed, would inter alia depend on the levels of consumption of the fuels subject to the tax in the years in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1804">As the Deputies are aware, the youth sector has received considerable financial support over the past number of years.  Funding expanded from €35.5m in 2004 to €52m in 2008. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector including the roll out of a number of sections of the Youth Work Act, 2001 and actions cited in the National Youth Work Development Plan, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">It is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget of over €48m will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities. I have met with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), which represents some 50 youth organisations, and am aware of the valuable work carried out by the youth work sector, including its strong volunteer base, both in the particular areas referred to by the Deputies as well as across the country.   I wish to assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to minimise the impact of the reduction in funding available to the youth sector and to preserve and maintain existing provision in so far as is possible.</p>

         the way income is assessed in the means test for the medical card in respect of persons over seventy when the pension has an account that does not accrue for five and a half years and when the pension has an account that accrues every few months but when higher interest will accrue the longer the deposit remains untouched.

            <p eId="para_1841">Under the over 70s medical card scheme, from 1st January 2009 any savings and similar investments up to €36,000 (single)/€72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.  The relevant portion of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate, based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.  The Health Service Executive's (HSE) Central Application Unit will review the notional rate on a quarterly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">Alternatively, where an applicant wishes to have the actual interest from savings/investments considered, then the HSE will apply this approach and use the most beneficial option in favour of the applicant, subject to submission of the appropriate certificates from the relevant institutions.  In the case of "longer term" investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">Income will not be imputed from property (whether a family home, a holiday home or any other property) for means testing purposes, unless it is rented and only the net rental income will be included as income. The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the rental of the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance etc.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1851">The Group to which the Deputy refers is the Association of Occupational Therapists (AOTI), the professional body for occupational therapists in Ireland.  At present there is no system of statutory registration of occupational therapists in Ireland.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (H&amp;SCPC) was established in March 2007, under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, and will provide for the statutory registration of twelve separate health and social care professions including Occupational Therapists. It is currently in start-up mode.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">While registration/membership of the AOTI is a matter for the Association itself, the AOTI provides advice to the Department in relation to the recognition of non-Irish qualifications in occupational therapy and  I presume that the Deputy is referring to the requirement that occupational therapists with non-Irish qualifications  must have, inter alia, completed 250 hours of psycho-social practice education before they can practise in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in a Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications, on either a self-employed or employed basis.  Its intention is to make it easier for qualified health professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than where they have qualified but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">In relation to professional qualifications in occupational therapy, the Directive is transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 139 of 2008 and Statutory Instrument No. 166 of 2008.  The Minister for Health and Children is the competent authority for the assessment of these professional qualifications and the process is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) (National Validation Office (NVO)). The HSE/Minister for Health and Children is advised in this function by the AOTI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">The assessment process is a detailed one, as prescribed in the Directive, in which, on a case-by-case basis, the qualifications of an applicant are assessed against those required to practise in Ireland.  In the case of qualifications in Occupational Therapy, the AOTI has minimum standards for practice education in Ireland which must be met by all occupational therapists qualifying in Ireland and against which non-Irish qualifications are compared.  The requirement of 250 hours of psycho-social placement derives from these standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable, then the qualifications cannot be recognised.    If the activities are comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be and is considered by the AOTI.  If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.   Accordingly and in line with the Directive, appropriate post-qualification professional experience of applicants is taken into account in the assessment of non-Irish qualifications.</p>

The HSE is facing significant financial pressures arising to a large degree from the broader economic situation, in particular such factors as the increase in the number of medical cards issued and lower than expected receipts from the Health Levy.  The HSE Board met last week to consider these issues and the HSE will work with my Department to manage the situation.

Initiatives of this kind can be implemented without affecting the level or quality of services to patients.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian O’Shea</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
         if, in regard to the entitlement of citizens over 70 years of age to a medical card, she will extend the concession whereby widows and widowers whose spouses passed away after 1 January 2009 hold their medical cards irrespective of when their spouse passed away; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1884">The Health Act 2008 allows for a surviving spouse of an over 70 medical card holder to retain their card for a period of 3 years provided that: the death occurred on or after 1st January 2009; the surviving spouse/partner was aged 70 or over at the time of the death; and the surviving spouse remains within the €1,400 weekly income limit for a couple.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">After 3 years, the surviving spouse will be assessed under the €700 single weekly income limit.  I moved an amendment during the legislation's passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that a person aged 70 or over would not lose his/her medical card as an immediate consequence of the death of a spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">My Department examined the options available to ensure that the trauma is minimised for an elderly person whose spouse dies.  I am satisfied that the provision in the legislation offers the best solution from a non-discrimination point of view.  A surviving spouse aged 70 or over, who no longer qualifies for a medical card after 1st January may apply to the HSE for a card under the existing net income thresholds, which take account of medical, nursing and other relevant expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">The HSE may also issue a medical card on a discretionary basis if the person would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for themselves and any dependants.  Such persons are encouraged to apply to the HSE for a discretionary card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">I am satisfied that the arrangements outlined above are equitable and there are no plans to amend the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1965">I understand that in 2007 the number of prescriptions presented under the GMS scheme was 14.8 million and the number of items dispensed was 44m.  On that basis, a simple €10 charge per prescription would raise €148m and a €10 charge per item would raise €440m.  This figure should be treated with extreme caution as the actual amount that might be collected depends on a number of variables, for example, whether the co-payment would apply per item, per prescription, per person or per family; whether a charge less than the maximum would be payable; and whether any exemptions would apply.  The proposed method of collection may also be relevant as an administrative cost.  If the Deputy would like to specify in more detail the type of co-payment rules he has in mind, I would  be pleased to have his proposals costed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1967">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has the operational and funding responsibility for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, which includes the medical card and GP visit card benefits.  Most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE show there were 1,352,120 medical card holders as at 1st January 2009.    Some 2,100 General Practitioners (GPs) have contracts with the HSE for the provision of services under the GMS Scheme.  Over 99% of these GPs hold the 1989 Capitation contract, under which the GP is paid a set fee each year for each person on his/her GMS panel.  The fee varies for cardholders depending on their age, gender and distance of their residence from the GP's surgery.  The number of visits by a patient to a GP each year does not affect the capitation fee.  The HSE does not record the number of visits by GMS patients to GPs as such statistics are not required in assessing the annual capitation fee paid to the GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Household Survey for the third quarter in 2007 (as published in October 2008) shows the average number of GP visits per GMS patient is 5.2 visits per year.  On this basis, the introduction of a €10 monthly co-payment for GP visits would yield €70.3m.  However this figure should be treated with extreme caution as the actual amount that might be collected depends on a number of variables, for example, the frequency distribution of such visits (whether distributed evenly across the year or concentrated in particular months), whether the €10 monthly limit applied to each medical card holder or to each family group, and whether capitation payments to general practitioners were to be reduced to reflect the co-payments.  If the Deputy would like to specify in more detail the type of co-payment rules he has in mind, I would  be pleased to have his proposals costed.</p>

In the case of regional and local roads, the position is that provision, improvement and maintenance of such roads in its area is a statutory function of each individual road authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The specification for roadworks is set out in the NRA's Manual of Contract Documents which specifies the appropriate National and European standards for roadworks.

            <p eId="para_1980">A review of Ireland's preparedness and capacity to respond to ship-sourced pollution has been taking place over recent months and is almost complete. Recent events will be taken into account in determining future strategy in this area. I am satisfied with the action taken to date. The incident highlights the constant need for our Coast Guard and harbour and local authorities to be ready to respond to maritime incidents. I also want to acknowledge the national and international cooperation, which assisted in dealing with this incident to date. As I have stated, the Coast Guard was able to call on many state agencies in co-ordinating an effective response. Furthermore, the nature of the response and degree of support from UK Coastguard was much appreciated. I want to place on the record my particular appreciation and recognition of the part the European Maritime Safety Agency plays in this area and their specific role in this case.</p>

At their meeting on 26 February 2009, EU Justice Ministers adopted a Framework Decision on the organisation and content for the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States.  This will enhance the exchange of information on convictions within the European mutual assistance framework and where such information is made available to the Garda Síochána it will be entered on the Garda criminal records database and will be available for vetting purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2061">Eurojust is a high-level team of prosecutors — seconded from each EU Member State — based in The Hague. Eurojust can give immediate legal advice and assistance in cross-border cases to investigators, prosecutors and judges in Member States.

            <p eId="para_2062">Ireland is fully supportive of Eurojust and actively engaged in its work. In addition to seeking and providing assistance, the information we are privy to by virtue of our involvement in Eurojust is of use and relevance to us.

            <p eId="para_2063">The Council Decision on the strengthening of Eurojust was adopted by the Council of Ministers at the meeting of 16/17 December 2008.

            <p eId="para_2066">The Office for Internet Safety (OIS) has been established as an executive office within my Department and has taken over the formal role of the Internet Advisory Board in terms of monitoring industry self-regulation in relation to illegal content on the internet.  This is an important step in building the best possible protection for the community at large, and in particular for children, from the downside of the internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">The EU has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful use of the internet to date and the Office for Internet Safety is closely involved in this work. In January 1999 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the Action Plan on promoting safe use of the Internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks. By force of this document the European Commission launched a new programme — Safer Internet Action Plan (SIAP) — to promote safe use of the Internet and other new technologies, including the new generation of mobile phones, online games, chatrooms, and instant messaging software.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">The first edition of the Safer Internet Programme ran from 1999-2002. During this period 37 projects across the EU were co-funded under the programme, which was further extended to cover the period 2003-2004 with another 52 projects financed. The second edition of the Safer Internet Programme took place between 2005-2008. The third edition of the programme approved by the Council of the European Union in December 2008 is scheduled to run from 2009-2013 and will have the overall aim of supporting safer use of internet technologies, especially for children. The Office for Internet Safety was actively engaged in providing input into the development of the proposal from an Irish perspective. The Office is also represented on the EU's Management Committee for the Safer Internet Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">The Safer Internet Ireland (SII) project is the current Irish project funded under the Safer Internet Programme and comprises a consortium of industry, education, child welfare and government partners to provide Safer Internet awareness campaigns, hotline and helpline functions and other related activities for the Republic of Ireland. The project is coordinated by the OIS to develop national initiatives promoting the safer use of electronic media and enhance protection of the vulnerable, particularly children, against the downside of the Internet. This consortium builds on the experience gained from the previous highly successful but independently run Safer Internet projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">In addition, the Office for Internet Safety actively participates in EU activities which seek to promote internet safety, including the annual EU Safer Internet Forum and EU Safer Internet Day. Safer Internet Day 2009 took place on 10 February 2009. To mark the day, the Office produced an information leaflet for parents on Internet Safety and a bookmark for children with "Top Tips for Safer Use of Social-Networking Sites". In conjunction with its partners in the Safer Internet Ireland project, the Office was involved in the launch of a new video campaign "Watch Your Space — Stop Cyberbullying" which is currently running on a number of television channels and online media in Ireland. The Office for Internet Safety will continue to work closely with its EU counterparts to ensure the ongoing promotion of the internet safety agenda. Further information on the activities of the Office for Internet Safety is available on its website www.internetsafety.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_2086">The group last met on 20 June 2008.  A further meeting is to take place in the coming months to review developments during the period from October 2007 to October 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">The Group agreed at its meeting in June 2008 that each of the participating countries would run an awareness raising campaign in their country based on the Blue Blindfold concept which has as its message 'Don't Close your Eyes to Human Trafficking'.  The Irish campaign was launched by the Garda Commissioner and I on 21 October, 2008 and ran for 3 weeks.  It was designed to raise awareness of the problem of human trafficking with the public and law enforcement agencies and to discourage demand for the services of victims of exploitation.  It included newspaper advertisements at the start and the end of the campaign, a wide distribution of posters, leaflets and business cards (to Garda Stations, Libraries, Health Centres, Hospitals, Reception and Integration Agency centres, etc), advertisements on the Luas and on the RTE website, advertisements in sporting programmes/magazines, a 12 hour hotline manned by members of An Garda Síochána and the development of a website — www.blueblindfold.gov.ie.  The UK have conducted a number of awareness raising campaigns based on the Blue Blindfold concept (which they originally developed).  Poland ran an awareness raising campaign on labour exploitation which aimed at targeting its young population who are emigrating abroad for employment.  Italy will commence its awareness raising campaign on 6 March, 2009 aimed at the public and based on the blue blindfold concept.  Information on campaigns in Spain and the Netherlands are not available at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">As part of the enhanced law enforcement activity during the period of the initiative Ireland placed a particular focus on the trafficking of children and launched Operation 'Snow' which was designed:</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">to prevent the trafficking and smuggling of minors into, out of and within the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">to ensure the welfare of suspected victims of such criminal activity was adequately provided for and</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">to achieve prosecutions where criminality activity of the nature concerned has been detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">As part of this initiative the Garda National Immigration Bureau encouraged increased vigilance by members of An Garda Síochána who are engaged in the immigration process, in particular with regard to the movement of minors into and out of the State, in an effort to discover children who may be victims of human trafficking or smuggling or illegal immigrants.  In so doing it is recognised that discovering a child who is a victim of human trafficking at the time he/she enters the State may represent his/her only opportunity to avoid the exploitation the traffickers involved have planned for him/her.  Enforcing the relevant provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Childcare Act, 2001 in respect of minors arriving in the State at Ports of Entry, has proved particularly important in offering protection to minors suspected to be victims of human trafficking or smuggling of illegal immigrants.</p>

            <p eId="para_2097">Operation ‘Pentameter 2' was a UK initiative which concluded in 2008.The primary aim of the initiative was to ensure a coordinated approach to the phenomenon of human trafficking across all police forces and other Crown agencies, such as the UK Border and Immigration Service, in the UK. An Garda Síochána participated in the initiative as a result of the need to have a coordinated approach to human trafficking within the Common Travel Area, which operates between the UK and Ireland. This cooperation took the form of intelligence sharing; joint training exercises and operational cooperation where investigations had a cross-border (Ireland / UK) dimension.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">Poster Campaigns were undertaken as part of Operation Pentameter I and 2. This material was also utilised in joint initiatives with Ireland launched in May 2006 and in October, 2008. Pentameter 2 was linked to activity taking place under the G6 Initiative involving six countries — namely the United Kingdom, Poland, Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Ireland with support from Europol, Interpol and Eurojust. The G6 Awareness Raising strand of activity led by Ireland adopted the ‘Blue Blindfold — Don't close your eyes to human trafficking'' concept as a common symbol that could be used in the other countries as well as in the UK. 'Blue Blindfold' was developed by the UK Human Trafficking Centre during Operation Pentameter. The Irish 'Blue Blindfold' awareness raising campaign was launched by the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána and I on 21 October 2008 and ran for three weeks.  It was designed to raise awareness of the problem of human trafficking with the public and law enforcement agencies and to discourage demand for the services of victims of exploitation.  It included newspaper advertisements at the start and the end of the campaign, a wide distribution of posters, leaflets and business cards (to Garda Stations, Libraries, Health Centres, Hospitals, Reception and Integration Agency centres, etc), advertisements on the Luas and on the RTE website, advertisements in sporting programmes/magazines, a 12 hour hotline manned by members of An Garda Síochána and the development of a website —<i>www.blueblindfold.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2290">Abdullah Öcalan has been held in solitary confinement since his arrest on 15 February 1999. The tenth anniversary of his arrest was marked by disturbances in a number of Turkish towns, mainly in the Kurdish areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2291">Mr. Öcalan remains the only person detained in the Imrali Island prison near Istanbul. During a visit to the prison in May 2007, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), an arm of the Council of Europe, strongly criticised his conditions of detention, and called on the Turkish authorities to "completely review the situation, with a view to integrating him into a setting where contacts with other inmates and a wider range of activities are possible." The CPT is due to carry out a further visit to Turkey in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2292">In November 2008, the Turkish Justice Minister confirmed that a new prison facility was being constructed on Imrali with a view to transferring a small number of other prisoners to the island and ending Mr Öcalan's isolation. However, no more details of the government's decision have been made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2293">The Embassy in Ankara and the Permanent Representation to the Council of Europe will continue to monitor developments in this case.  The Turkish authorities are facing a serious terrorist threat from the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which is included by the EU in its list of terrorist organisations.  One of the key elements of the EU's enlargement negotiations with Turkey is to ensure that legitimate anti-terrorism and security measures do not undermine full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. Ireland, together with its EU partners, will also continue to urge Turkey to implement further reforms which are needed to ensure greater recognition of the rights and cultural identity of the Kurdish minority. The present Turkish government has declared its commitment to tackling the social, political and cultural issues that surround the Kurdish issue in Turkey and it is important that it act in accordance with that commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2295">The Government decision to reduce the budget provided for Overseas Development Assistance was taken solely in the context of the extremely difficult economic situation the country now faces. I have already given a clear commitment that when economic circumstances permit, we will resume the expansion in Ireland's aid programme which has been a significant feature of Government policy over the past decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">It is important to recognise that, even with the reduction in our aid programme from the planned €891 million to €796 million, Ireland will again this year be the world's sixth largest aid donor, in per capita terms. Our aid programme is recognised internationally for providing untied aid, with a particularly strong focus on the poorest and most vulnerable people in sub-Saharan Africa. The Government is continuing to work to achieve the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">I am fully aware of the concerns of Non Governmental Organisations and others about the Government decision. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have held meetings with representatives of the Irish NGOs to discuss these concerns. As we have done in our public statements, we have explained the basis on which the Government decision was taken and underlined our strong commitment to working with the Governments and people of the developing world, in cooperation with our EU and other international partners, to ensure that the poorest people do not become the chief victims of the global economic crisis. I have also emphasised the importance which we attach to our partnership with NGOs and civil society, through which over 20% of the budget for development assistance is being channelled. I have made clear that the priorities of the aid programme will remain as set out in the Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">We are now examining carefully how the budget adjustment of €95 million will be implemented across the aid programme. The decisions we make will be based on a comprehensive analysis of the programme, to ensure its effectiveness and value for money. They will be based on a firm commitment to maintaining the central priority of Ireland's development programme: to contribute to the reduction of global poverty and hunger, with a particular focus on the poorest people in the Least Developed Countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2300">Lesotho is one of the nine priority countries for Ireland's aid programme. We have been working with the Government and people of Lesotho since 1975, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance. Lesotho is one of the world's poorest countries. Almost 25% of the adult population are living with HIV and AIDS, and life expectancy is only 42.6 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">Ireland's bilateral aid programme in Lesotho amounted to over €13 million last year. In addition, over €150,000 was provided during 2008 to support the work of Irish Non Governmental Organisations, missionaries and UN Volunteers in Lesotho.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">Since its inception, Ireland's aid programme has been directed primarily at rural communities located in the remote mountain districts of the country where poverty levels are highest. We have focused on the provision of health and education services. The fight against HIV and AIDS is now also a particular priority for the programme. We are contributing through an important tripartite partnership between Irish Aid, the Clinton Foundation and the Lesotho Ministry of Health. €4 million was provided from the programme budget for the partnership last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">Overall, a recent review of assistance to Lesotho has shown that the efforts of donors are being hampered by a lack of human resource capacity, weak planning in the country's public services, the effects of the HIV and AIDS pandemic and the continuing migration of labour to South Africa and elsewhere. In recognition of this, the Irish Aid Country Strategy Programme for Lesotho for the period 2008 — 2012 is based on a focused "whole of government" approach, with the objective of improving the effectiveness of aid and achieving specific social outcomes.</p>

We do not yet know if Mr. Netanyahu will succeed in forming a coalition, though any such coalition is increasingly likely to be a narrow one formed with nationalist and religious parties on the right of the political spectrum, rather than a broader centrist coalition. The precise programme of any new Israeli government also remains to be outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">While I have spoken directly and strongly in criticism of Israel's actions in the recent Gaza conflict, and in regard to settlement activity on the West Bank, I have also made it clear at all times that I regard dialogue and engagement as the only way forward. I would hope to engage constructively with the new Israeli Government, both bilaterally and in concert with our EU partners, in this spirit, just as I have done with the outgoing Government. I would assure Israelis, and the Israeli Government, that Ireland will continue to seek to assist all sides in reaching a comprehensive peace settlement. I would also encourage them to commit themselves to honouring existing commitments and to build on the progress that was made last year, before the Gaza operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2311">The agreement between the Governments of Ireland and Belarus signed in Minsk on 23 February concerns the conditions under which children from Belarus may come to Ireland for the purposes of recuperation. I am delighted that this will enable the many Irish charities involved to continue their important and ongoing contribution to assisting Chernobyl children to visit Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">Following the failure of a Belorussian child to return from a visit to the US, in August Belarus proposed to all countries receiving children from it, including Ireland, formal agreements aimed at securing the welfare of the children and ensuring their return to Belarus. It indicated that, pending the conclusion of such agreements, visits by children would be suspended. A Presidential decree also imposed certain restrictions regarding the age at which children could travel, and the number of visits to any one country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">I moved immediately to open negotiations with the Belorussian authorities to resolve these issues. In October I met the Belorussian Foreign Minister. Officials from my Department and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, working with our Embassy in Moscow, were involved in intensive contacts with the Belorussian authorities and in the drafting of an acceptable text. On 8 December, an Irish delegation visited Minsk and successfully concluded negotiations on the agreement, subject to later signature. Following this, Belarus confirmed that children would be allowed to travel over the Christmas period, and these visits proceeded as normal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">The agreement will permit the children's visits to continue, in accordance with our domestic law and relevant international conventions. Importantly, it ensures that the restrictions imposed by the Presidential decree were lifted insofar as Ireland is concerned. I am pleased that this matter has been brought to a successful conclusion and that any doubt there may have been over future visits by Chernobyl children to Ireland have been removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">I am arranging for a copy of the Agreement to be deposited in the Dáil Library, and will send a copy directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2346">Ireland intends to participate in the Durban II Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance which is scheduled to take place in Geneva from 20 to 24 April 2009. The original Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was adopted in 2001. Ireland has participated in the Preparatory Conferences and the recent Intersessional Working Group Meetings for the Durban II Conference which have been taking place in Geneva. The negotiation of the final document for the Conference started at the end of January 2009. Time is therefore short before the Durban II Conference takes place and many difficult issues are still under discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">Ireland and our EU partners are of the view that the broad consensus eventually achieved in Durban in 2001 has to be preserved. The EU is, therefore, concerned at certain developments in the process to date, and especially at the attempts of some delegations to introduce controversial and divisive issues and language that would divert the focus of the Durban II Conference away from the very real problems of racism and discrimination. This would indeed place the success of the Conference in serious jeopardy. Hence, we and our EU partners have made clear that it would not be able to subscribe to an outcome which would seek to limit or undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms or dilute the focus on racism and discrimination. Ireland and our EU partners are committed, however, to remaining engaged in this process as long as there is a reasonable prospect that the final document respects its position. A final document of a concise nature would serve to underline the character of the Durban II Conference as a review of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and would certainly appear more likely to achieve consensus.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">I am aware that on 23 January 2008 Canada stated that it would not participate in the Durban II Conference. Canada said that the 2001 Conference had "degenerated into open and divisive expressions of intolerance and anti-Semitism that undermined the principles of the United Nations and the very goals the Conference sought to achieve". Canada also indicated that "it had hoped the preparatory process for the 2009 Durban Review Conference would remedy the mistakes of the past" but had concluded the process was too flawed to make the Conference worthwhile.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">While I acknowledge the concerns that have led to the Canadian decision, I continue to believe that the Durban process is worthwhile and that the preferable course of action is to work within the process with a view to achieving an acceptable outcome document at the Durban II Conference. This view is shared by EU partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2375">I assume the Deputy is referring to proposed expenditure and allocations under the sports capital programme in 2009.  Under the programme, which is administered by my Department and part funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998, over €725 million has been allocated to over 7,400 projects across the country.  In the 2009 Estimates, €56 million has been provided in my Department's vote to cover payments to be made in respect of projects which have been awarded grants in the period up to and including 2008.  The level of payments under the programme in any given year is a function of the number of valid claims submitted in respect of outstanding allocations which comply with the terms and conditions of the programme. While the level of expenditure in 2009 which will relate to a particular county, cannot be anticipated at this point, all funding available this year will be fully expended.</p>

            <p eId="para_2384">Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department and part funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998, over €725 million has been allocated to over 7,400 projects across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">As I announced in the House recently, no decision has been taken about the timing of future rounds of the Programme.  My Department is currently finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the country. The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy also identifies the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact in the relevant areas including those in lower socioeconomic groups.  The National Sports Facilities Strategy will address future sports facility funding and provision and will inform future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">In the 2009 Estimates, €56m has been provided in my Department's vote to cover payments to be made this year from the C-1 sub-head, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation.  Expenditure under this sub-head amounted to €63.7m in 2007 and €60.1m in 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_750">
            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2389">I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 289 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">I, and my officials, are in regular contact with representatives of the tourism industry, including the representative groups of accommodation providers and the catering sector.  Amongst the groups I have met since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism are the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC), the Irish Tour Operators Association (ITOA), the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), the Irish Self Catering Federation (ISCF), the Town &amp; Country Homes and Irish Farm Holidays associations as well as Good Food Ireland.  As a result, I am well aware of the difficulties being experienced by hoteliers, other accommodation providers and catering operators in the new economic conditions in which we find ourselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">Indeed, as recently as yesterday I met with the President, Chief Executive and other officials of the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) and addressed their Annual Conference in Killarney.  In my address to the IHF Conference I outlined the key tourism strategies being pursued by my Department and the tourism agencies during 2009.  In particular, since taking office I have been anxious to protect our marketing spend. Notwithstanding substantial pressures on the Department's budget, I have been successful in preserving the 2009 Tourism Marketing Fund allocation of €48.5million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">This has enabled Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to maintain their frontline marketing activities this year.  Tourism Ireland is working aggressively in all our major markets, communicating strong reasons to visit Ireland together with clear price-led messages.  On the home market, Fáilte Ireland is working hard to persuade Irish people to take a break at home this year.  In my view, the primary means at our disposal to address the difficulties being experienced by hotels and catering operators is to maintain the marketing effort and to ensure the provision of a competitive and quality product offering to visitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2393">In addition to marketing supports, Fáilte Ireland has also refocused its programmes to meet the enterprise support needs of businesses in the tourism sector in the current difficult climate.  In 2009 they will be investing almost €6 million in the form of direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">The key elements of its support package in 2009 will include :</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">a new mentoring support service providing one-to-one advice,</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">a new "Biz-Check" service designed to provide operators with on-site business diagnosis and solutions support,</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">a further expansion of the "e-Biz" initiative to improve on-line marketing and e-business skills generally within the industry,</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">a significant investment in on-site training of industry employees in customer care and food preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">Fáilte Ireland, at its recent industry roadshow events and subsequent mentoring meetings has gone out to the industry and advised them of the support and assistance it has to offer and to date it has been very pleased with the positive reaction and level of engagement it has received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">I am aware that labour represents a significant proportion of hotel and catering establishment costs.  I have been in regular contact with the Tánaiste on the issue of wage costs and industrial relations structures, in particular as regards the issue of double-time payments on Sunday.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">I am also conscious of the impact of the regulatory framework and the various local authority charges on the hotel and catering sector.  I am aware that the Commission on Taxation is examining funding of Local Authorities and my Department has stressed to the Commission that there is a need for broad based funding of local authorities that should not unreasonably discriminate between economic sectors.  I have strongly advised the industry to engage directly with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">While I recognise that local authorities must be able to raise revenue in order to fulfil their mandates, I am anxious to avoid charges that could have a detrimental effect on the competitiveness and performance of the tourism industry. Accordingly, my officials and I have recently expressed concerns to the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his officials in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2404">Despite an extremely challenging global economic environment, final year figures for 2008, which were recently published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), show that Ireland's visitor numbers held up well, making a vital contribution to employment, export earnings and tax receipts in our economy. Almost eight million overseas visitors came to Ireland in 2008 representing the second highest yearly figure ever recorded and a very slight reduction of 2.2% on the record levels of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">The 2009 business plans for the key tourism agencies, Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland, are designed to support the marketing of Irish tourism, to improve our product offerings and to help improve business capability.  These are being supported by the positive response of the tourism sector at enterprise level to the challenges we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">While I know that our businesses and tourism agencies are responding constructively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  Accordingly, I established the Tourism Renewal Group, which has been tasked with reviewing and, where appropriate, renewing the current tourism strategy, set out in the "New Horizons" report, in order to ensure that this strategy is focused for the short term and that the tourist industry is well placed to benefit from the upturn when it comes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">The Group's work is ongoing and I have asked them to report back to me by the middle of 2009, following its considerations, with recommendations in the form of a Framework for Action.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">Furthermore, one of my priorities as Minister is to ensure that the tourism agenda is accommodated in all the relevant policies and programmes that impact on tourism.  This is being put into practice on an ongoing basis by my Department and the tourism agencies through engagement with the relevant Departments and agencies on their policies and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">I am confident that, in partnership with the sector, we can plan for current and future challenges and take appropriate action to meet them, thereby ensuring that Irish tourism continues on a path of sustainable growth over the medium term.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2426">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section — http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID — and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  In 2007 I agreed to co-fund the provision of facilities in schools located in, or mainly servicing children from, RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2428">€6.09m has been allocated in Budget 2009 for the RAPID leverage schemes.   I am satisfied that this year's allocation will be sufficient to enable further good progress to be made with small-scale co-funded projects in RAPID areas in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2429">However, given that the RAPID Leverage Scheme is a demand-led, bottom-up funding programme, it is not possible to predict accurately the extent of claims that will be lodged by RAPID areas in Cork East during the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">There are two RAPID areas in the Cork East, the towns of Mallow and Youghal. Details of projects supported in these areas under the Leverage Schemes since 2004 are outlined as follows.</p>

            <p eId="para_2773">Statutory responsibility for the administration of Civil Registration in Ireland rests with an tArd-Chlaraitheoir (Registrar General).  His Office, the General Register Office (GRO) is the central repository for records of life events occurring in the State, e.g. births, deaths, marriages, stillbirths and domestic adoptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">I have made enquiries of an tArd-Chlaraitheoir regarding the matter raised by the Deputy and the position is as set out below.  The statutes governing the administration of Civil Registration provide that any person, following an application in writing to an tArd-Chlaraitheoir, to a Superintendent Registrar, a registrar or to an authorised officer may, on payment by that person of the prescribed fee(s), search the indexes to the registers and be provided with a certified copy or copy of any entry or entries specified by the person arising from the search.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">The statutes also provide that an tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, a Superintendent Registrar, a registrar or an authorised officer shall, following an application in writing from a person and on payment by that person of the prescribed fee(s), undertake searches of the registers and the indices thereto on behalf of that person for an entry or entries specified by the person, and may provide him/her with a certified copy or copy of any entry or entries so specified.  The person must furnish sufficient information to enable the record s/he requires to be identified from the indexes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">The statutes do not provide for direct access to the registers by any person other than an tArd-Chláraitheoir, a Superintendent Registrar, a registrar or an authorised officer.  A dedicated genealogical research facility is provided by the Civil Registration Service and is located at the Irish Life Centre, Lr Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of registration services through a network of 62 local registration offices across the State managed by Superintendent Registrars.  Records relating to access to indexes held by the local registrars are not routinely maintained by the GRO.  An tArd Chlaraitheoir has undertaken to make enquiries of the Superintendent Registrars relating to access to records locally.  As soon as this information is to hand, he will contact the Deputy direct with the information she requires.</p>

            <p eId="para_2781">Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66 years. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical examination and a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">The weekly rate of Disability Allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.  Means are assessed on the claimant's own means and that of their spouse/partner subject to certain exceptions laid down in legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on the 12 October 2007 and was awarded Disability Allowance with effect from 17 October 2007. He was assessed with means derived from his Social Security payment from England.  The current weekly rate of Disability Allowance payable to the person concerned is €34.30 basic rate, a Living Alone Increase of €7.70 and a Free Fuel Allowance of €20.00. The total weekly Disability Allowance payment to this person is €62.00.</p>

            <p eId="para_2787">One of the qualifying conditions for jobseeker's benefit and allowance is that a person must be unemployed, available for full-time employment and genuinely looking for work.  Therefore, a day on which a person works, even if they are working for free, is not a day of unemployment.  In this context "employed" means engaging in work that is paid work or is ordinarily paid work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">There is, however, a Voluntary Work Option available to jobseeker's.  Under this option a person who engages in voluntary work within the state may continue to be entitled to jobseeker's benefit or allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the person continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">The voluntary groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups.  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseeker's may engage include helping the sick, elderly or persons with disabilities assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely — to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseeker's to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseeker's of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">In general, a person would not be permitted to avail of the voluntary work option where they would be doing the same work as a person who was being paid.  The voluntary work would normally involve only a few hours a day or a few days a week but full-time involvement in voluntary activities would not necessarily be ruled out.  However, there should be no implication of Job Replacement.  Any reimbursement should generally be limited to out-of-pocket expenses such as travelling expenses.</p>

            <p eId="para_2799">The total capital of the person concerned was calculated at €152,620.30 which arose from the sale of his house. Under Social Welfare legislation the weekly value of capital is assessed as follows. The first €50,000 is disregarded. The next   €10,000 is assessed at €1.00 per €1,000.00 giving weekly means of €10, the next €10,000 is assessed at €2.00 per €1,000.00, giving weekly means of €20.00. The balance, which in this case was €82,000, is assessed at €4.00 per €1,000.00. He was assessed with total weekly means of €358.00 derived from his capital. As this was higher than the then statutory limit of €185 per week for payment of Disability Allowance he was refused.</p>

            <p eId="para_2804">No decisions have been made to change the conditions associated with carer's allowance or any of the 50 or so schemes administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2807">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. The rate of the respite care grant has also bee n increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">In Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week. These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.  It is estimated that combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant will be €643 million in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2810">The case reported on by the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) involves a couple who were over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced and who could not, therefore, satisfy one of the basic requirements for pension as they did not commence paying insurance 10 years before pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2811">A special pension paid at half the personal rate and requiring the payment of at least 260 contributions was introduced in 1999 to cater for such people. The IHRC recommended that a reduced benefit should also be paid to people who, because of advanced age, could not satisfy the conditions for this special pension. This would be a significant departure from the principles underpinning qualification for pensions, and other benefits, which require that a minimum level of contributions should be made before a person can qualify for a payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2812">The IHRC laid particular emphasis on Article 29, paragraph 5, of the European Code of Social Security which deals with the position of people who cannot satisfy new conditions because of advanced age when these are introduced. In the context of submitting its annual report on compliance with the Code, the Department sought the views of the ILO Committee of Experts, which examines national reports on compliance with the European Code of Social Security on behalf of the Council of Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2813">The final resolution on the Department's 2006/2007 compliance report from the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers found that "law and practice in Ireland continue to give full effect to the parts of the Code which have been accepted."</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">In November 2008, the IHRC sought a response regarding the extent to which the recommendations in the IHRC report have been implemented, including by reference to two other human rights standards mentioned in the report — Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), when read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1, and Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_2815">The Department wrote to IHRC in January 2009, expressing the opinion that the Department was not in breach of Article 1 of Protocol 1. In relation to Article 14 of the ECHR, the Department stated that it did not consider that the current jurisprudence of the ECHR indicated that the measures concerned constitute a difference of treatment on a prohibited ground, that it pursued a legitimate aim and that its policies are proportionate to that aim. The Department also indicated that its policies met with the criteria of Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The IHRC responded in February 2009, expressing its gratitude for the Department's ongoing engagement with this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2817">The habitual residence condition applies to all claimants for jobseeker's allowance, regardless of nationality.  A person who is not habitually resident, whether an Irish national, an EU national or a national of another State, is not entitled to receive payment of this allowance.  A detailed questionnaire is issued for completion in every case where the initial claim form does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">The EU Regulations dealing with freedom of movement and the social protection of migrant workers provide certain exceptions which override national legislation.  For instance, family benefits (including child benefit) are payable by the State in which the claimant is employed, or by the State which is paying jobseeker's benefit following a period of employment in that State.  Also an EU national who has worked in Ireland may receive supplementary welfare allowance for a period subject to certain conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">However, these exceptions do not apply to jobseeker's allowance.  The relevant EU Regulations specifically provide for a category of special non-contributory cash benefits which shall be paid only in the State of residence by the institution of the place of residence.  In this Regulation "residence" is defined as "habitual residence" and jobseeker's allowance is specified as one of these benefits.  The application of this condition to this allowance is therefore in full accord with the EU Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2821">Self-employed persons pay a modified rate of PRSI contribution (Class S). These contributions provide cover for long-term pensions such as state pension and widow's/widower's contributory pension.  However they do not provide cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker's and illness benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2822">In certain cases, a self-employed person who had insurable employment in the relevant year (currently 2007) and has sufficient PRSI contribution paid at the appropriate class s/he may qualify for a jobseeker's benefit payment provided all the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">A self-employed person who has insufficient PRSI contributions paid may qualify for a jobseeker's allowance which is a means tested payment.  Generally, in assessing the means of a self-employed person, a Social Welfare Inspector will take into account the level of earnings in the preceding 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year.  However, with the general downturn in the economy at present, it is accepted that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year. The Social Welfare Inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2824">The means test also involves an assessment of the person's savings and investments, any property they may own, apart from the family home and any other income such as a pension from a former employer or from another country.  If the weekly means assessed are less than the appropriate rate for the jobseeker's allowance scheme, the person will qualify for a payment regardless of the number of days worked in any week.  If the weekly means exceed the appropriate rate, the person will have no entitlement to a payment.</p>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>

Regulations provide that notwithstanding the limitation on the amount of mortgage interest supplement payable, the Executive may award a supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable exceeds such amount as is considered reasonable by the Executive.

            <p eId="para_2840">There has been a substantial increase in the number of people applying for one parent family payment and other social welfare payments in recent months.  As a result there has been an increase in the average time for processing claims.  However, staff in social welfare offices have been working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2841">The average processing times for one parent family applications which were decided between 1st January 2008 and 31st January 2009 in respect of social welfare offices in Navan, Kells and Trim were 15.3 weeks, 12.3 weeks and 12.5 weeks respectively.  The Social Welfare Local Office in Navan is dealing with a very significant increase in the number of persons registering as unemployed as well as an increase in one parent family claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_2842">The Department has put a range of measures in place to speed up claim processing.  Five new staff have been assigned to Navan Local Office since the beginning of the year and a further two temporary clerical officers are to take up duty in the next week.  Temporary staff have been deployed to fill any staff vacancies pending the appointment of permanent staff.  A special team from several other Social Welfare offices was deployed on 14 February 2009 to reduce claim backlogs in Navan Local Office.  A number of Regional Local Office Support Units are being established for the purpose of alleviating backlogs.  Deployment of staff to these units has begun and offices like Navan Local Office will benefit from their assistance in the coming weeks.  All measures to improve processing times are being reviewed on a continuous basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2844">Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A. There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">As the self-employed are not normally insured for jobseeker's benefit, they can instead apply for the jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2846">Jobseeker's allowance is a means-tested payment and in assessing a person's means for the purposes of this allowance account is taken of all income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.  In addition, account is also taken of any property that the person may own, apart from their family home, together with any savings and investments they may have and any other cash income such as a pension from a former employer or from another country.  In Budget 2005,  it was announced that the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes for all social welfare schemes (except supplementary welfare allowance) would be increased, with effect from June 2005, from €12,697.38 to €20,000, an increase of over €7,300. This applies to all capital regardless of where it is or was held, be it in a SSIA, a Credit Union, with An Post or any other account with a bank or other financial institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2847">The back to work allowance (BTWA) scheme is designed to assist and encourage the long term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force. There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work enterprise allowance for the self-employed and the back to work allowance for employees.  These allowances provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments and aim to make the return to work financially attractive and viable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2848">This scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme. People who have been unemployed for a very short time are not the main focus of the schemes. The qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and the changing economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">The Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS to improve the services available for progressing people who are dependant on social welfare progress to education, training and employment in the context of the changed economic circumstances.</p>

If they have no entitlement to payment of wages from their employer during school breaks then they are regarded as unemployed during those periods.   As such, they are entitled to make a claim for jobseeker's benefit or allowance. It is not simply a question of signing on to avoid a break in their PRSI record.  They are claiming a jobseeker's payment and must satisfy the conditions of the jobseeker schemes just the same as any other jobseeker.

            <p eId="para_2963">Policy matters in relation to the Early Childcare Supplement are a matter for the Minister for the Health and Children in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">The Department of Social and Family Affairs, through the social welfare system, provides significant support to families with children. The Child Benefit programme, which is paid on a universal basis is the main child income support programme. It provides significant levels of support for families with children irrespective of their income or employment status. Improvements in the Child Benefit programme together with other more targeted supports have allowed the rate of poverty for children to fall according to statistics published by the CSO. The consistent poverty rate for children, aged 0 — 17, decreased from 10.3% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2007. The percentage of children ‘at risk of poverty' fell by over two per cent, from 22.3% in 2006 to 19.9% in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2965">The question of paying Child Benefit on a targeted basis has been raised on a number of occasions in the past. However, an estimate of savings which might be expected from a more targeted approach to Child Benefit and child income support in general would require a large number of detailed assumptions in relation to technical and legal issues (such as earnings thresholds, rates of withdrawal etc) or in relation to the very considerable administrative implications of such a proposal. Estimates of second round effects such as impact on labour force participation decisions and on other social welfare benefits would also have to be taken into account for a comprehensive assessment of such a measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2966">The Minister for Finance announced as part of Budget 2009, that he expects the Commission on Taxation to examine options relating to the tax treatment of universal child benefit payments. Pending the Commission report and in the absence of specific proposals, the Department has not estimated savings from such an approach at this time. The Department will, however, work with the Commission in addressing this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2970">The claim for disability allowance, by the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer of the Department on 24 October 2008 following an examination by a Medical Assessor who expressed the opinion that he was medically unsuitable for the allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">He appealed this decision on 10 November 2008 and he was examined by a second Medical Assessor on 16 December 2008 who also expressed the opinion that he was medically unsuitable for disability allowance.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in accordance with the statutory requirements, the Department has asked for the documentation in the case and the Deciding Officer's comments on the grounds of the appeal.  These have been received and the case has been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral appeal hearing, a date for which has not yet been scheduled.</p>
            <p eId="para_2972">As a result of the examinations by the Medical Assessors it was also decided he was no longer entitled to credited contributions on his illness benefit with effect from 17/10/08.  I am further advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that decisions in relation to credited contributions are administrative in nature and do not have a right of appeal.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on Social Welfare entitlements.</p>

When I announced my acceptance of the Board of Coiste an Asgard's unanimous recommendation that a salvage operation should not be pursued, I stated that I had been impressed by the expressions of support for Asgard II and indicated that I am open to considering any realistic and funded proposals from private individuals or groups as to the future of the vessel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3242">I have not yet been approached with any formal proposals from any private individuals or groups in the period since I made that statement. I am aware that there are some individuals who have expressed an interest in contributing to a fund, though it is probably too early to expect such funding to materialise in the absence of any firm proposals from groups or individuals to establish such a fund.  I will consider any realistic proposals submitted to me but I cannot commit public monies to a salvage operation at this time. Obviously, the amount of funding raised would have a major bearing on any decision made in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3244">It is anticipated that Lifford and Rockhill Barracks will be disposed of, taking account of the market conditions, so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure in accordance with Government policy. Significant progress has been achieved over the past decade in re-equipping and developing Defence Forces capabilities, using the proceeds from the sales of surplus properties and we need to ensure that this progress is continued.  Having regard to the investment needs of the Defence Forces and given the current economic circumstances, it is important that my Department realises the full commercial value of the current properties.  As such, it will not be possible to make properties available for use by local voluntary organisations.</p>

Before taking an estate in charge, a planning authority will check that the estate is completed in accordance with the planning permission and, if the planning permission is not fully complied with, should take appropriate enforcement against the developer.

            <p eId="para_3291">Under the Urban and Village Renewal measures of the two Regional Operational Programmes 2000-2006, grant assistance was provided to local authorities for a range of interventions to upgrade the fabric of the built environment in cities, towns and villages. Final funding allocations under this Programme, involved total EU and Exchequer co-financed expenditure of over €158m, and were completed in early 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">Given the necessity to reprioritise expenditure for 2009 the Urban Regeneration Programme for the period to 2013 has been deferred.  Any decision on the implementation of the Programme will be made as part of the estimates/budgetary processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3410">The Government has put in place a range of measures to provide advice and financial supports to households who may experience difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3411">The Mortgage Interest Supplement, administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, provides direct financial assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's sole place of residence. People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can also avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3412">It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early engagement between the borrower and their financial institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3413">The finalised recapitalisation scheme announced on 11 February 2009 includes a new code of conduct for Mortgage Arrears, based on the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears, which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on 27 February 2009. The new Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator.  Under the mortgage arrears code, where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_3414">In addition as part of their recapitalisation scheme, the two banks concerned, AIB and Bank of Ireland, will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing, where the customer continues to co-operate with the bank.</p>

            <p eId="para_3416">Property management companies are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to operate in compliance with company law, which falls under the area of responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  My Department has no function in the provision of advice with regard to these companies. The rights and obligations of property owners in relation to management companies arise from company law provisions and also from private contracts entered into by them in the purchase of their property.  In this regard, the guidance published by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement — Company Law Handbook on Residential Property Owners' Management Companies — provides a useful resource for both directors and members of management companies.  The guidance can be accessed through its website: www.odce.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3417">In addition, the National Consumer Agency has published an information booklet entitled Property Management Companies and You which includes advice on matters such as service charges and management agents.

            <p eId="para_3438">As an independent planning appeals body, An Bord Pleanála has a key role in ensuring that physical developments, in particular major infrastructure projects, respect the principles of sustainable development and are planned in an efficient, fair and open manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3439">Under Section 126 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Board has a statutory objective to determine appeals within 18 weeks.  Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of delays arising from the holding of an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3440">Record levels of case intake over successive years, peaking at nearly 6,700 cases in 2007, have challenged An Bord Pleanála's ability to achieve this statutory objective. According to the Board's annual report for 2007, the 18-week statutory objective was met in 48% of all cases, compared to 52% in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3441">The Board has also assumed significant new functions under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006. This necessitated a review of the Board's operations and significant restructuring leading to the establishment of a dedicated Strategic Infrastructure Division within the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3442">In light of the demands imposed by its heavy caseload and these additional functions, sanction was given in 2007 for an additional 35.5 permanent staff, bringing the total complement to 172.  Board membership has also been increased from 10 to 11, on a temporary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3443">The Board is focused on dealing quickly with the current backlog of cases and achieving compliance with its statutory objective of determining appeals and referrals within a period of 18 weeks, and expects to make significant progress in this regard over 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3444">I am considering a number of initiatives aimed at helping the Board in this regard including legislative changes, in the context of the proposed Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, to facilitate greater overall efficiency in the determination of cases by the Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_3469">I am informed that there is no other published information on wetted areas specifically for the Boyne.  Percentages for individual productive spawning areas are not available for any tributary of the river as the wetted area information in the report is not presented for individual tributaries.  Therefore, the full extent of wetted area of catchment accessible to salmon is used, irrespective of the habitat type present.</p>

            <p eId="para_3491">The HES Scheme has been launched now in order to allow installers who wish to participate in the scheme, to register with SEI.  Registered contractors will be required to sign up to a code of conduct and comply with a range of terms and conditions to ensure the quality of work carried out under the scheme.  They will also have to carry a specified level of insurance and be fully tax compliant.  SEI will be implementing a quality assurance and inspection programme to ensure compliance with these requirements.  Contractors wishing to register with the scheme may contact SEI at 1850 927000 or at hescontractor@sei.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3492">The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners and landlords will be able to apply under the scheme later this month.  In the meantime, homeowners can register their interest with SEI on 1850 927000 or at hes@sei.ie.  Homeowners may arrange to have a building energy rating carried out immediately, if they wish, but this is not a requirement for participation in the scheme.  However, homeowners should not take any action on the other measures until they have received grant approval from SEI.</p>
            <p eId="para_3493">Following completion of any work carried out under the scheme, the homeowner and contractor must sign a "declaration of work completed", which must then be furnished to SEI in order to receive payment of the grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3494">The second element of the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery, the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), is designed to assist private households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of Fuel Allowance, Invalidity or Disability Benefit.  The scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures, including cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  The WHS provides these measures free or at a nominal cost to the householder.</p>
            <p eId="para_3495">I have made available some €20 million to the WHS in 2009.  This greatly increased level of funding is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in this year alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3496">The scheme is now open for applications and there are 20 community based organisations (CBOs) currently delivering the WHS, and this represents just over two-thirds of the country.  Under our initiative to extend the scheme nationwide in 2009, SEI plans to commence the introduction of new CBOs to the scheme from the end of March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3497">A number of improvements to the WHS are gradually being introduced this quarter, including a new free-phone service designed to assist eligible homeowners in identifying their nearest provider.  If outside of current coverage, their details will be recorded and notified as soon as the service becomes available in their area.  In addition, a new website will be launched to allow homeowners, neighbours or relatives find out more information about the WHS and other grant schemes available in their area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3498">Further information on the WHS is available by calling 1800-250204, by emailing warmerhomes@sei.ie or at www.sei.ie/Grants/Warmer<u/>Homes<u/>Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3499">The third element of the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery will involve providing similar energy efficiency upgrade measures in social housing.  Improving the energy efficiency of local authority housing is a key objective for the Government, and to that end, a fund of some €50m has been set aside in 2009 to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive energy efficiency programme.  This programme will include a number of elements including support for the first round of Towards Carbon Neutral and insulation retrofitting projects.  In addition, the funding will be used to assist local authorities in improving the energy rating of dwellings due to be re-let during the year and to advance the overall energy efficiency in apartment complexes.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be making further announcements on this element of the programme in due course.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources  (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_3503">I propose to take Questions Nos. 368, 374 and 375 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3504">The target of European Council Regulation No. 1100/2007, establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel, is commonly misquoted whereby it is claimed that the Regulation only required a reduction of just 40% in the catching of eels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3505">The EU target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that "the objective of each Member State's Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock".</p>
            <p eId="para_3506">The Regulation requires that 4 kg of eels escape to sea for every 10 kg that would have escaped if people didn't kill any or stop any migrating and the number of elvers coming into the water was as high as it ever was.  It is not a 40% reduction in catch, or in the fishery, nor is it that we need only to let 40% of our silver eels escape.</p>
            <p eId="para_3507">Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the draft Eel Management Plan, a number of management measures have been identified as necessary to reach the targets set in the Regulation, including closure of the commercial and recreational fishery from 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3508">The Irish eel fishery harvests approximately 100 tonnes per annum and I understand that there are up to 150 fishermen who hold a maximum of 296 licences, not all of which are actively fished.  Catches have been declining over recent years because of the status of stocks.  Eel fishing is not a full time occupation and it is restricted depending on the type of fish being targeted, to certain months of the year and times of the lunar cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_3509">The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible, which if all measures proposed are adopted and if the EU Member States adopt a similar conservative approach, could be as long as 90 years (i.e. an average of 4 eel generations).  Under the Regulation, all aspects of the Plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  However, when the last 20 years of poor recruitment is taken into account, it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">I am not aware of the content of the plans, as yet largely unpublished, submitted by other Member States in response to their obligations under the EC Regulation.  Over the coming months, these, along with Ireland's draft plan, have to be evaluated by the European Commission as to their adequacy in delivering the objectives of the Eel Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3511">Clearly the status of stocks in other Member States will differ from that of Ireland's, depending on local conditions and therefore their plans may make different recommendations.  All must, however, clearly demonstrate how they would achieve the targets necessary for recovery of the European eel stocks.  Ireland's draft Eel Management Plan relies upon the most up-to-date information available.</p>

            <p eId="para_3585">I understand that it is very difficult to accurately measure mortality rates in glass eels.  Mortality rates of between 50% to 84% for glass eels in estuaries have been reported in a study conducted by Vollestad and Jonsson, which was quoted in the Erne Eel Enhancement Programme report referenced by the Deputy.  It should be noted that the level of mortality may be both time and site specific.  The calculation by the Deputy, in line with his interpretation of the data, would, however, result in a return of 15 tonne of juvenile eels as opposed to the 150 tonne quoted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3586">I have been advised by the Marine Institute that the elver catch at Cathaleens Falls in 2001 included in the agreed data set for the North Western International River Basin District Eel Management Plan amounted to 699 kg as opposed to the 1,536 Kg presented in the Erne report.  Whilst it is accepted that there were increases in the eel catches at Cathaleen Falls from the mid 1990's to 2000 these were at a low level in all but one of the years.  Furthermore, since 2001, the numbers of elvers caught has declined significantly to as low as 33 kg in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3587">Following the commencement of the Erne Eel Enhancement programme in 1997, an extensive programme of elver stocking was carried out throughout the catchment by the Northern Regional Fisheries Board (NRFB) and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland.  Since the completion of this programme in 2001 and with significantly reduced elver catch returns, almost all elvers captured at Cathaleen Falls have been stocked in Lower and Upper Lough Erne in accordance with a stocking protocol agreed between the NRFB and the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure, Northern Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_3594">I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 379 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3595">I am satisfied that the ESB endeavours to comply with its statutory obligations for the conservation and management of the fish stocks on the fisheries owned by the Board.  In the performance of its remit the ESB has complied, where possible, with scientific advice and participated in appropriate research on inland fisheries species, habitats and related matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_3596">The ESB continues to manage its fisheries in spite of some recent significant changes in the equilibrium of the native fish populations and the impact of environmental and other factors on land and at sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_3597">In particular the ESB has been actively involved in the formulation of the National Eel Management Plan, recognising that barriers to migration in river systems are one of the several factors causing the decline in the eel population.  Silver eel escapement at hydro-power stations is seen as critical in the attainment of the recovery of the stock.  One of the four management measures recommended in the draft Eel Management Plan recently submitted to the EU Commission is the mitigation of the impact of hydro-power, including the operation of a comprehensive silver eel "trap and transport" plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">For a number of years ESB have reduced eel mortality on the Shannon by means of "trap and transport" operations at Killaloe, County Limerick, whereby eels are captured for release downstream of the Ardnacrusha dam.  Under the draft Eel Management Plan, ESB have undertaken to address the impact of hydro-stations on eel stocks through similar "trap and transport" operations to be undertaken on the Erne and Lee systems from 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3599">I understand the balloon tag tests referred to by the Deputy were carried out on juvenile Atlantic salmon on the Erne system by the ESB.  There has been no direct measurement of hydro-power mortality for eels in Ireland. Studies, published by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in 2003, have suggested an average mortality rate of 28.5% across all length classes per hydro-power installation.  As part of the draft Eel Management Plan, research will be undertaken to quantify the level of mortality at each power turbine over the period 2009-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3600">I am advised that the ESB, in conjunction with the National University of Ireland, Galway, are currently undertaking telemetry studies of migrating silver eel and plan to test the use of hydro-acoustic technology for deflecting downstream migrating silver eel into the bypass channel on the River Shannon.</p>

         the reason, some years back, the Western Regional Fisheries Board refused to issue eel fishermen with licences and instead issued them to anglers who returned them un-fished; if this was to increase silver eel catches on the Galway weir which the Western Regional Fisheries Board operate and have received hundreds of thousands of euros from the sale of these silver eels to the Dutch dealers with no escapement of breeding stock; if this fishery will be closed or if they are planning another by-law to allow them to continue to fish it; and if he will quantify the mass of eels released from the Corrib fishery under the heading of conservation in the years 2000 to 2008.

            <p eId="para_3602">I am advised by the Western Regional Fisheries Board (WRFB) that the issue referred to by the Deputy relates to long line eel licences the number of which is capped at 18 in the Galway District of the Western Fisheries Region.  The public licences are issued annually on a first come first served basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3603">Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the draft National Eel Management Plan, a number of management measures have been identified as necessary to reach the targets set in the EU Regulation, including closure of the commercial and recreational fishery from 2009.  In the event that the fishery is closed this year, no eel fishing licences will be issued in any of the fishery regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3604">As regards the mass of eels that have been permitted to bypass the eel weir on the Corrib Fishery in Galway, the WRFB has advised me that it is not possible to quantify the exact amount involved.  However, the Board reduced the number of nets it operates from 14 to 12 in 2007 and 11 in 2008, with 3 nets in the main flow area deliberately not set or fished as a specific conservation measure.  In addition, the Board only fished an average of 20 nights in each of the past 4 years, again reducing the exploitation of the eel stock.  Furthermore, in an effort to quantify the escapement of eels past the weir in Galway in 2008, staff of the WRFB caught 227 eels, tagged each one and released them again into the river 4 kilometres upstream.  Of these, only 11.6% were recovered in the eel nets below, which would appear to suggest that the eel weir in Galway is only exploiting a small proportion of the eels passing through it.  Under the Eel Management Plan no fishery will be operated by the WRFB from 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3610">Some of the information sought by the Deputy is not available.  While there are a number of general requirements around the production and use of biofuels, no specific licences are required from any Department or Agency for the production of biofuels.  I therefore have no function with regard to the "licensing" of either the production or use of biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">There are a number of statutory requirements around planning and environmental control, which need to be met for the establishment of any production facility in this State.  Equally, there are a number of quality requirements that need to be met before fuel is offered for sale and the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners would also need to be complied with for anyone setting up production facilities.  Similarly, there are a number of environmental considerations around the use of biofuels, issues which are the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3612">My primary focus in the coming months is the introduction of the Biofuels Obligation, which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The biofuels obligation is designed to provide a long-term market based framework for the sustainable development of a biofuels sector and delivery of biofuels targets to 2020.  Under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, suppliers will be compelled to use biofuels in the fuel mix, providing a valuable boost to the biofuels industry generally and providing the market stability that the industry so badly needs.  I intend to bring proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to progress the necessary legislation required in order that the Biofuels Obligation is introduced in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_3706">I propose to take Questions Nos. 416 to 421, inclusive, and 423 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3707">Steering a New Course, the Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-13 (the Cawley Report) recommended a restructured fishing fleet, consistent with the sustainable exploitation of available resources and economic requirements of vessel owners and the shore-based industries dependent on it. The Cawley report recommended the voluntary removal of 35% of the capacity of the whitefish fleet to achieve this goal, building on the 10% which has already been removed through the 2005/06 decommissioning Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3708">The Cawley report prioritised in the first instance a decommissioning scheme targeting the larger vessels (18 metres and over) in the whitefish fleet to deliver a basis for both stock recovery and long term viability. This scheme was launched in February 2008.  Forty–six vessel owners have accepted decommissioning grants with a total of 6909 GT and 19,000 Kw being removed from the register.  €21 million was spent on decommissioning in 2008 with a commitment of a further €15.6 million to be spent this year.  75% of this amount will be recouped from the EU.  This level of decommissioning has delivered some 63% of that recommended in the Cawley report for this part of the fleet.  It is important to note that the full €42m budget which had been made available for this voluntary decommissioning scheme was not taken up by fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_3709">The report also noted that a specific economic or social impact analysis should be carried out in relation to vessels under 18 metres to determine the eligibility, urgency scope and cost of carrying out a targeted decommissioning scheme for such vessels.  The Seafood Strategy Implementation Group under the chair of Dr Noel Cawley is currently considering this matter. It is important that any decommissioning of vessels under 18 metres is targeted to take account of the overall strategy to achieve a balance between available resources and the fishing fleet as well as the impact of the current scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">Any new scheme of decommissioning going forward will be considered based on available recourses and their prioritisation.</p>

          the average rental cost to his Department of temporary and prefabricated classrooms; the amount spent by his Department in 2008 on temporary accommodation; if in view of the downturn in the economy, he will negotiate a lower rental charge on such properties in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3747">The average annual rental cost of a temporary-prefabricated classroom works out at €15,428.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost per unit will vary significantly depending on the size, type and age of each unit.  The amount  spent on the rental of temporary accommodation for 2008 was almost €53m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3748">My Department provides grant aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists.  Generally, where schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is responsible for acquiring such temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.</p>
            <p eId="para_3749">As the Deputy will be aware, following analysis of costs in my Department, it is now practice to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than three years.  This should reduce the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3750">A review of rental policy is ongoing which will, <i> inter alia</i>, cover an examination of the contract terms to incorporate buy out, buy back, rental costs and relocation options if local circumstances require it.  The review will involve an investigation of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.  In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of changing market prices.</p>

            <p eId="para_3752">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3753">My Department is currently finalising the position of individual schools and Vocational Education Committees (VECs), including the VEC referred to by the Deputy, in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes includes appellate mechanisms under which schools and VECs can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a  school/VEC is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3755">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools/VECs for the 2009-10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be  published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools/VECs are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>

            <p eId="para_3760">I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 and 450 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3761">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3762">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3763">In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_3764">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the  details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3765">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3766">The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the  allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3768">In the school year 2007-2008 there were 48 secondees to the Second Level Support Service, (SLSS) offering support across a wide range of subject areas in the post primary sector.  This number reduced by one in the 2008-2009 school year.  In 2009-2010 it is envisaged that there will be 53 secondees within the Second Level Support Service as per the following table.</p>
            <p eId="para_3769">Overall across the various services at post primary level there were 156 secondees to the second level sector in 2007/2008, this reduced to 138 in 2008-2009 as a result of five of the services being integrated into SLSS because they had completed their intensive phase of in service.  Further integration from September of this year will see the 2009-2010 number of secondees reduce slightly to 130 at post primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3770">My Department is currently reviewing the various supports offered to teachers in the context of the resources that are available to me.  As part of this exercise, the SLSS is being restructured and other services are folding into its remit.  I am mindful of the need to ensure that we continue to make support available to the sciences.  To this end, my Department is examining the ways in which this might be done by leveraging the capacity which currently exists within the sector, thus ensuring that a wide range of support for all teachers will remain from September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3771">It should be emphasised that the role of the SLSS is to provide support to teachers across subject areas rather than the promotion of the take up of any subject.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3880">I propose to take Questions Nos. 439 and 460 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3881">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3882">I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country.  I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3883">The staffing schedule for the 2009-2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard.  The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.  Under a system that  allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule it is a fact of life that one single pupil change in enrolment can cause a school to lose or gain a teacher.  In recent years when improvements were being made to the staffing schedule it was also the case that there were winners and losers depending on individual enrolment profiles.  If I were to change the staffing schedule to allow the schools that are due to lose a teacher to retain that teaching post I would be treating them differently from other schools with the exact same number on the rolls and I do not propose to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_3884">I have a responsibility to ensure that whatever the overall level of allocation the system for allocating teachers to schools is transparent and fair where everyone knows where they stand and each school knows that it is getting the same number of mainstream class teachers as the school up the road with similar enrolment.  The system should not create anomalies or operate on the basis that one or more schools should be treated differently to others.</p>
            <p eId="para_3885">The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedule.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_3891">There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special  classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3892">These special classes which are to close pre-date the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_3893">All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils.  Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3894">Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of nine pupils in the class.  This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy.  Therefore, the school  no longer qualifies to retain the class.</p>
            <p eId="para_3895">When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes.  Effectively, these schools received a double allocation.  The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3896">All of the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.</p>

            <p eId="para_3900">Private companies are free to promote their business in accordance with accepted marketing practices.  There are also accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and the potential customers.  My Department recognises the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, pupils and  parents to commercial activity.  However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives, provided that such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_3901">As the Deputy will be aware, under Section 15 of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school and is therefore responsible for making decisions as to the types of activities in which the school gets involved.  So the decision as to whether to accept sponsorship or partake in promotions is one for the Board of Management to take.  Naturally, the Board of Management should only engage in activities that are in the best interests of their students.</p>
            <p eId="para_3902">My Department has provided guidance to schools about commercialism and the need for schools to strike a balance between the benefit to be gained from positive links with businesses while at the same time protecting children and their parents from inappropriate marketing etc.  In this context, my Department's circulars — while entrusting school authorities with deciding which activities to engage in — explicitly require them to ensure that pressure is not placed on parents to buy particular products.</p>

            <p eId="para_3938">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.</p>
            <p eId="para_3939">These decisions included the increase of the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools from 18:1 to 19:1. In the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment to 20:1.  This is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source would be in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3957">There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3958">These special classes which are to close predate the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_3959">All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3960">Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, the school no longer qualifies to retain the class.</p>
            <p eId="para_3961">When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3962">All of the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3963">The maximum class size guidelines under Band 1 of DEIS are 20:1 in junior classes (junior infants through to second class) and 24:1 in senior classes (third class through to sixth class).</p>
            <p eId="para_3964">In order to enable the school referred to by the Deputy to adhere to these maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes, 1 additional teaching post under DEIS has been allocated to the school for the 2009/2010 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3965">The position regarding the temporary teaching posts is that the school was allocated three additional temporary posts for the 2007/08 school year. The school was allocated an increase of one permanent teaching post in accordance with the Staffing Schedule for the 2008/09 year and one of the temporary posts was therefore absorbed in this context.   In June 2008, my Department agreed to the school's request to retain the two temporary posts for a further year. This agreement expires in June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3966">The key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_3967">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts, which is a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3968">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3972">The costs in school transport, a service delivered by Bus Éireann on behalf of  my Department, have been increasing arising from a range of issues such as ensuring a comfortable and safe transport service for over 135,000 children daily travelling to and from  school, measures to ensure the highest standards including the phasing out of  the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services, providing all children with an adult seat each; the addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity  shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated school buses with safety belts; increased demands to meet the needs of special needs children; parental choice.</p>

            <p eId="para_4001">I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 to 484, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4002">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4003">In light of the Budget 2009 decision a new circular will be issued to schools  shortly setting out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of  language support teachers.  The budget measures will mean that the level of  language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per  school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.  However, there will be some alleviation for the position of those schools where  there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the  overall enrolment.  Language support posts are allocated during the Spring/Summer period on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed  following receipt from the schools in September 2009 of actual enrolments of  pupils requiring language support.</p>
            <p eId="para_4004">We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teaching posts in our  schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time  posts.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge  will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_4006">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE)  is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs  Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs  Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE  operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_4007">The NCSE has advised that the school in question has the services of two  full-time SNAs to support the care needs of four pupils with special educational  needs, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The pupil has shared  access to this support and the management of this access is a matter for the  school authorities. In addition, the pupil has been allocated 3 hours resource  teaching per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
