I ask that funding be provided for the construction of a new bridge at Cloongullane, just outside Swinford on the N26, and that work commence on the planning of an orbital route for Ballina, County Mayo. If one looks at north and east County Mayo, one will see there is a serious road infrastructure deficit in the area, and there is a reason for that. The roads to which I refer are the N26, a national primary road, which connects with the N59, a national secondary road. The reason for this road infrastructure deficit, as history will show, is that we could not get planning permission for the N26, stage 2, over the line, and this goes back in 2010. It would have gone from Mount Falcon, just outside Ballina, to Bohola. If we had got permission, I would not be asking the Minister of State for funds for the bridge and to begin the orbital route. I refer to the environmental designation. The River Moy is a special area of conservation and in 2010 An Bord Pleanála deemed the road to be over-designed and it wanted to protect whooper swans. Since then, I am glad to say that TII and the council went back to the drawing board and decided that they would try to do it in segments, and not on the same scale. I was not in agreement with that because a proper road into the area is required, but we now have planning permission for Cloongullane, again after much delay over environmental designation. Since 2010, approximately €10 million has been spent on planning on a road and not a sod has been turned. That is pretty serious, and it is because of environmental designation. Wearing his other hat, the Minister of State will know that north Mayo is quite a hub for foreign direct investment, FDI. We have Coca-Cola, Hollister, Lionbridge and a number of other multinational companies which are very much part of the community. Not only do they provide local employment, but they source whatever they require locally. They are very established in the community. The N26 was the number one priority road in the whole of County Mayo but because of the refusal by An Bord Pleanála, it went into the wastepaper basket. That does not take from the case that we need it, and that case still stands. The issue is environmental designation. I refer to the gravity of the situation and the serious deficit in infrastructure. Cloongullane Bridge was not built in the last century but the century before. It is absolutely shocking. Two vehicles cannot pass on it. The bridge has been clipped by the HGVs that travel this road to and from the multinationals, including from Swinford. Something has to be done. This road should not be part of the national primary network. Traffic on the N58, which feeds into Foxford, would have been alleviated by the 2010 plan. Speed limits on the road have been reduced because it is such a winding road. There is a road safety issue here. In terms of this area thriving economically and socially going forward, there is a lot of wherewithal there. There is a very good chamber of commerce in Ballina and there are traders' groups in Foxford and Swinford. There is can-do attitude there, but the road cannot be built without funding. I hope the traffic bedlam at Cloongullane Bridge and going into Ballina every day of the week will be addressed and that we will see construction at Cloongullane this year and the beginning of the orbital route for Ballina.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	4	I thank Senator Mulherin. She has been an advocate for infrastructure during her time here in the Seanad because she has raised so many issues in relation to industry and small businesses with my Department. I can see her point that having critical infrastructure in place is really important. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. In his role, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has responsibility for overall policy and securing capital funding in relation to national roads programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and construction of individual roads is a matter for TII in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Project Ireland 2040 is the long-term overarching strategy to make Ireland a better place for all its people. Within that context, the national development plan, NDP, has been developed by the Government to underpin the successful implementation of the new national strategy framework. This provides the strategic and financial framework for TII's national road programme for the period of 2018-2027. In the ten years covered by the plan, more than €11 billion will be invested in the overall road network. The NDP identifies two categories of national road improvement projects. The first category covers projects to advance to construction subject to the satisfactory outcome of the project appraisal and development consent approval process. The second category relates to projects at pre-appraisal and early planning stage which have been assessed with a view to developing a pipeline of suitable projects for development. Overall, TII considers that taking steady-state of PPP commitments into account, the indicative NDP budget will allow the projects in the first category to be progressed, and a pipeline of projects taken through early planning.However, it would not be possible to take all the pipeline projects through the development consent process or to construction stage within the timeframe of the NDP. The advancing of projects in the second pipeline category will therefore be subject to prioritisation within the overall national roads programme and funding. I refer to the new bridge on the N26 at Cloongullane, Swinford. The preferred route for the proposed N5, N26, N58 Turlough to Bohola and Swinford to Mount Falcon road improvement scheme was adopted by Mayo County Council in July 2015. However, the Minister understands that TII informed Mayo County Council that the scheme could not proceed to phase 3 design at the time due to funding constraints and the requirement, as I have just mentioned, for TII to focus on the progression of those schemes that have been identified for development during the period of the capital investment plan 2016 to 2021 and subsequently the NDP. TII continues to focus on these key objectives. In the interim, TII agreed that the N26 Cloongullaune Bridge realignment should progress as a separate minor improvement scheme to improve the safety of this substandard section of the route. The scheme involves the realignment of a 1.8 km section of the N26 at Cloongullane Bridge and a new bridge crossing over the River Moy. Mayo County Council submitted the scheme and the associated compulsory purchase order to An Bord Pleanála in November 2016. The oral hearing into the proposed road development was convened in March 2017 and An Bord Pleanála confirmed approval for the scheme in December 2018. Technical consultants procured by Mayo County Council are currently undertaking the detailed design of the scheme and preparing the tender documents. Mayo County Council has commenced the pre-qualification process in respect of the tender process and expects that construction will start on this project in quarter two of 2020. The preferred route for the Ballina road project, which is the N26 and N59, was identified in 2006 and adopted by Mayo County Council in 2007. The project was then suspended and remains so. Mayo County Council has proposed a minor improvement scheme, the N26-N59 Ballina bypass phase 1, which comprises carriageway works of 2.1 km, with 1 km of new road construction and 1.1 km of road widening. That would link the N26 with the N59 and in doing so bypass the town of Ballina to the south west. The scheme is being considered as one of a number of minor projects that may commence appraisal, planning and design next year. Regarding major new road projects in County Mayo, the Minister is pleased to advise that the Government approved the awarding of the construction contract for the N5 Westport to Turlough scheme on 15 October. A letter of acceptance issued the following day. Mayo County Council and the contractor formally signed the contract on 29 October 2019. This project involves the construction of 20.3 km of dual carriageway from Westport to east of Castlebar and a 2.5 km single carriageway link to the N59 secondary road.

The reality is that it means nothing to north and east Mayo, although it is welcome. I am asking for modest investment. The Minister of State will agree that the N26 is both a vital artery and the orbital route around Ballina. If it is not done, there will be further tailbacks on the way into the town. These projects should be prioritised, especially since we have HGVs that cannot get in or out of the town, coming and going from our multinationals. This should be a concern. These multinationals have formed a Mayo industries group. They have pointed out the severe deficit in the road. We should be listening. They are serious employers in the area and there would be knock-on benefits for our own indigenous businesses too. This infrastructure is beyond overdue. With his business and enterprise cap on, I ask that the Minister of State make the case to the Minister that he see the significance of and the obvious prioritisation required in respect of these schemes.

It is important that roads in regional areas, not just national secondary roads but regional roads, are upgraded to ensure that they meet the areas covered in Project Ireland 2040 and Future Jobs Ireland, which is very important for us. I will bring Senator Mulherin's concerns back to the Minister. His role is to make policy. It is up to TII, in conjunction with Mayo County Council, to ensure that priority is given to these roads in light of the economic activity in the area, which the Senator outlined, and the many multinational and indigenous companies operating there. It is important that we look after these companies and the employees of the companies who have to drive to work each day. Road safety is a priority for all of us as legislators and also for the Government. The worst section of the N26 route has been addressed by means of the N26 Cloongullane Bridge alignment project, which is currently being progressed as a minor works scheme. There is a traffic calming scheme in the village of Bohola on the N5 but it is important to complete the whole loop. That is all subject to funding. I will certainly bring that to the attention of TII and the Minister.
#TimLombard	unknown-#TimLombard-party	unknown-#TimLombard-dob	unknown-#TimLombard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	7	I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking this matter on behalf of the Minister. The Minister must make a statement on the need for funding for the installation of wheelchair-accessible bus stops in west Cork. West Cork is a huge geographical area. The frightening statistic is that there are only two wheelchair-accessible bus stops in the entire west Cork region, one in Kinsale, which was opened last year, and one in Skibbereen. Both of these bus stops were put in place on the back of local initiatives. One was relocated by a local engineer in Kinsale into the car park. He built it appropriately so that it became wheelchair accessible. The other, in Skibbereen, was made by transition year students coming together to raise funds to alter the bus stop because one of their classmates needed access to a bus and could not get it. That is the history of the two wheelchair accessible bus stops in the entire west Cork region. There is substantial awareness of the need for wheelchair-accessible bus stops. Health and safety measures mean that we cannot have access to these buses until proper stops are put in place. If one looks at the geography of the area, from Kinsale to Allihies, it is a frightening distance, with over 82,000 people living there. There are only two bus stops in the region and it is shameful. I have been calling for a funding stream to be made available and working with the west Cork Wheelchair Association to ensure that we get a line of funding. We noticed this year that the National Transport Authority granted funding to east Cork for the upgrade of 15 bus stops in the east Cork region. This morning, we are looking for that funding stream to continue. The west Cork region will hopefully be considered next year. A programme of works could be put in place. In our assessment, between 18 and 20 bus stops are required to ensure that the west Cork region is sufficiently served. We have people who cannot go to work or school, or even to doctors' appointments because of the lack of wheelchair accessible bus stops. Wheelchair-accessible bus stops give people the opportunity to use public transport, which reduces carbon. Pressure is put on families, communities and support groups, which are really picking up the slack because of the lack of basic core infrastructure. The other issue is cost. Some people are paying €160 for a round trip to go to Cork University Hospital from west Cork for doctors' appointments because there is no access to bus stops. Considering all those issues, a holistic approach is required. Local organisations have done great work.I mentioned the west Cork wheelchair association. Physical infrastructure, such as bus stops, and resources need to be put in place. Patrons want to be active and independent - "independent" is a very important word - and they need to be able to be independent. We need to ensure a funding stream is put in place for next year, as well as ensuring that the west Cork geographic area is considered as a priority and receives the investment required for bus stops.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	8	I thank Senator Lombard for raising this issue. I know his interest in the area of disabilities and he regularly raises the matter, and quite rightly so. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who has responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport. Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has strategy responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated and accessible public transport network. Approximately 86% of the Bus Éireann regional intercity coach fleet is wheelchair accessible, and this figure will increase as the coach fleet is replaced. I am advised that the operation of a wheelchair accessible bus service requires the provision of wheelchair accessible buses and wheelchair accessible bus stops. The wheelchair accessible coaches in the Bus Éireann regional intercity fleet are fitted with either an external hydraulic lift or a ramp. While all bus stops in regional cities are wheelchair accessible, that is not the case in regional and rural areas. In urban areas, the use of low-floor buses with wheelchair ramps means that almost all bus stops are accessible for wheelchair users without the need for modifications to footpaths. These low-floor buses are not generally suitable for use in non-urban areas. At the current time, most services in non-urban areas are delivered by high-floor coaches, which use wheelchair lifts rather than ramps. I am advised that a large flat area of adjacent footpath is required to operate the wheelchair lift, typically 3 m wide and 3.5 m in depth. However, most bus stops in rural areas do not, as Senator Lombard knows, meet those requirements. To address these infrastructural legacy issues, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport funds a programme of accessibility improvement grants, managed by the NTA, to upgrade existing and older infrastructure and facilities, including the installation of accessible bus stops in rural and regional areas of Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Ross, has secured €28 million in funding for the retrofit programme for the period 2018 to 2021. I am advised that in 2018, the NTA engaged engineering designers to undertake accessibility audits of towns with a population of more than 5,000 that have bus stops serviced by high-floor coaches. It identified 43 towns that required accessibility enhancement to accommodate two stops, that is, one in each direction, for coaches, giving a total of 86 new accessible bus stops. I understand that, subject to local authority agreement and input, the NTA plans to have accessible stops in all 43 towns on public service obligation routes by the end of 2021. Senator Lombard raised the issue of accessible bus stops in Cork. The NTA has advised that it is engaging with Cork County Council on the provision of wheelchair lift accessible stops. I am advised that Cork County Council awarded the contract to complete works at Carrigtwohill, Midleton, Castlemartyr and Youghal. Works have commenced in Youghal and all works are expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2020. The NTA hopes to expand this programme to additional locations during 2020 in co-operation with Cork County Council. Furthermore, it is planned to supply 38 low-entry coach-style vehicles to Bus Éireann in the first quarter of 2020. The allocation of those buses to routes in County Cork is an operational matter for Bus Éireann. The NTA also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including the management of Local Link services, which are managed by 15 Local Link offices, including Local Link in Cork, on behalf of the NTA. One of the key objectives of Local Link is the integration of its services with other public transport services, including Bus Éireann services. Approximately 80% of the fleet in use on Local Link services is already wheelchair accessible, and the target is to have at least 95% fully accessible trips by the end of next year. Such services generally operate without the need for accessible bus stops.

He mentioned the programme being rolled out in Carrigtwohill, Midleton, Castlemartyr and Youghal. It should be extended to other regions, such as west Cork, and it is to be hoped there will be a budget for that. I am trying to push for the programme in east Cork, which is delivering 15 bus stops, to have funding for 2020 so that it can be expanded to west Cork and deliver for the six major towns in the area.

It commenced, in conjunction with Cork County Council, in east Cork and the Senator is 100% correct that it is only appropriate that it is extended. Bus Éireann, the NTA and Cork County Council will probably do that in the very near future. It all depends on funding, but it is a positive start. As I said in my reply, the NTA hopes to expand the programme to additional locations in 2020, in co-operation with Cork County Council. Given that Senator Lombard is in such close contact with councillors in Cork, perhaps he could ask them to table a motion at local level to supplement what he is doing at national level. He is doing very good work to ensure he highlights this issue in the Seanad. It would be useful. I will bring back his genuine concerns to the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the NTA to ensure they can complete the programme and install wheelchair accessible bus stops in west Cork locations. It is a good area for industry and tourism and many people in the area use public transport. I support him in this. He should continue to work with his colleagues at local level to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach and that they work in collaboration to ensure bus stops are installed in west Cork in the next round of the programme.

This figure includes adults and children. The number of homeless families has increased by 380% since October 2014. Shame on the Government and the Minister. In October 2019, there were 3,826 children in emergency homeless accommodation with their families. More than one in three people in emergency accommodation are children. The Taoiseach said Santa would find them wherever they are. Santa will have a job getting into some of their accommodation. At the end of October, there were 909 young people, that is, adults aged under 25 years, living in emergency homeless accommodation. This number does not include hidden homelessness, which refers to people who are living in squats or are sofa surfing with friends. Furthermore, women and children staying in domestic violence refuges are not included in the homeless emergency accommodation figures. The national figure also does not include people who are sleeping rough. Last Tuesday, the Central Bank of Ireland stated that this year approximately 21,000 houses will be built, a number that is viewed as far too low and which will contribute to the ongoing imbalance in Ireland's residential property market. The Central Bank says that 34,000 houses will have to be built each year for the next decade just to meet demand. Some years ago I proposed a national solidarity bond in memory of the late Brian Lenihan. It was implemented and worked through An Post. It raised a considerable amount of money. The national solidarity bond is a 1% per year plus bonuses plan. There should be a national building bond. There are enormous resources in this country and an enormous amount of savings. The rate of interest today is 0.25%. If we wish to bring something imaginative forward to raise €100 million, €200 million, €1 billion or €2 billion from the public, I am confident the bond would be subscribed to and could be distributed to the local authorities. It would create a building boom throughout the country. In the 1930s and 1940s, Fianna Fáil Governments built constantly. They built up the towns and villages. I was a beneficiary of that in the 1940s when my parents moved into a local authority house. Now we are running away from this and I cannot understand it. When I was a councillor in the 1970s we built hundreds of houses in well designed estates in Roscommon town. I appeal to the Government to tackle this issue. It must be a national emergency. Regardless of what Government takes over next year, and there will be a change of Government, the Taoiseach will have to take full responsibility and control and organise Ministers to give this the priority it deserves.

The Leader, as an educator, would agree that this film should be shown in every school in the country from the furthest southern point through to the North of Ireland and, indeed, across the UK. It is the most deeply emotional film I have seen and the most balanced report on the deaths of 3,700 people during the Troubles in this country. I thank the Members who were able to attend last night, particularly as Wednesdays can be fairly busy. I did not wish to talk about what I will raise next because I am tired of doing it. I first mentioned the income of county councillors in 2014.In the five years since, nothing has been done. They are still on the same income. They have been promised this time and again. The news was coming at Halloween, then it was coming in January, then it was coming in February, then it was coming at the next AILG meeting and then it was coming at the next LAMA meeting. Nothing has happened, however. I am an Independent Senator. I will not be looking for anybody to put canvassing teams together for me at the next general election. I firmly believe that there is not one parliamentary party in this House willing to put its neck on the line and actually do the right thing by those who represent us at local level. Something needs to be done as a matter of urgency. I would appreciate the Leader's thoughts on one final matter. I have had a number of calls from parents regarding climate action strikes in involving national school children. Some parents are deeply concerned that some of their fellow parents are putting pressure on the schools to take children attending national schools out onto the streets for climate action strikes. The national schools do a very good job in the context of various climate action programmes. The parents I have been speaking to are concerned about two things. The first is the anxiety levels their children are experiencing regarding the world coming to an end and the second is the feeling among them that they are not doing enough. I am all for secondary school students venting their anger at politicians and the like, but when national children are brought onto the streets, and 200 of them and 30 staff are mixed in with secondary school students and God knows who else, a serious liability issue arises. There needs to be clear direction from the Department of Education and Skills in order to ensure that everybody is protected. The most vulnerable of all our citizens are the little kids going to national schools. They can do plenty on climate action in the safe, controlled area of their schools. I do not think being out on the streets is the place for them, neither should they be mixing with 18 and 19 year old secondary school students.

I thank Senator Marshall for bringing it to Leinster House and I thanks all those who attended the screening. I particularly want to acknowledge the fact the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, was there for the duration of the film, which sends a message in terms of his interest in shaping things going forward. It is a profoundly powerful film, probably one of the most powerful things I have ever watched, covering the 3,700 lives that were lost. What really came across is the human tragedy, not the political thing or anything else, but the human tragedy - the mothers, the sons, the brothers, the sisters and the fathers. I thought Michael Hewitt and Dermot Lavery, the producers, did a brilliant job of transposing David McKittrick's book. I recommend that everyone watch the film. Too many people commentate on the conflict in the North, the tragedy involved and all of that, without really understanding. I appeal to the media in this regard. Why this film is particularly important is that, time and again, we have the media looking for the sensational headline. It is almost like watching a game of tennis, backwards and forwards, and it serves to polarise people. I am mindful that, today, elections are taking place in Britain and the North. Again, the polarising of politics and the polarising of people is so dangerous for our society. The media plays a role in that regard. I urge all journalists in the broadcast and print media to take time out - just an hour and a half - to look at "Lost Lives". It was filmed in a very sensitive and balanced way that gives the picture of the human tragedy that we all must work to make sure never, ever happens again. I wish to refer briefly to vulture funds. I will talk about the matter in greater detail next week. There are headlines today about the interest rates being raised by the vulture funds and the flipping over of loans. I put a question to the Central Bank on this matter last week. I see what is happening here in the context of what occurred in the US property market before the crash. Bundles of loans are continually being flipped over in expectation of big profits and high returns. The tragedy at the end of it all is that we have thousands of people who are under threat of being homeless in the months ahead.

I was very sorry I could not get to it myself but I have heard how powerful it was. I am impressed that the Tánaiste was there throughout, which is worthy of note. I commend all those involved. Yesterday, Senators Norris and Gavan spoke very eloquently about the British general election. I want to add my own voice to say that I very much hope that, as a result of the vote today in Britain and Northern Ireland, we will see a change of Government in Britain, see the Labour Party in Britain entering office and see a change of policies and the introduction of Labour's socialist policies that emphasise equality for all and that would reverse the Tory cutbacks that have caused such hardship and poverty across Britain. I hope that in Northern Ireland we will see really good, pro-remain people elected, particularly Claire Hanna in south Belfast, who I know well and who is a really admirable candidate. I wish her and remain candidates generally the very best of luck. I hope that we will have an opportunity in the new year to debate the impact in this jurisdiction of whatever outcome transpires in the British general election. I, for one, very much hope it will be a Labour victory and that we will see a second referendum which will reverse the decision relating to Brexit. No doubt we will have a chance to debate that in the New Year. I want to ask the Leader to arrange a debate on climate change in the new year. We are due to have debates with different Ministers on the various impacts of the Government's climate action plan. I draw colleagues' attention to an email many of us received this week from Mia Treacy on behalf of the school council of Coláiste Éinde girls secondary school in Galway, putting forward a novel but brilliant idea from that school community for a Foraoise na bPáistí, a Government plan to plant a tree for every schoolchild in Ireland as a Christmas present. I thought it was a lovely plan and a very practical way to implement a measure to tackle the climate crisis. The school points out that there are over 800,000 primary and secondary school pupils in Ireland. While there may not be time to plant a tree for each at them this Christmas, it would be nice to incorporate this plan into our discussions on climate action in the new year and to urge the Government to take on board this novel but very positive suggestion. Clearly, the Government, through Coillte, owns a great deal of forested land but we need to see more reforesting. This proposal for over 800,000 trees to be planted, which is symbolically one for every child in Ireland, given how schoolchildren have led so proactively and brilliantly in terms of the climate change movement across the world, would be a really fitting gesture. I am delighted Time magazine has named Greta Thunberg as its international person of the year. That is very fitting and, again, it is great to see the huge initiative of schoolchildren being marked in this important way.

The Seanad committee on Brexit will be launching a report on Tuesday next. The committee, on which Senators Craughwell, Marshall and I sit, will be placing a motion before the House and we very much look forward to debating what will be the committee's final report in due course.Rather than seeking a debate on an update on Brexit and relations with the UK next year, as Senator Bacik suggested, I think it is far more urgent than that. I am instead calling on the Leader to see if we can find time next week to debate that. UK politics moves far more swiftly than our politics in terms of the formation of a government. We will have a much clearer idea by Tuesday or Wednesday what the next government in the UK will be. It is crucially important to Ireland, probably more so than with any previous UK election, that we debate that and look at what lies ahead for the next month or beyond for this island. I call on the Leader to see if the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade could facilitate that as early as next week. I will not go into individual candidates or parties, far from it, but the issues at stake that affect this island and this country are so important that we urgently need to have that debate.
#IanMarshall	unknown-#IanMarshall-party	unknown-#IanMarshall-dob	unknown-#IanMarshall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	22	Today is a monumental day in UK and Northern Irish politics. We are all aware of the significance of the vote today. There will be change. We all know that sometimes change is a good thing so we will have some change of personnel. It is important to note that this gives Northern Ireland a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate leadership. When there is a bit of a shuffle and shake up, it provides the people with a chance to shine and show that leadership. Whatever happens in Great Britain today and whatever happens with regard to Brexit, it is important to note that the sky will not fall in. The relationship between Dublin and London is very important and needs to be maintained. As Senator Richmond said, there has been a lot of work behind the scenes and credit must be given to those people who have tried to prepare Ireland and Northern Ireland for a potential Brexit. To echo what was said by Senators Craughwell and Conway-Walsh, I extend my sincere thanks to all Senators and Deputies who attended the screening of "Lost Lives" last night. It was my second time to watch the film and I thought naively that it would be an easier watch the second time around but it was equally powerful. I am told by people that no matter how many times one watches it, it is a very powerful piece of cinematography. In particular, I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for taking time out of a very busy schedule. Not only did he come in advance of the screening, he stayed for the duration and participated in the question-and-answer session afterwards. I am very grateful for that. He did add to that conversation. One word that really summed up what we witnessed last night is "futility" - the futility of the conflict and what happened and the pain, loss and suffering that very often we did not see on the television news reports. I mean this completely respectfully but it was a side that many people in this House did not see. It was something that happened up there - something in the distance - and it was horrible but we did not really understand it. The film must serve as a reminder that we can never allow ourselves to go back to that situation because it was a horrible time. My family and I lived through it and like the book, the film triggered memories and horrible images of what happened. It was the pain, the hurt and broken people. The point was well made last night by the Tánaiste that this was not about 3,700 people; it was about tens of thousands of people's lives that were impacted by this. These people would never get over the pain and suffering.  Due to the significance of today with the UK general election, it is worth noting that the role of the Tánaiste in the talks on getting the institutions in the North up and running is critical. I would like everybody in this House to give as much support as possible to getting those institutions up and running because we must give credit to the people living and working in Northern Ireland every day - the politicians who are still there albeit without an Executive. That work is still being done. People are working tirelessly behind the scenes. There are loyalists and republicans who are working very hard to make sure that the institutions are up and running to give a degree of normality back to Northern Ireland. Unlike some of the negativity reported through the media, a lot of positive things are happening in Northern Ireland and there is a good opportunity to move the conversation forward.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	23	Today is a very big day for the UK but also for the island of Ireland. No matter what happens today, I hope the island of Ireland, particularly Northern Ireland, will not be forgotten because it was forgotten about when the Brexit referendum took place. We are now working twice as hard to undo the difficulties that have occurred since the referendum. I attended that screening of "Lost Lives" last night. I thank Senator Marshall and the Tánaiste for attending. I became aware of the book "Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children Who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles" about two or three years ago through a newspaper article. I remember going into Hodges Figgis on Dawson Street to buy it. First of all, it was not on sale, although I see that it costs nearly €300 on Amazon. This book is a masterpiece by David McKittrick and four other authors. The film last night did huge justice to this masterpiece - a horrific masterpiece. Of all the stories of horrific killings, of which there were over 3,700, one really touched me. It was the story of a man called Billy Giles, a UVF volunteer who abducted and shot a Catholic friend in 1982. He served time in prison and on his release weeks after the Good Friday Agreement, he hung himself. In his note, he said that he was a victim of the Troubles, that the environment in which he lived turned him into a killer and that he wanted new generations to know the regret and remorse he felt. I say this because when I went into the Oireachtas Library to get that book three years ago, it had been out on loan with a Member for four years so none of the 250 Deputies and Senators and research staff had looked for that book. This film will be broadcast on the BBC but it should be shown in every school, church and facility around this country. Senator Marshall is right. We turned our backs on the people of the North. It should be compulsory for any of these keyboard warriors who talk about this, that and the other to read this book because the lives of 3,700 people were taken and we need to look at that. During the discussion after the screening of the film, one of the contributors said that we need to love the people of the North much more. We need to show that we are interested. If we are to have an agreed Ireland, we must make huge sacrifices ourselves. It is not a one-way street. It is a two-way street and we need to dig deep and show that we care because sometimes talk or emotion will not solve it. We must be able to dig deep and show that we really care and really want to show the love to the people of the North, who are good people.

Dr. Kevin McCarthy said that he made the "difficult decision" as the service is "completely unsustainable" and did not meet the needs of sick children. He said he needs a full team and sufficient funding, which has not been forthcoming. The same thing happened about two years ago in the Wexford-Waterford area with regard to children's mental health. Three consultants resigned from their posts leaving no consultant cover, which has continued to this day. A Saturday morning consultant travels from Galway to see children on a never-ending waiting list in Waterford and Wexford. A state-of-the-art building - the national children's hospital - is in progress and a satellite centre will be opened in Tallaght Hospital next year. The Connolly satellite centre opened in July 2019 but only operates Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. because of the difficulties in recruiting medical staff. How are we going to recruit and retain medical staff for the national children's hospital in its entirety?I would like an update from the Minister as to the projected opening hours for Tallaght, the staffing that is in Connolly, the staffing in Tallaght, how they are recruiting those staff, and what is in process for the bigger mothership at St. James' Hospital. Has the consultants offer that the Minister made yesterday been accepted or is it going to cause more difficulties? I would like him to come in and explain and update this House on how we manage our children's health and how we are going to replace immediately the pain consultant.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	25	I agree with other colleagues about the election in the North today. I know many people in this House, like my colleagues, Senators Richmond, Feighan, Marshall, the Leader, and so on, have done extraordinary work and will continue to do that, so it is to be hoped it will be a good result. I was at a launch in the audiovisual room this morning of a very important report on direct provision. There are 43 very strong recommendations in the report. I know we are only after having statements on direct provision, but maybe in the new year it would be no harm to bring the Minister in to discuss that particular report, because a lot of work went into it. It is a very strong report. There were a lot of people from the NGO sector at the event this morning, and I certainly believe that some of the recommendations are worthy of serious consideration. I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will consider them. The situation that has emerged in the past couple of days regarding the national lottery is very worrying. It is a private company. We pass legislation here to sell the licence. While people at the time back in 2013 to 2014, including me and Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell in particular, raised concerns about the principle of selling the national lottery and selling this important State asset to a private company under licence, what has emerged today and in the past couple of days about €180,000 of prizes that were advertised but were not included on the tickets for sale is very worrying. There is a regulator of the national lottery. Its job is to regulate one company, the national lottery. There are ten people working in the lottery regulator's office. The regulator has full, real-time access to all of the sales reports and games of the national lottery, yet it was an internal audit of the national lottery itself that discovered it. I want to know what the regulator is doing. It seems like a shocking waste of money for an office of ten people. I really believe that the national lottery regulator needs to consider her position, and the Minister needs to come in to the House and give an update on exactly what reporting structures this regulator has with Government. It is a very serious situation. The members of the public who spend their few euro on national lottery games should have the confidence that the integrity of the process is protected.

We all know it is below the cost of production. I would like to make a Christmas appeal. I would like to make that appeal to Larry Goodman today, that Larry Goodman would pay to farmers a fair price for their animals when they present at his factories. The meat industry is profitable and is growing, and we know that by virtue of exports, the new markets that have been won by Government in the likes of China, and by virtue of live exports. This is an area where a lot of people, such as multiple retailers and meat processors, are making money, and yet a basic condition, which is that farmers be paid the cost of production, is not happening. It is true he does not own all the factories around the country - we all know that - but he is the man with the influence. While he does not own these factories, he very much influences the factors that control prices and it is the very reason every farmer who presents to a factory on a Monday morning is pretty much getting paid the same price. We have had the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission at times tell us it does not have enough evidence in relation to the issue, but I can tell Senators that with the suite of legislation that is going to come and is in the pipeline, based on the European unfair trading practices directive and price transparency directive, which are required to be implemented for the food supply chain, and the introduction of a regulator with teeth, which is envisaged by both Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, the net is closing. At the moment, farmers are getting between €3.50 and €3.55, and they need €4 to break even. Our year has been marked by discontent on the part of farmers, with disruption and blockades at factory gates throughout the summer. More recently, the capital was brought to a standstill with tractor blockades, and now the IFA is blockading wholesale distribution centres for the multiple retailers. Where does it all lead back to? It all leads back to Larry Goodman. He should do the right thing here. If he does not, he is going to kill the golden goose that is laying the eggs that are making the profits for him, and there will not be farmers who will want to undertake producing suckler animals or beef animals.

I will say this. It is a good time for us to reflect on the unsatisfactory nature of the often binary choices before electorates on either side of the water as we look out. Political leadership of a quality kind is in short supply. There is no heroic, obvious British Prime Minister to emerge. There are dangers whichever way one looks if one is wise and mature in one's politics. It seems to me that very often what we are faced with now is a coalition or a coincidence of interests between the intentionally and recklessly selfish on the one hand and the unintentionally selfish on the other. On the left, one sees an inconsistency, a lack of respect for life itself, a well-meaning, perhaps idealistic, but negative individualism, and on the right, one sees a selfishness that one can associate with a culture that is increasingly unconcerned about drug-taking and all sorts of life choices that end up harming others. There is a real need for better political leadership on all sides, and I would be very slow to express a preference as to the outcome of the election. One thing I think I can say with certainty on another subject is when confidential files that contradicted Beijing's claims about the voluntary re-education, so-called, of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities were handed over recently to the international consortium of investigative journalists, we saw a catalogue of horrors and depravity. In fact, what those files reveal is that it is actually possible to put a price on the value of human life. We are doing it ourselves in Ireland and Europe, because there is a real and quantifiable risk that our foreign policy stance with respect to China is nothing more than a Potemkin village of righteous indignation empty of meaning and devoid of moral courage. The same could be said for the European foreign policy stance with respect to China, in particular its treatment of the Uyghur population. At official level, people are not standing up to the bullies, especially if they are the kind of bullies we can trade with, generous bullies who buy our beef or whatever it is. What we effectively do is write them strongly worded letters appealing for them to heed the norms outlined in various human rights agreements or covenants, but bullies do not respect reason. They listen with indifference as their victims or even their friends plead, even with the greatest of eloquence, for mercy. The unavoidable interpretation we must now give to how we are continuing to conduct our bilateral and international relationship with China, specifically in the context of the barbaric treatment of the Uyghur population, is that we just do not care. The €17 billion in goods and services that is the worth of our bilateral trade can be set against the one million Uyghurs affected by brutal Chinese state repression.That is a value of approximately €17,000 that we place, or do not place, on every Uighur whose life has been destroyed or who has been tortured or brutalised by the current regime in Beijing. Even as we criticise Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Donald Trump or the Democratic Party candidate, whoever that may be, we need to take a close look at the moral quality of our politics here at home.

I raise an issue to which Senator Mulherin referred earlier in the week regarding the passive and A-rated houses that are being built throughout the country. I am calling on the Central Bank to relax the multiplier for mortgages, particularly in the context of A-rated and passive houses. As Senator Mulherin pointed out, the electricity and heating costs of some of those houses can be as low as €100 per year, therefore, a person with an A-rated or a passive house has extra capacity to make additional payments. The Central Bank has got to look at this issue and relax the multiplier rule in respect of the amount of money a person can borrow in order to buy a house. It makes absolute sense that a person who buys an A-rated house as opposed to someone who buys a house that has extensive and expensive heating and electricity charges has extra money to pay back a loan to buy a passive house. That is the way forward. Those are the types of houses that the Government and those involved in taking climate action are proposing. That is the way the building industry has gone. The Central Bank is behind the times in this regard. It is putting undue pressure on people who cannot get the money to buy homes. Builders have a problem building houses for a price people can pay. I am calling on the Central Bank to relax the multiplier in respect of people who are buying A-rated or passive houses.

I commend Senator Marshall on his proactivity last night. Senator Marshall and Senator Conway-Walsh made their points in the context of the futility of what happened and the human tragedy It is important to put on record that the human tragedy can never be underestimated. It is about building and binding communities in the North. That is why it is so important that we have a return to the institutions and get Stormont up and running as a matter of urgency. I appeal to those on all sides of the debate in the North to ensure that Stormont gets up and running and that a Government is put in place. I remind Senator Mullen that 800,000 Irish people can vote today in the UK and that 1 million can vote in the North. It is a very important election in the context of Brexit. As I have said in the past, there is no good Brexit outcome for us no matter what happens. Democracy is precious. The Senator may well speak about the minimum amount of choice. I would encourage him to run as a candidate in the next general election-----

It is an important post. I am not familiar with the exact reasons he resigned other than what I read in the newspapers this morning. The Department of Health, the HSE and the hospital group are, I am sure, working actively on that. It is important to recognise that there is a significant investment of €17 billion in our health system. The report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health showed that there are almost 138,000 employed in the HSE. A real question needs to be asked about where the €17 billion is going and how it is that we cannot deliver better outcomes for people because of the way we spend our money. The Senator will agree with me that €17 billion of taxpayers' money is a significant budget for the health system and we still have issues in that sector. It is not a question of throwing money at it but of reforming the structure and activating and expediting Sláintecare. I will invite the Minister for Health to come to the House in due course to discuss the matter.  Senator Conway spoke about today's report on direct provision, which I have not read, and the 43 recommendations. We had a very good debate here last week on direct provision and I will be happy to have the Minister come back to update the House.  The issue of the national lottery is very worrying on two fronts. First, an internal audit discovered there was an anomaly in several of its games. Second, we need to question the role of the regulator, as Senator Conway said. It is unacceptable that the national lottery can come back now and say it has spotted this anomaly and is going to apologise. Confidence in it needs to be restored. We did sell it off but that decision has worked in other jurisdictions.  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of the price of beef. The point she makes this morning is a very reasonable one, on the issue of the meat factories giving a just price to the farmers. I appeal to all Members of the House and those watching and listening today to shop in their local butchers this Christmas, to support our small indigenous industries because through our support we can galvanise local economies. There is a need for the beef task force to sit down. I appeal to those involved in the talks to recognise the role of agriculture. As Senator Mullen said, we have opened new markets, particularly in China, but it is important that our farmers, whom we all support, are recognised.  Senator Mullen raised the issue of human rights in China and how we and any government around the world engages with the Chinese authorities, given their lack of respect for human rights, minorities and other groupings. It is a good point. We need to be balanced. As the Senator says, we cannot just send a strongly worded letter and expect that to be okay. More needs to be done and I support the Senator in that view. I would be happy to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade back to the House on that matter.  Senator Paddy Burke referred to the documentary last night on RTÉ regarding the role of undertakers in our society. It showed the care and compassion of the undertaker at a very stressful and emotive time for many families. I join the Senator in congratulating and thanking all our undertakers. He also referred to passive homes and the multiplier for mortgages. This House does not have a way to invite the Central Bank but I would be happy to have the Minister for Finance or one of the Ministers of State in that Department come to the House to discuss it.

They are here for the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill, which will be dealt with later. I welcome the opportunity to be in the Seanad again and to present amendments to the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill which have been introduced and passed by the Dáil. Senators will recall that I introduced the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill here in the Seanad on 10 October 2019. In summary, the Bill provides for the granting of lending powers to Enterprise Ireland and contains other provisions relating to enhanced support for research, development and innovation in several critical sectors such as horticulture. The Bill also includes a technical amendment to increase the aggregate capital funding that can be provided to IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland from €7 billion to €14 billion. As primary legislation currently sets a statutory limit of €7 billion on the aggregate capital funding that can be provided to these agencies since 1993, it has been deemed timely to increase the aggregate amount into the future. A further technical amendment provides for an increase in the aggregate limit on grants made to capitalise Microfinance Ireland to enable it to provide increased lending in the event of a disorderly Brexit. Having passed all Seanad Stages, the Bill was referred to the Dáil for assent on 23 and 24 October. On Committee Stage, two similar amendments were introduced by Deputy Munster of Sinn Féin to section 3.7A(2) and section 3.7B(1)(c) of the Bill, respectively, to the effect that "Preference may be given to industrial undertakings or body corporates that are located in the border counties of Louth, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo." Section 3.7A, where the first amendment has been accepted, refers to the powers of Enterprise Ireland to make loans. Section 3.7B, where the second amendment has been accepted, refers to the powers of Enterprise Ireland to purchase or take shares or convertible debt instruments. These amendments were subsequently passed by the Dáil. Therefore, I am here today to present the amendments to the Bill for final assent by the Seanad. I take this opportunity to emphasise that I am acutely aware of the vulnerabilities, due to the challenges of Brexit, of businesses not only in the Border counties but also for certain business sectors right across the country. These challenges may, however, be tougher along the Border region. Government continues to face these challenges through initiatives such as the regional enterprise plans, Project Ireland 2040 and Future Jobs Ireland, which provide the impetus to drive regional growth and resilience for economic development and good quality job creation. What is encouraging for the Border region is the steady decline in the unemployment rate since the start of the previous regional action plan for jobs and the fact that the rate has fallen from 8.6% to 3.9%. The Government's announcement in budget 2020 of a €110 million package of Brexit contingency supports which we are ready to roll out in a no-deal scenario will be targeted at assisting all vulnerable but viable firms, whatever their circumstances. Budget 2020 also provides a €40 million fund which will be available to support tourism in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This funding will be focused on the regions that will suffer most from a no-deal Brexit, such as the Border counties and the south-east. The regional breakdown of funding to Enterprise Ireland client companies shows that 65% of funding in 2018 went to regions outside of Dublin, with funding of €11.4 million in grants for industry and research and development awarded to client companies in the north-east-north-west region in 2018, which represents an increase of 12% over the 2017 figure. We continue our work to prepare for the UK's exit, in whatever way that unfolds. Even with an agreement, it is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU and this will bring change. Since July 2019, my Department has hosted four Brexit outreach events in Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Louth. These events focused on advising businesses of the steps they need to take now to prepare their businesses for Brexit and highlighted the supports available to businesses to help them with such preparations. My Department also directly emailed over 220,000 companies to encourage them to act now to prepare for Brexit and to promote the array of supports available to them to assist them. Officials from my Department have also worked with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society to encourage its members to prepare for Brexit now and promote the supports available to them. Furthermore, my Department has responsibility for a wide range of regulatory agencies and offices, and they are all engaged in stakeholder events, road shows and information sessions to inform and share information with those most impacted by Brexit. Therefore, companies located in all regions will continue to be supported to respond to the challenges of Brexit through all appropriate existing Enterprise Ireland supports, those contingency supports which were announced in budget 2020 and the enhanced supports which we are providing for in this Bill. I was delighted on Monday last to be turn the sod on a new IDA Ireland factory in Monaghan town. That is something that we have waited 30 years for. It certainly is good to see that work progressing. I am also glad that through the regional enterprise fund we were able to provide funding for a bioconnect research centre which will be important. That is just developments that have happened in one county. There are good developments happening right across the Border region. Only a number of weeks ago, I visited WuXi in Dundalk. The company had already announced 400 jobs, and now there are another 200 jobs. These are high-quality jobs. That is the kind of employment we want in the Border region because it will be impacted more severely by Brexit than any of the other regions. Only a few weeks ago, we had another foreign direct investment company and I announced 60 new jobs at Newbaze in Carrickmacross. There is real progress but we need to continue to make sure that we have the right infrastructure in place and that we continue to attract investment into the Border regions, whether it is Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan or Louth. Finally, I thank Senators for supporting this Bill and for their ongoing support in progressing this legislation as quickly as possible.

#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-12-12 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	131	It might be helpful to recall briefly the background to the Bill and the process leading to the Government's amendments. This Bill originated in the Seanad as a Private Members' Bill introduced by Senators Gallagher, Ardagh and Swanick. The Government agreed not to oppose it but to bring forward Committee Stage amendments in due course. Senators will recall that the Bill's primary objective is to deal with what are widely seen as potential adverse consequences for ground rent tenants of a 2012 ruling of the Supreme Court. The manner in which the Supreme Court interpreted certain technical provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 in its ruling has narrowed the scope of the ground rents purchase scheme. This means that certain ground rent tenants who had been eligible to acquire the freehold title in their properties may no longer be eligible to do so. Following the passing of the Bill by the Seanad, my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, established an expert group with membership drawn from the Attorney General's office, his Department and external experts, including land law expert Professor John Wylie, to consider the proposals in the Bill and to recommend any necessary amendments. The Government amendments I am reporting to the House seek to give effect to the expert group's recommendations. Their objective is to reduce the risk of future challenges to the legislation on the grounds that it could be seen as infringing the property rights of ground rent landlords, which are safeguarded under the Constitution. The first group comprises amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. I regret that many of the Government amendments involve intricate and complex detail, but that is the nature of ground rents legislation. The substance of this group of amendments concerns the issue of rateable valuation. Strange as it may seem, there is no statutory definition of ground rent in ground rents legislation. That is because a ground rent can arise in many different situations. Instead of a definition, the ground rents legislation outlines various conditions that must be met for a rent to qualify as a ground rent and for a tenant to be eligible to exercise his or her right to acquire the freehold title. Section 9 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 outlines conditions that must be complied with, one of which requires further compliance with one of the conditions outlined in section 10. The second condition in section 10, a condition that is frequently relied on in the case of buildings that may have existed before the lease was granted, is that the lease in question is for a period of not less than 50 years and the annual rent payable is less than the amount of the rateable valuation of the property on the date on which the application to acquire the freehold is made. The fifth condition in section 10 also contains reference to a rent that is lower than the rateable valuation of the property on the date on which the lease was granted. It deals with the complex situation arising where a lease is granted in succession to a lease that would have been covered by ground rents legislation had the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 Act been in place at the time. Similarly, in section 15(1)(d) of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 Act, which relates to yearly tenants, one of the eligibility conditions is that the yearly rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property on the date on which the application to acquire the freehold is made. In short, in the case of the second and fifth conditions of section 10 and in section 15(1)(d) there is a rebuttable presumption that if the annual rent payable is lower than the annual rateable valuation, the rent is a ground rent rather than a commercial rent and, that being the case, the ground rent tenant has a right to acquire the freehold title of the property. Clearly, the rateable valuation referred to in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 is the rateable valuation applying before the roll-out of the new valuation system arising from the national revaluation programme under the Valuation Act 2001. It is against this backdrop that the expert group concluded that certain amendments to both the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 and the Valuation Act 2001 relating to rateable valuation were required to safeguard the operation of the second and fifth conditions of section 10 as well as section 15(1)(d) of the 1978 Act. Amendment No. 1 inserts a reference to the Valuation Act 2001 in the Long Title while amendment No. 2 inserts a definition of the Act into section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978. Amendment No. 5 contains several important changes to section 10 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978. The first of these is a technical amendment to the first condition. The second is the substitution of a new text for the second condition, which incorporates a number of elements. The first element is the inclusion of a definition of "rateable valuation" by reference to certificates issued by the Commissioner of Valuation under sections 67 and the new section 67A of the Valuation Act 2001. The second addresses another important matter arising from the Supreme Court ruling which relates to the definition of "predecessors in title". The expert group agrees that clarification on this point is required and the revised text incorporates a definition of "predecessors in title" that is broadly in line with proposals already in the Private Members' Bill. The third change to section 10 is a technical adjustment to the reference to rateable valuation in condition 5(a). The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the amendments to the second condition of section 10 will apply to notices of intention and applications made to acquire freehold title after the date of publication of the amendments to the Bill, that is, 5 November 2019. Amendment No. 6 makes a similar provision in respect of section 15 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978, which deals with the rights of yearly tenants. Amendment No. 7 inserts two new sections, section 67A and 67B, in the Valuation Act 2001. Both sections provide an essential mechanism whereby the Commissioner of Valuation may issue valuations that are, in effect, rateable valuations referred to in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978. These valuations would have existed before the roll-out of the new valuation system under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. These amendments are necessary to provide the required proofs to ground rent tenants seeking to exercise their rights under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978. Section 67A deals with property that is rateable under the 2001 Act, that is, does not fall under Schedule 4. It allows the commissioner to have such property valued for the purposes of the second condition of section 10 and section 15(1)(d)(i) of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 by reference to the date on which the application to acquire the freehold title is made.Section 67B deals with the valuation of property for the purposes of condition 5 of section 10, which refers to the rent being less than the rateable valuation of the property on the date on which the lease was granted following the expiration or surrender of a previous lease. This allows the commissioner to issue a certified copy extract of a valuation list in existence by reference to the date on which the new lease was granted, stating the rateable valuation of the property. I apologise to Members for the length of my intervention on these amendments. However, it is necessary to provide as much clarity as possible on the changes being made to the text of the Bill as initiated for the benefit of the House.

Currently, eligibility to acquire the freehold title does not exist in the case of an improvement to such buildings but will arise where the alteration or reconstruction causes the buildings to lose their original identity. This formulation has given rise to some confusion and uncertainty over the years. The Government's amendments, based on the expert group's recommendations, adopt a somewhat different approach from achieving the same objective as the Private Members' Bill. They seek to do so in a manner that reduces the risk of a future constitutional challenge. The Bill's proposals to delete subsection (1)(b) and subsection (2) of section 9 would remove those provisions that require that the permanent buildings are not simply an improvement of the buildings as defined in subsection (2). The expert group has agreed that the concept of an improvement creates uncertainty and should be dropped from the legislation. However, instead of simply repealing subsection (1)(b) and inserting a new definition of permanent buildings in a new subsection (6), the expert group has proposed that subsection (1)(b) be amended to exclude the reference to an improvement, but with a revised focus on whether the buildings in question have lost their original identity, together with the revised wording of paragraph (c). These amendments are complemented by the new subsection (6), which sets out a number of factors to be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the permanent buildings have lost their original identity.

Today brings to a conclusion the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill, which I first introduced to the House in November 2017. The Bill is an amendment to existing legislation that enables a tenant, under certain prescribed conditions, to have the opportunity to buy out the freehold of his or her premises. It is an honour for me personally to bring this legislation back to the House for completion on behalf of the business people on the west side of Main Street, Carrickmacross, and indeed for other business throughout Ireland that hold qualifying leases. They will now, thankfully, have the right to buy out the freehold of their premises and end hundreds of years of being tied to landlords. In the case of Carrickmacross, it dates to the time of Elizabeth I. This Bill is an example of how politics on all sides can work together for the benefit of all our citizens. The story of this Bill began with a documentary, entitled "What's next for Carrickmacross", produced and edited by Mr. Pat Byrne of Carriage Productions. I am delighted that Pat is here today. It was presented by Mr. Michael Fisher who I understand is also in the Gallery this afternoon. They are both welcome. The documentary drew sharp focus to the problems facing tenants with qualifying leases in Carrickmacross and throughout Ireland as a result of a Supreme Court decision in 2012 in the case of the O'Gorman family. I am delighted to see Gus and Cathal here from Carrickmacross, and JDS Holdings, known locally as the Shirley estate. It was an excellent documentary, on which I compliment Pat. It highlighted the fact that a number of lawyers, both in the academic world and in practice, had serious reservations regarding the judgment of the Supreme Court. The first step on the journey that has taken us here today was a meeting that was set up with our justice spokesperson, Deputy O'Callaghan, and former Ceann Comhairle, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, whom I am delighted to see here today. Pat Byrne introduced a gentleman called Professor John Wylie, a leading academic on all matters relating to land law who featured in Pat's documentary, to Mr. Tony Donagher, a local Carrickmacross-based solicitor who I am delighted to see here this afternoon. Together, Professor Wylie and Tony Donagher drafted the legislation in the summer of 2017. I introduced the Bill to this House in November 2017 and was delighted that it received support from all sides of the House. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, said on Final Stage in the Seanad that he would set up a special working group to strengthen the first draft. He did so, and I was delighted that Professor Wylie was a member of that working group. I thank the officials in the Minister's office for their work. I am sure they began to think I was hounding them in this process but I was conscious of the timeframe of the lifetime of this Government and was anxious for this legislation to be carried through both Houses before this Government calls it a day. On 6 November 2019, in the Select Committee on Justice and Equality, chaired by Deputy Ó Caoláin, our local Deputy, the Government introduced some working amendments to the Bill. On 4 December 2019, the Government presented the Bill to the Dáil for Report and Final Stages, which, thankfully, passed successfully. I thank all my fellow Oireachtas Members from all parties for their support for the Bill. I also take the opportunity to acknowledge the support of local councillors from the Carrickmacross-Castleblayney municipal district, namely, P.J. O'Hanlon who is here this afternoon, former councillor Pádraig McNally, now retired, Noel Keelan, Colm Carthy and Aidan Campbell, for their support. It was very much appreciated. There have been many other people, some of whom I am delighted to see here today, who have helped to get this Bill to where it is. I thank them too for their efforts.Tenants who wish to buy out the freehold on the premises they occupy will now be able to do so with the passing of this Bill, giving them business certainty and the ability to reinvest in and expand their business without the stress of not knowing what tomorrow might bring. The passing of the Bill will confirm the original intention of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which was to confer rights on tenants who have long occupied their premises and who have over the years developed such premises at their own expense. When the Bill was introduced, it was remarked that is is an example of what is called new politics at work. I see it as good politics and a great example of what can be achieved with cross-party support on an important issue such as this which impacts not just the good people of Carrickmacross but indeed the entire country. Again, I express my sincere thanks to everyone who supported the legislation and worked together in a collaborative way to address this long-running issue. I am delighted we have now crossed the final fence. Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir.

It is a great day for him to have a Private Members' Bill pass all Stages in both Houses. What is good for Carrickmacross is good for Ireland. The consequences of the legislation will benefit people in many towns throughout the country. I come from Ennistimon, County Clare, where, I think, Devas was the gentleman to whom people paid their ground rent. It was up to the estates in England or wherever else as to whether they would sell the properties. When this legislation is passed, signed by the President and enacted, it will benefit a great many people. I acknowledge the presence of the people in the Gallery. It is a great day for them. I see a former Ceann Comhairle, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, in the Gallery. It is wonderful to see new politics working because new politics is good politics. The one thing about Seanad Éireann is that, more so than even the Lower House, Members engage in good politics and come together on important issues a lot of the time. When something is right and we all regard it as right, it is done.

I also congratulate Senator Gallagher. It is tough getting legislation through, but when one gets to the final curtain it feels really good because one is doing something worthwhile. I acknowledge the work of my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, which Senator Gallagher also acknowledged. Deputy Ó Caoláin has sought to address this issue over many years. In his role as Chairman of the Select Committee on Justice and Equality, he recently facilitated the Bill's passage through Committee Stage. I welcome the delegation from Carrickmacross. They have been to the fore of our thinking and consideration on the Bill. I say "Well done" to all of them. I will not remember all their names but Senator Gallagher has read them into the record so they will be there. While it was great to see such cross-party consensus delivering results in a timely manner, we must not think the issue of ground rents has been resolved or gone away. The legislation addresses an anomaly that seems most evident in Carrickmacross but I acknowledge there are other similar places, perhaps as yet undiscovered, throughout the country. My stance is that ground rents should be confined to the history books. They stick in the craw. It is time for them to go. There have been many appeals to protect precious property and the Constitution, but it is time for us to make this change. Everyone throughout the country has a similar feeling on paying ground rent to landlords. To the best of my knowledge, the State pays a landlord ground rent associated with Iveagh House. It is a little ironic that the conducting of one's own external affairs, which is a benchmark of sovereignty, is dependent on payments to figures associated with our past. This represents an odious hangover from colonialism. Perhaps the Minister will focus on that at some point, but not today. I do not want to pay my own ground rent. Many people have come to me to discuss this issue, but the hands are put up and it is said there is no remedy in the Constitution and that this cannot be stopped. We have matured, however. This is a republic, so let us try to act like it is.

This Bill has received support from all sides of the House during its passage through Dáil Éireann and the Seanad, and I thank colleagues in both Houses for that support. As we know, the issue of ground rents in Carrickmacross has been long-running. It culminated in a Supreme Court judgment in 2012. That judgment had serious implications for local businesses on the west side of the town and their ability to buy out the freehold relating to their properties. I am delighted to see all the guests in the Gallery. I know they have made a huge effort in that every time the Bill has passed through another Stage, whether in the Dáil, in the Seanad or on Committee Stage, they have been present. I thank them for that. Earlier this year, a Bill was introduced in the Seanad by my colleague, Senator Gallagher, to try to address this issue. The Bill was well intentioned and had cross-party support. However, it gave rise to a number of legal and constitutional issues. I will not go through them all again. I was concerned that it would be referred to the Law Reform Commission and could have been subject to a lengthy process there. This is why I met the Minister for Justice and Equality and asked that an expert group be established to advise the Government on this complex matter. I absolutely realise the urgency of this and, like the rest of my colleagues, wanted it dealt with as quickly as possible. The expert group comprised a number of legal experts, including Professor Wiley, who I know had been working very closely with solicitor Tony Donagher, who is also here today, and officials from the Department of Justice and Equality. They completed their work, which meant we would be able to make the necessary amendments to the Bill in order that it was legally sound. In order to expedite the Bill, I have taken it through all Stages of the legislative process in both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Justice and Equality has a lot of important legislation in his Department. While I do not normally do the work of another Minister, I was delighted to make an exception in this case, and it is great to see the Bill pass today. It will be sent to the President for his signature and I hope it will be law before Christmas. There has been much debate about the benefit of new politics in recent years. This is a prime example of what can be achieved when there is cross-party agreement on an issue and we can all work together on it. I acknowledge the work of Senator Gallagher and Deputy Ó Caoláin. We have worked together on this very closely and we wanted to progress it, as I said, as quickly as possible. I also acknowledge the huge efforts of Mr. Pat Byrne, who produced a documentary to highlight this issue. I recognise the work of Mr. Michael Fisher in narrating the documentary and acknowledge the many local business people, some of whom are here today, who campaigned for this change. It is fair to say this shows the power of documentary. One could sit all day explaining this over and over, but seeing it visually is another matter. The documentary was really good and I think struck a chord with all of us - Senator Gallagher, Deputy Ó Caoláin and me. We all viewed the documentary. I pay tribute to those involved for taking the time to make the documentary. It was very well done. I offer a special thank you to Mr. Donagher, Mr. Byrne and Mr. Fisher because they impressed on us the urgency of the situation.I also thank the Minister for Justice and Equality and his officials, particularly Mr. Seamus Carroll, who prepared the complex narrative I read out earlier. It was complex and I was glad there were no questions on it.

I am content to withdraw this amendment, but I would like some reassurances that the Minister will issue guidance and direction to the new regulator, outside of legislation, that it should have an independent but connected relationship with the approved housing bodies, particularly in the formation of strategy. I am willing to withdraw the amendment once I get those reassurances.

It is good practice to consult on such statements of strategy and that is commonly done. The new Office of the Planning Regulator, which I established earlier this year, had a six-week public consultation process. The Senator mentioned the balance between the independence of a regulatory body and the need for engagement and consultation with the bodies it is regulating, about which I have previously spoken. If, for whatever reason, the new regulator decided not to consult with other bodies, section 23 of the Bill empowers me to direct the regulator to do so. If that direction is not followed, under section 21, my approval is needed before the statement can be published. I cannot imagine that any Minister would allow something like that to be published if it had not gone through the proper consultation first. I hope those assurances are sufficient for the Senator. I appreciate her co-operation on this amendment.

I am satisfied as to the intent of the report, provided it is not used as an opportunity to name and shame an approved housing body without due process and time for that body to put its house in order. I again seek reassurances from the Minister on this matter.

Where allegations are made against a housing body and an investigation is commenced, which may take some time, an interim report would allow some of the clouds hanging over that body to be lifted, at least in terms of public opinion. It might clarify that there are no concerns around financial governance, for example, if that were part of the investigation. Nevertheless, section 47(4) of the Bill allows for parts of an interim report to be omitted if fair procedures relating to the rights of housing bodies to respond to something in the interim report are not followed. I understand the Senator's worry, but the intent is the opposite of what she fears.

We have too many approved housing bodies in this country. It is good that this Government has decided to introduce a method to properly regulate them. There is no doubt that most, if not all, approved housing bodies do a good job. However, I wonder sometimes if it is necessary to have so many, all with CEOs, financial controllers and so on. Perhaps we should be encouraging various such bodies to merge to try to create efficiencies. It is important to have a regulator. Local authorities and the Department are questioned and are held accountable. It is good to see that there will be more oversight of approved housing bodies which get millions of euro in State funding. The Bill is welcome and I thank all parties for their co-operation in passing it.

I try to support them at every stage possible. Regulation is a part of that support and is an important part of what we are trying to do when it comes to housing. I thank my officials for their work in progressing this Bill. I thank Senators for their co-operation, particularly Senator Kelleher for her co-operation with her amendments. It is good to get this regulation in place. I thank those who have been working in a voluntary code in the Housing Agency for the past number of years. Their next phase begins now as they transition from a voluntary regulator to a statutory regulator provided for by this legislation. I wish them well in their work.

St. Vincent's University Hospital advised my Department on 25 September that the person recruited to fill a permanent post of consultant medical oncologist with a special interest in sarcoma would not be taking up the post. The individual was due to commence this position on 1 September. However, on 17 September, human resources at St. Vincent's University Hospital was advised that the individual would not be taking up the post due to personal reasons. St. Vincent's University Hospital is a voluntary hospital that operates its own recruitment policy and has full discretion regarding appointments. The post was re-advertised on 6 October with a closing date of 3 November. I am advised that St. Vincent's University Hospital has completed the short-listing of candidates for the consultant medical oncologist post and that interviews are scheduled for the end of January. Over 200 adults are diagnosed with some form of sarcoma every year in Ireland and it is important that decisions on the management of these cases are made through a multidisciplinary team process. Multidisciplinary teams can involve clinicians and other medical personnel, as well as health and social care professionals, based in several hospitals. The output of their deliberations provide recommendations on the best approach to investigations, treatment and follow-up for the individual patient.  It is important to note that both St. Vincent's University Hospital and Cork University Hospital will continue to provide excellent care for this cohort of patients. A national clinical lead in soft tissue sarcomas is in place and will continue to oversee these services. Patients have their cases presented and discussed at one of the two sarcoma multidisciplinary teams and members of these teams have links with European specialists in sarcoma. St. Vincent's University Hospital and Cork University Hospital are designated cancer centres and have an extensive range of multidisciplinary services and expert clinical advice available. St. Vincent's University Hospital also has access to all of the relevant specialties for treatment, including surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology and pathology. This Government and the Health Service Executive are committed to providing a high-quality, responsive and sustainable service for sarcoma patients. The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 aims to meet the needs of cancer patients in Ireland for the next decade and sets out the plan for the development of cancer services. Effective prevention, early diagnosis, access to quality treatment, survivorship, patient involvement and safe, high-quality, patient-centred care are key aims of the strategy. Services for rare cancers, such as sarcoma, received considerable attention in the development of the strategy. Many rare cancers can be difficult to diagnose and require complex treatment. The importance of improving awareness of rare cancers among both healthcare practitioners and the public is acknowledged. The strategy also identifies the need for clear care pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of patients, with particular emphasis on timely treatment planning at multidisciplinary team level. This includes sub-specialty expertise in diagnosis and treatment with linkages to international centres of excellence for specialist advice and intervention.

I had hoped and expected the Minister for Health to be here but he is not so I guess I will just have to get on with what we have and deal with it. I thank the Leader for organising this debate for today. It is just unfortunate that the Minister is not here. In June 2016, I said in this Chamber: I want to bring to the attention of the House a group that will hold a protest outside the Dáil. It is Sarcoma Action Group Ireland.I made this statement in June 2016. I quoted it because the first point I want to make today is about the unacceptable length of time it has taken to try to sort out this issue. It holds a particular place in my heart because it was the first issue I took on when I got elected.  In July 2016 in his office, the Minister for Health met those seriously ill patients and gave the imprimatur for a specialist sarcoma consultant. The hospital had a wonderful consultant, Dr. Alexia Bertuzzi, but for some reason, the board of the hospital did not see fit to allow her to continue in her locum post or a temporary post moving to a permanent post. The hospital did eventually and reluctantly advertise the post after the Minister gave the imprimatur. It would appear that the management had no intention of following the Minister's instructions. Years of friction at St. Vincent's University Hospital are well known. Perhaps the Minister of State has noted my loss of patience but the loss of patience on the part of patients is more significant and I am their voice in Leinster House. I have been trying to shout about their case for almost four and a half years.  How the whole saga unfolded involved the recruitment process and the members of the hospital's board of management who were possibly professionally vulnerable and could not see that they already had an expert in the country and decided that this person was not fit to fill that role. A lovely man named David Wilkins contacted me and very bravely told me about his struggles. He is in St. Vincent's University Hospital at the moment. He told me about the indignity of being so sick. This year alone, he has had three major surgeries for treatment of sarcoma. His demand is so modest for someone in the midst of such personal struggle. He told me that out of the more than 3,000 consultants in the HSE, all patients want is one specialist.  The second point I wish to make concerns a fundamental flaw regarding this issue. We give millions of euro to St. Vincent's University Hospital and have done so over the decades. According to the HSE's own policies, external recruitment candidates are required to take up duty within three months. I repeat that these candidates must take up duty within three months of receipt of a formal offer of employment.Furthermore, the HSE reserves the right to withdraw an offer of employment should appointees fail to meet these timeframes. However, as the Minister of State noted, St. Vincent's University Hospital stated it is a voluntary hospital which operates its own recruitment and has full discretion over appointments. We are paying it out of public funds. A letter from Ireland East Hospital Group in response to a request for an oncologist stated that recruitment at St. Vincent's University Hospital is conducted in line with legislation and best practice and in accordance with the terms and conditions set down by the HSE. Waiting for two and a half years for a person to take up a post does not fall within the terms and conditions of the HSE. I am sure the panel that was formed, if any, has long since gone out of date. I am unsure whether that could be investigated further. A recruitment process has been started. I urge the Minister of State to go back to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and tell him to ensure an appointment is made in a timely manner because the patients are suffering. There are 200 new cases each year and there is no specialist in the hospital. I am unsure whether that constitutes neglect of duty by the hospital or whether the families of the patients who have died have any recourse. The duty of care is not being taken seriously. I hope a candidate is speedily recruited. I have waited more than four years for that to happen, as have the patients. There is something rotten somewhere. I will not state where I think it is, but the Minister of State will probably be able to guess at that from my response. I ask him to, please, protect these patients. The role of a Minister of Health is to protect public health and patients' interests. He needs to slap down with a hard hand and get this appointment done.

I support her on this matter. I have had the benefit of meeting families advocating for loved ones regarding the issue of a sarcoma national clinical lead specialist. To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Harris, cannot be here and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is present in his stead. I understand the frustration of Senator Devine. This is a very important situation. We can dress it up whatever way we like, but what happened is very disappointing. As Senator Devine stated, a doctor was in situ but, at the 11th hour, not reappointed for some reason. The person due to take up the position did not do so. Senators may get all the emails in the world and make speeches in the House, but it is only when one meets people who explain their family situation-----

I do not mean that disrespectfully. All Senators have experience of dealing with issues involving cancer, such as family members who died or loved ones who, thankfully, recovered. It is when one meets people face to face that one understands they are trying to be advocates and ensure specialist treatment is available for their son, daughter, father in law, mother in law or other loved one. It appears that the post was filled by a very thorough and professional expert who was not given the job. Another person was offered the job but did not take it. If one has cancer, one goes to see a doctor who specialises in that cancer, be it breast cancer, prostate cancer or sarcoma. Many of those affected by this issue are children. The national cancer strategy has worked quite well. We all have an opportunity to effect change. The national cancer strategy has done a significant amount. The Minister of State mentioned that Cork University Hospital and St. Vincent's are centres of excellence. The gravity of the situation is brought home through the experience of meeting those affected and receiving emails from them. I know from the response of the Minister of State and from engaging on behalf of people that the job has been readvertised and St. Vincent's has drawn up a shortlist. We cannot allow a situation such as this to happen again. There must be no groundhog day. The patients travel to St. Vincent's from various parts of the country. We need to restore confidence and put in place a pathway and continuum of care. The appointment of a medical oncologist with sarcoma expertise is the key factor in so doing. The Minister, Deputy Harris, met advocacy groups and sarcoma patients and approved funding for the position in St. Vincent's but unfortunately, as Senator Devine stated, some of the patients have gone to their eternal reward, while others have come to us to advocate and champion this issue. I commend the Senator on the role she has played. It is because she raised the matter in the Seanad that people came to me on it having seen the transcript of proceedings. That was the reason for my meeting family representatives. Our bona fides are that we are speaking on behalf of patients and their families. This is not a political matter put forward by Fine Gael or Sinn Féin. Rather, it is being raised by individual Senators who have met families and people who benefited from the clinical lead with expertise in sarcoma. We want such expertise to be available at St. Vincent's.

I share their frustration and, in particular, the frustration and concerns of patients. I wish to confirm that in September St. Vincent's University Hospital was advised that the selected consultant medical oncologist with a special interest in sarcoma would not be taking up the post for personal reasons. As St. Vincent's is a voluntary hospital, it operates its own recruitment policy and has full discretion regarding appointments. Although I understand that patients may be frustrated by the delay in the role being filled, I am advised that it was readvertised with a closing date of 3 November. The hospital has completed the shortlisting of candidates and intends to hold interviews at the end of January with a view to ensuring that a suitable individual is appointed as soon as possible. Of course, I will bring the Senators' concerns back to the Minister, Deputy Harris. I assure Senator Devine that, in the meantime, high quality service will continue to be delivered to sarcoma patients by St. Vincent's hospital through its multidisciplinary team with oversight by the national clinical lead in soft tissue sarcoma.
