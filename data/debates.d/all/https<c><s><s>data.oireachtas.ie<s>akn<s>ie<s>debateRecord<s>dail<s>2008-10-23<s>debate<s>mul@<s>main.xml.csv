#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek leave under Standing Order 32 to have the business of the Dáil adjourned to discuss a matter of urgent importance, namely, the impact of the withdrawal from Protestant fee paying schools of the support services grant, the unilateral breaking of the formal agreement between former Minister Donogh O'Malley and Church of Ireland bishops representing all Protestant faith based schools, the effective deprivation of disadvantaged Protestant faith children from receiving an education within the ethos chosen by their parents, given that the number of such schools in the State is limited to 21 in just 13 counties, and that for a paltry saving the Minister has arbitrarily ended the long-standing acceptance of the necessity to facilitate Protestant ethos education for disadvantaged children of that faith.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of local and national importance, namely, the fact the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Health Service Executive have totally reneged on their commitment and their guarantee to the people of Monaghan that no service would be removed from Monaghan General Hospital until a service as good or better would be available.  This very day the management is calling in the unions and later all of the personnel working there to advise what the future will hold for them.  I have no doubt from the statements made by senior personnel that if nothing is done through this House, those meetings will have a serious negative effect on the people of Monaghan.  In recent times Cavan General Hospital has had to send its patients home before it was prudent or sensible and major questions have still to be answered over some of these cases.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda had to be taken off call and all this before 58 beds were removed.  This is an emergency.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that parliamentary questions next for answer by the Taoiseach on EU matters shall be taken on the same day as the statements on EU Council meeting, Brussels, scheduled to be taken on Wednesday, 29 October 2008, and shall be moved to be taken first as ordinary oral questions to the Taoiseach on that day.  The Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 October 2008.

Is the proposal that the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 October agreed to?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It is not agreed.  Proposal No. 2 proposes the Dáil shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday next, 29 October.  We have a bank holiday on Monday, but that is fine because we would not expect to sit on Monday anyway.  However, I see no justification for us not sitting on Tuesday.  Whatever about not sitting on Tuesday, there is even less justification for not sitting until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday.I am aware it has been the tradition and practice down the years that when we have a bank holiday, the House does not sit the day after, but these are not normal times.  Financial markets are still in a state of flux and people are still very concerned about what is happening with the economy.  We had 15,000 pensioners outside the House yesterday who remain unhappy, as do the thousands of others who were not there, with the position regarding the medical card.  We also had 15,000 students outside who are unhappy about the Government planning to reintroduce tuition fees.In my reading of the schedule for next week's truncated business in the House, I see no provision made for the continuation of the debate on the budget.  When one takes out the statements on the European summit that are proposed for Wednesday and the arrangements for Private Members' Business, there are only two hours for other business planned for next week.  This is in exceptional times.  Many issues arise from the budget and only five of the Labour Party Members have had the opportunity to speak so far.  There are 20 Members of the Labour Party in the House, all of whom would like to speak on the budget and raise issues such as cuts in disability payments and in education.  I heard Deputy Gogarty's letter to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, yesterday, in which he tells us that class sizes are the biggest issue.  We will debate that next week.

That is a daft proposal in these times and circumstances.  I ask the Government to have the House back here at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, the normal meeting time.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20311	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	13	There is an expectation that the Dáil would sit next week to deal with many issues that have been thrown up not only by the budget.  They are not only the issues in the public domain.  A significant legislative programme derives from the budget, including legislation to rationalise many agencies.  The House will want to participate in that legislation.

We have limited opportunity to address issues within the constituency and on a public holiday local authorities and public sector employees are not at work.  However, Deputy Gilmore has put a compelling case, which is the critical point we must take on board.  I wish to explain it is not Deputies taking an extra day, which is an unfair representation.  Deputies of all parties work exceptionally hard and have responsibilities in their constituencies.  We should not be afraid to make that point.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I have no idea who on the Government side is badgering away.  If he has nothing else to say he has very little to contribute.  I am trying to reflect on a factual situation.  I again make the point that Deputy Gilmore's remarks make a compelling case.  In the circumstances he has rightly highlighted we should at the very least schedule our sitting for next week at the normal commencement time for a Wednesday morning.  That is the very least that should be expected of us.  My party and I personally would have no objection if we were to set aside the normal practice for a day following a public holiday and to schedule business for Tuesday.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20311	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	32	How does the Government intend to give legislative effect to two commitments it made yesterday?  The first is to index the income limits for medical cards, which was not the practice in recent years, but I understand that is now Government policy.  The second is to provide that no more than 5% of those aged over 70 will lose their medical cards.  What legislative vehicle will be used for this?  Will it be provided for in the Social Welfare Bill?I refer to competition and consumer legislation.  The Government did not increase tax credits for next year, a levy will be imposed on the low paid and it has piled on many charges on the lower paid.  At the same time, there is strong evidence of rip offs in consumer markets.  We have been told to expect the merger of the Competition Authority with the National Consumer Agency.  Against a background, for example, where the price of diesel pre-tax has increased by 18% in Ireland with no corresponding increase in Europe over the same six-month period, when will the legislation be introduced to give effect to a stronger consumer-competition agency in order that we can have confidence these rip offs will be tackled by Government?  Another rip off mooted in today's newspapers is an increase in the cost of motor insurance.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	33	On the medical cards, to give effect to Government policy it will be necessary to provide in legislation for both the repeal of section 1 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 and the withdrawal of eligibility from those currently in possession of medical cards under the Act whose income is above the threshold announced by the Government on Tuesday.  This issue was raised by our colleagues in the Labour Party on the basis of the Interpretation Act, but that does not arise.There has been an announcement to the effect that, in respect of those over 70 years of age, the thresholds will be annually reviewed to take cost of living increases into account during the Government's lifetime.  A legislative measure is unnecessary.On the Competition Authority——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20311	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Is the Tánaiste saying that a legislative measure is unnecessary?  This matter is mainly provided for by legislation.

Legislation covers the work of both.  As the Deputy knows, I have requested that the NCA carry out work regarding the prices of diesel and petrol, an issue that has not only been expressed in the House, but by many consumers.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20311	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The situation has worsened since the Government's announcement.

I also gave an undertaking to change the legislation, given the Government's decision on medical cards.  I am addressing the issue and I hope to have a firm decision on the required legislative proposals shortly.

The Tánaiste stated that two legislative measures will be required.  The first will be a measure to repeal section 1 of the 2001 Act and the second will be required to withdraw the medical cards.  Will these measures be made by way of separate legislation or does it remain the intention to include them in the social welfare Bill?If the Government is introducing legislative measures to withdraw the medical cards from pensioners, why will it not legislatively underpin the commitment it supposedly gave yesterday to the effect that means test limits will be index linked?  What of the arrangements for the social welfare Bill?  From previous statements, I understood that the measures withdrawing the medical cards would be included in that Bill.  Subsequently, we were told of some type of odd arrangement whereby the social welfare Bill would be introduced by two Ministers, one part by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the other part by the Minister for Health and Children.  Will the issue be explained?

When will the Christmas bonus be paid to pensioners?  It is not guaranteed in legislation.  Will provision be made in the Social Welfare Bill for the payment of the bonus?

It is a complex item of legislation.  As a result of the budget being brought forward, we will have little time to study it.  As usual, it will probably contain nuggets for Fianna Fáil's friends in the development community.

What is the situation in regard to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the provision for corporate social responsibility in the banking scheme?  People are losing their jobs and have nowhere to go for advice on their mortgages.

If everybody did the same as Deputy Burton, the Order of Business would last until tomorrow night.  I have called Deputy Higgins.

The Irish Banking Federation was made responsible for the scheme.  People have nowhere to go for advice and assistance.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	135	When will the designated land (housing development) Bill be taken?  This is the so-called "use it or lose it" legislation to deal with land banks that have been lying idle.On two occasions, I introduced legislation amending section 4 of the Competition Act.  In both instances, the legislation was voted down by the Government on the basis that the review of competition legislation was not complete.  The Tánaiste has announced her intention to amend the Competition Act.  Will she publish a timetable for the legislative programme that flows from the agreement with the social partners, which includes collective bargaining rights and reform of section 4 of the Competition Act?  If she wishes, for example, to take unto herself and the Government the right to negotiate in good faith, she could have accepted either of the two Labour Party Bills.  She is now suggesting she will be able to take this power, but she has not indicated how she will do so.  Will there be a comprehensive reform of the Competition Act which addresses section 4?  If the Tánaiste does not provide clarity on this, she is simply saying she will have a sideways negotiation with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, without being able to deal with the comprehensive issue, namely, that the Competition Act struck down collective rights agreed in trade union legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Deputy is referring to two types of legislation.  In regard to the agreement with the social partners, we very much welcome the decision by SIPTU and the affirmation by the EU regarding temporary agency workers.  At this moment in time, we are in discussions with the social partners on a timeframe for the implementation of some of that legislation.  However, I am not in a position to provide a date as to when that legislation will be brought forward.  Once the discussions have been completed, we will bring forward the legislation as quickly as possible.The Competition Act is a different issue.  A review of that legislation is under way.  The Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency are to be amalgamated.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	137	That is a different issue.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	138	It is all the same issue.  I do not intend to waste people's time by introducing three or four items of legislation when the best approach may be to introduce a single Bill.  I am very cognisant of the existence of EU competition law and of the fact that my decisions must be made in that context, with advice from the Attorney General.   Arising from the discussions with the IMO, I gave a political undertaking to amend the Competition Act.  I stand over that commitment.  We are dealing with a complex item of legislation.  At the moment, I am trying to determine whether it would be best to incorporate the issues arising from the IMO decision in the existing legislation or to introduce additional legislation.  My preferred option is to have one piece of legislation which would facilitate the review, the new instruments I wish to introduce and the amalgamation of the two authorities.  I will speak to the Deputy privately once I have made that determination.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I look forward to that.  However, the Tánaiste is saying she will take it upon herself to negotiate with the IMO without dealing with the collective bargaining issue which is at the heart of section 4 of the Act.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I am not.

It is disconcerting given that in the last week, we have had many different moments in time.  What she is signalling for the future has no certainty.The Tánaiste stated in the Dáil yesterday that the legality of any legislation, changes to it and requirements within this House are done with the best legal advice from the Attorney General.  In regard to the proposed repeal of section 1 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 and the other facilitating legislation she has indicated this morning, what does her statement of yesterday mean?  Has the Government yet received advice from the Attorney General?  Did the Government seek his advice on the legislative measures necessary to give effect to——

Very often, it generates a repetitive editorial.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, did so in the past few days.Will the Tánaiste indicate when that Bill will come before this House?  Also, will she acknowledge this is an urgent necessity particularly in the area of sex crimes?  The Garda Síochána are fighting criminals and conducting investigations with their hands tied behind their backs because we have no DNA database in respect of, for example, released sex offenders within the community.

Perhaps the Tánaiste might clarify that.The post-budget legislation that is now required and effectively promised arising from the budget contains at least 17 separate legislative measures as far as we can identify.  It would seem absolutely impossible to avoid creating a legislative porridge and total mess where nobody could find anything in legislation unless there is separate legislation on each item.  The schedule we got — usually a fair work of fiction anyway — can now be totally discarded because of the necessity for the Government to implement these 17 pieces of legislation.Has the Government given any thought to giving us a new schedule arising from the need for 17 pieces of legislation, a record, to be introduced in the short term to implement the budget.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Last night I spoke on the cuts affecting the elderly and today I will concentrate on the education cutbacks and how we have failed our children.  Yesterday we saw a large protest against third-level fees, with 10,000 students assembling outside Leinster House.  Every level of education has been affected by the budget, including second-level and primary education.To be parochial for a moment, we all know the problems in Ennis national school, where there are 14 prefabricated buildings.  A new school has been promised for a long time and yet there is no movement on it.  We are at the stage now where both primary and secondary school students are reduced to packing bags in shops in order to fund much-needed facilities in schools throughout the country, despite the fact we have had ten years of unprecedented wealth.  Our education system is surviving on a shoestring.The significant decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio adds further pressure.  Yesterday and today I have been inundated with e-mails and telephone calls from concerned parents whose children are in Tulla national school.  It is one of eight schools in east Clare where the pupil-teacher ratio has been increased; in September 2008 it had 261 pupils with ten teachers and in September 2009 it will have 270 pupils with nine teachers, a ratio of 30:1.  The same can be said for St. Flannan's College in Ennis, where they are operating with a reduction of five teachers and Coláiste Muire in Ennis, where the Oireachtas Members in Clare will have a meeting tomorrow.  It has seen a reduction of four teachers.  Every school in Clare will suffer.The children struggling at school who need additional help will be particularly affected and left behind.  In west Clare there is a primary school with temporary accommodation for children with autism which has six pupils.  I have had a number of phone calls from parents who are concerned about follow-up education for those students because facilities are not there in secondary schools.The Minister claims the pupil-teacher ratio is only increasing by one pupil but the Government must understand that many of these schools are operating above the optimum level anyway.  Not alone are we facing an increase in class sizes but we are also being hit by children's needs in other areas.  The 32 cuts were highlighted by our own spokesperson, Deputy Brian Hayes.  In times of economic slowdown, we should be investing in our children's future.I will turn to the failure of Government to meet the concerns of the needy.  With the 1% income levy, the original proposal was to target all sections of society, including pensioners, the lower paid and those on the minimum wage.  Fortunately, after a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and in an effort to save the national wage agreement, the Minister rolled back on the issue and excluded those on the minimum wage, up to €17,540 a year.Many people on the minimum wage must work overtime because they are on such low wages.  They will have to pay the levy if they work overtime.  Many small businesses depend on the level of overtime being worked by employees and under this proposal, workers will be penalised.  This will also result in a loss of production.I have limited time on the issue but I will speak about the failure of the Government with regard to the regions.  In particular, this relates to the €10 travel tax, which will affect passengers travelling through Shannon Airport.  It is an unfair tax which was clearly put in with an agenda for Dublin.  As far as I can see, other Irish airports do not appear on the radar.  The tax is inequitable and unfair and I hope the Minister will withdraw it.  Ryanair has issued a warning that it will reduce services through Shannon.Shannon Development got a grant each year of €3 million, which has now been reduced to €700,000.  In other words, Shannon Development will now have to take a sum out of its own budget.  I know it is a self-financing company but will its marketing be affected or will there be job losses?  What restructuring will go on in Shannon Development?  This is a blow to regions which have already experienced a number of blows and job losses.I wish to talk about farmers before I conclude because the farming community has been badly hit in respect of installation aid and the farm retirement and suckler cow schemes.  A huge problem exists in this regard and farmers will rebel like the students and old age pensioners did yesterday.  As my time has expired, I will revert to this issue at some other time.  However this budget is both bad and failed and will affect all sectors of society, the middle classes and businesses.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I almost was going to ask who told the Ceann Comhairle I was from Tallaght.  First, I thank him for giving me the opportunity to make my brief contribution to this important debate.  I am mindful that Members and the Ceann Comhairle have had a long morning.  School groups from Athboy, Tipperary, Blackrock and Ringsend have been visiting the Gallery this morning and I am sure they all have been fascinated by what is going on.  While I am sorry there were no visitors from Tallaght, it is good to have young people in the Gallery to witness the business of the House.Other colleagues have spoken of the different political times in which we find ourselves.  It occurred to me yesterday that I have been around these streets for a long time.  I sometimes remark that I am not from where people assume, as I was born around these parts, attended school in Clarendon Street and lived in Stephen Street.  I am not afraid to admit the streets of Dublin yesterday were a different place.  This morning, I reflected that Members often have seen groups on the streets such as teachers, nurses, doctors, farmers and anti-war protesters.  I am a proud Dubliner but to my knowledge, the kind of scenes witnessed yesterday were unprecedented.  While the students' protest was to be expected, the number of elderly people was not.  I am not afraid to make this point from the Fianna Fáil benches as my mother and grandmother, who came from these parts, would wish it.Members should reflect on what happened over the past week.  This morning, instead of coming in on the Luas, as I often try to do, I drove in for other reasons.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern, who is present, will be pleased to hear it did not take me very long.  While so doing, I had the opportunity to listen to "The Tubridy Show" on RTE Radio 1, as I often do.  Ryan Tubridy conducted an excellent interview for more than half an hour with the great Frank Kelly, who is known for his work on "Wanderly Wagon", "Father Ted" and so on.  It was an amazing, up-to-date and relevant discussion on the times we are in.  I am sure Frank Kelly will not object to me stating that he made the point that he would have hoped those politicians who went out to address the protestors would have been allowed to speak.  While I merely repeat his remarks, and not in a demeaning way, he made a fair point in this regard.  I listened carefully to the interview, in which highly relevant points were made about the kind of day that was experienced in Dublin yesterday and on the reasons people were out on the streets to protest.I always have been strongly in favour of the citizenship model.  Without being flippant, I often have observed that I was not born a politician.  I became involved in politics through becoming upset and agitated about different issues that affected my community when I moved to Tallaght.  People encouraged me, which is how I became involved in politics.  I will not forget where I am from and will not forget the issues that are of concern to my community.  The Ceann Comhairle is aware that, in so far as is possible, I spend all day, every day in my constituency.  Over the past week, I certainly have not hidden away.  I have been out on the streets and in the shopping centres, including the Square, as well as outside the schools in my constituency.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	359	It is important that politicians should get out and listen to the serious concerns of and upset felt by people, who have been frustrated and confused.  Father Frank Herron will not object to me stating that he was in my presence on Saturday when a man accused me of taking away his medical card.  However, I knew from his circumstances that this was not true and that he will not lose his medical card.  While I do not suggest there are no political issues to be dealt with, as there are, there was much confusion, which drew the frustration, anger and upset.  People genuinely believed, having listened to the hype, that they would lose their medical cards.  As Members now know, many of them will not.  However, that was the perception and politics is about perception.One must get across the message and try to be more positive.  I certainly will continue to listen to people in my constituency, which is the reason I spend so much time in Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue, Brittas and Bohernabreena.  Having listened to the debate in recent days, it is clear all my other colleagues also listen to what people have to say.  Incidentally, although people are positive about some matters, there has been much upset in the past week.  Together with other colleagues, I am not afraid to apologise for the upset that has been caused to people in my constituency and the wider Dublin region, because it is important to do so.  I am glad the Government, of which I am a member and supporter, recognised the mistake that was made.In common with other colleagues, I acknowledge the many messages I have received in the form of personal calls, e-mails and letters from throughout the region and from further afield.  Together with other colleagues, I received many e-mails from counties Donegal, Sligo, Kildare, Waterford and Kerry, which is fair enough.  I heard a colleague observe this morning that this issue has put much pressure on our offices.  To be fair, my staff, in so far as possible, has tried to respond rapidly, although there always will be those who tell one that one failed to get back to them.Like Deputy Crawford, I was a delegate to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly over the weekend, which was an amazing experience about which I will talk on another occasion.  However, I took a call from RTE in Newcastle, appeared on the "Today with Pat Kenny" radio programme presented by Myles Dungan and made the points I now am reiterating in this contribution.  People rang me to thank me for at least responding to and recognising the upset created by this episode.  While I will not get into the argument raised by Deputy Gallagher last night about who said what to the Government, I certainly took my role as a backbencher very seriously.  I conveyed to the party leadership, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and my colleagues the issues that were being brought to my attention.  Arising from that listening experience, I hope the decisions taken over the weekend and beyond in respect of the medical card and income levy issues were in response to what people were saying to Members.  Everyone has a role to play in this regard and I am satisfied to have taken that role.I am a Dáil Deputy and like everyone else, I was asked whether I would walk out of the party and resign.  I was gratified when many of my constituents told me they concurred with my view in this regard.  I stated that when I was elected in 2002 and 2007, people obviously voted for me for all sorts of reasons, including personal ones, although I am not as popular as many other Members.  They certainly voted for me because of my community endeavours.  However, as I stated on George Hook's radio programme, those who voted for me were clear that I was a Fianna Fáil Deputy who was under the Fianna Fáil banner and that is my position.  While I am not commenting on any other colleague, I strongly believe that one sticks to one's tasks and focuses on the issues.  One should have the courage to bring matters to the attention of one's party leadership, both before the parliamentary party and in other conversations, and one tries to correct things that were done wrongly.  I am glad we have made progress in that regard in the past week.  Without being flippant, one could state, "a lot done, more to do", but I will continue to represent the issues that are brought to my attention and that is important work for me.Although the budget announced last week triggered all sorts of reactions, it included items such as the announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, of an increase in benefits, as well as ideas and proposals for protecting young homeowners.  He spoke about caring for families and children and keeping Ireland working.  It is fair enough for the Opposition to claim that the current financial crisis is all the Government's fault, but Sky News in England puts the blame on the UK Government and CNN in America blames the US Government.  I will not argue with those claims except to point out that a global crisis clearly exists.  It is important we demonstrate that Ireland remains open for business.  We must continue to go about our business in terms of using public transport as much as possible, visiting places of entertainment and eating and drinking in various premises.  Last Sunday, I took some stick in my local pub, Molloys in Tallaght village.  The place was packed, which was a good sign in these difficult financial times.  Somebody asked why people were giving out to me, given that I visited the pub every Sunday at lunchtime to buy a Lotto ticket and drink a mineral.  It is important that we get across that positive message.The budget set out strong policies to ensure Ireland keeps working.  I have often discussed the need for job creation.  Each of the 166 Members of this House can speak about the need for job creation in his or her constituency.  I am not afraid to speak up for my area of Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the State after Dublin and Cork.  The area has a very young population and has great educational facilities, including an institute of technology, which are turning out people who are looking for jobs.  We have always faced challenges in Tallaght in terms of job creation.  I was a founder member, in 1984, of the Get Tallaght Working Co-operative, which has become Partas enterprise group, which promotes job creation through the enterprise centres in Killinarden, Brookfield and Bolbrook.  I have stressed the importance of job creation with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, and I will continue to do so.  Happily, my town has made progress in that regard but we are now facing into challenging times and unemployment is growing in all regions.  This morning over breakfast, I read an article in the Tallaght Echo on unemployment and the challenges it brings.  I can bring to my politics the experience of being made redundant on three separate occasions and I know what it is like to tell one’s wife and children that one has lost a job.It is important, however, not only to look ahead for other employment opportunities but also to provide help and support.  Even in tight times, the Department of Social and Family Affairs must continue to respond to these challenges.  My colleagues spoke to newspapers about delays in the Department and I articulated similar concerns on behalf of my constituents.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs should send a positive message by ensuring that her Department deals with claims promptly and sympathetically.  Constituents express concern that their claims are being delayed.  Many young people find the back to education allowance and other schemes somewhat restrictive given the pressures they are facing.  A balance must be struck in considering people who are under pressure and the current economic difficulties.  The best way to look after people who are facing financial difficulties is to find them employment and I will continue to do that in respect of my town.Good times are coming to Tallaght with the extension of the Luas, which has been a great success, to the west Tallaght estates of Fettercairn, Brookfield and Ardmore, and on toCitywest.  This project will help people to access jobs and services.The opening next February of the Tallaght stadium will also create employment.  We are looking forward to the relocation of Shamrock Rovers to Tallaght.  This season I have followed the team at every opportunity and when I attended Tolka Park last week I had an opportunity while walking along Drumcondra Road to speak with my good friend, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He calmed me down regarding the issues that have arisen.  I was delighted to see him in the House last night and I wish him well.  The role played by the Ceann Comhairle in developing the new stadium is widely recognised in Tallaght.  During a recent function at which Shamrock Rovers won a special award from the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce for the work it is doing with Brookfield school, his efforts were acknowledged.  I look forward to his visit to the stadium at some point in the future.I am glad we made progress on medical cards and dealt with the concerns that arose regarding the income levy.  I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach that people earning less than the minimum wage of €17,542 will be exempt from the 1% levy.  It was important for the Government to heed ICTU and those politicians, particularly on the Fianna Fáil and Green Party backbenches, who brought these issues to its attention.Some say the next focus for the Government will be on education.  I will not wait until next week before I suddenly start highlighting the need for Government investment in and support for education.  I raise this issue constantly.  Yesterday, I put down parliamentary questions on the need for a building programme in Our Lady's secondary school, Templeogue, further accommodation in Holy Rosary primary school in Ballycraugh, Tallaght, and the need to staff the physical education halls in Killinarden and Firhouse.  I speak about education on a regular basis and try to represent all the schools in my area.  St. Mark's primary school in my parish of Springfield has 1,000 pupils, 500 of whom come from 44 international communities.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, will join me in stressing the importance of educational facilities.  In Springfield, where I live, I can make a special case.  As this debate develops and teachers, parents and school communities make the case, it is important that all of us listen to what people say.  When I am invited to meetings, I will attend.  When I am invited to listen to parents, teachers and pupils, I will be there.  It is important that we do that.  It has been a difficult week politically but politics is not about the good times.  I did not come into politics to enjoy myself, I came in to take the knocks and focus on issues of interest to my community.There is always time for party politics.  I am not looking at Deputy Rabbitte when I say that, but while communities respect that we must play politics, they hope we can work together on issues of concern.  As we work through the issues arising from the budget and the campaigns that will arise on educational issues, people will expect us to make political points but also to work together, and it is important that we do so.I refer to the Age Action Ireland campaign on fuel poverty.  I am the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  I chaired a session that was rather timely last Wednesday when we welcomed Age Action Ireland.  The delegation spoke about medical cards but I have already mentioned that a number of times.  The delegation focused on fuel poverty.  At a time of difficulty, it is important that we make the case, and there is a case to be addressed and to be answered on this matter.  Age Action Ireland would want me to do that and there was all-party support for the points made in that regard.There has been much media focus on the issues mentioned over the past week.  Medical cards struck the imagination and people also talked about the income levy and education — party leaders have said that this will be the next issue on the agenda.  From the Government benches, I hope that in the midst of all this we do not forget other interest groups and issues of concern.  In a particular way I support the case made by the Disability Federation of Ireland, a strong lobby.  There has been much lobbying by many groups and many pre-budget submissions, including by groups in Tallaght in my constituency, such as the Tallaght Welfare Society.  The society had strong views on the issues mentioned and on pensions, which have been parked in the midst of other issues.  We should do our utmost to support the points of view expressed on disability and mental health services.  The Disability Federation of Ireland needs to maintain its lobby, ensuring that as far as possible in difficult times account is taken of its needs.  I expect that will continue to be a matter we will focus on for some time.

They are all on my desk, in the basket, and I am not afraid to speak up from the Government benches on the issues that are of concern to me.  I hope Deputy Rabbitte does not think I am patronising him when I refer to my presence at St. Dominic's Church, Tallaght, where he gave a fine address to the annual hope commemoration for those who have been affected by drugs.There is a danger that while some issues grab the headlines — we have had a week of media hype about issues that are of concern to people — others are unmentioned.  That includes the point about disability and drugs difficulties and abuse, an issue that affects many groups.  In my constituency, the Swan Family Support Group and the Tallaght Rehabilitation Project, whose boards I am on, have made the point that they cannot be forgotten in the midst of everything else.  I am a member of the Tallaght drugs task force, with Deputies Rabbitte and Brian Hayes.  We are entitled to our politics but it is important that the community sees we are fighting the cause on these issues and are not afraid to raise them.  I spoke to every Minister I could find this week and discussed with the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, Deputy John Curran, the concerns we are trying to articulate.  It is important to give attention to the issues that are not getting attention.There will be always be lobbying.  My mailbox is full this morning and my desk is full of e-mails, including some from Limerick.  I do not know if Deputy O'Donnell gets some from Tallaght.

I do not know if Deputy O'Donnell was here when I made this point so I will repeat that politics is not just for the good times.  One must learn to deal with the bad times.I have said it more than once in this contribution that I bring my life experiences to politics.  This includes living through difficult times.  I lived through the late 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and so on.  I had to look for a job, I had to emigrate and I might be living in London today were it not for the fact that I got homesick.  Deputy O'Donnell would not have the opportunity to have a go at me if I was across in London doing something completely different.  I came home, got a job in difficult times and each time I lost my job through no fault of my own, which might happen again, I kept my head down and focused on what I was doing and what I wanted to achieve.

I am clear about the upset, frustration and anger that exists in my community.  I have been talking to and listening to people.  When they wanted to have a go at me, I took it because that is important.  I am not afraid to represent the concerns that people bring to my attention.  It is important that we are having this debate.As far as my difficult work schedule has allowed, I have listened to as much of the debate as possible.  I accept, as the nice Deputy across the House said, that I am sitting on the Government benches and that is where I will stay because I do not believe that being outside the tent is the way to get the job done.  I will continue to represent bravely all the issues that are brought to me by all my constituents and community groups.  If people are looking for me over the next couple days or over the bank holiday weekend, they should come out to Tallaght, Templeogue, Greenhills and Firhouse and they will find me easily enough.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I wish to share time with Deputy Jack Wall.It is difficult to reply to this budget because it is a moving target.  The remarks of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who introduced it, ought to be mentioned as a starting point.  He said that it was "no less than a call to patriotic action".  If ever there was a more inappropriate call to the flag, I cannot recall it.  To summon in this cavalier fashion people who paid their taxes all their working lives and ask them to surrender their medical cards in the name of patriotic action was a colossal act of misjudgment.  The people affected have done their patriotic duty by the State in good times and bad.  Now the Government repays them by taking away the peace of mind provided by the medical card in their twilight years.  It will not be forgotten for a long time that the response of every man and woman of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government to the exhortation of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was to rise in their seats to applaud this callous misjudgment.Prominent among them were the two Green Party Ministers who boasted before and after publication of the Budget Statement of their input into the decision making and of how proud they were of solidarity in Government.  However, after Deputy Joe Behan jumped ship and the revolt by the Fianna Fáil backbenchers began, the Green Party tried to get in on the act.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, told RTE last Sunday that he was happy to wait and see what solution the Taoiseach would come up with before the Green Party would give it their blessing.  He sounded like the Queen at Balmoral, summoning her Prime Minister for a scolding.  The Taoiseach might be forgiven if he gave the Minister, Deputy Gormley, a black eye.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Nobody denies that the country is facing the worst economic circumstances in a generation and only the most partisan would deny that the crisis is of the Government's own making.  Time and again the Minister for Finance pledged, in his speech and beforehand, that his guiding principle would be the protection of the vulnerable and what he called "the little people".It is a cause for concern if the Minister believes that his budget protects the weak, the poor and the vulnerable.Following are some of the ways the budget impacts on the weakest in our society.  Those aged over 70 are to be divested of their medical card and the working poor must pay a 1 % levy.  Language support teachers are to be capped at two, irrespective of the number of migrant children and the pupil-teacher ratio is to go back to 28:1.  DIRT for small savers will rise to 23% to 26%.  There will be reduced grants for adult education, reductions in the provision for people with disabilities and cutbacks in education provision for Traveller children.  There will be no increase in child benefit and the third level registration fee will go up from €900 to €1,500.  The fuel poverty issue will be addressed by an increase of €2 in fuel allowance.  It is cynical in the extreme for any Government to claim that these are the actions of a Government trying to protect the little people .
My good friend, Deputy Charlie O'Connor, has raised an example as if he were on the Opposition benches.  A school in the heart of my constituency, in Springfield, has 536 pupils, 258 of whom do not speak English.  Apart from the obvious necessity to bring these children up to speed in the language, we can imagine the impact on the indigenous children if the newcomers are not assisted.  What is the outcome of the budget for this school which is typical of so many?  It is to experience the loss of five teachers, four language support teachers and one other teacher because the retention levels will not measure up next September.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	375	How can anyone argue that a cap of two support teachers is justified, irrespective of the size of the school or the number of non-national children?  The decision to abandon the effort to improve the pupil-teacher ratio and to take a significant step backwards has properly provoked strenuous protests from teacher leaders who have tended heretofore to be supportive of the Government.  Far from protecting the little people , this decision literally makes the children pay for the recession.I feel especially angry at the savage increase in the third level registration fee from €900 to €1,500,  which will kill off the ambition to go to third level in many working-class homes that are not recipients of grants.  It appears that the campaign to reintroduce fees is determined to succeed.In this regard it is instructive to look again at the Minister's words on budget day.  He made it perfectly plain that the Government is rethinking such universal provision as we now enjoy when he stated: "Universal entitlement irrespective of means does not target those in greatest need.....  I am proposing in the budget this year to initiate action in this direction in some areas.”It is clear that the Government is not satisfied to abolish automatic entitlement to the medical card.  It seems to be the intention, for example, that once again third level education will become mainly the preserve of those who can afford it.  The Minister made clear that he intends to tackle universal provision and this was the point picked up by Deputy Behan.  There are very few areas in our society where there is universal provision and it seems that third level tuition fees will be the next call.The Minister went out of his way to put on the record that he "expects that the Commission on Taxation will examine options relating to the tax treatment of universal child benefit payments".  There is a great deal in this budget that requires to be teased out, that, because of the understandable protests about the Government removing the medical card from pensioners, has been hidden away.  He stated very plainly, and I quote him again, that he "expects that the Commission on Taxation will examine options relating to the tax treatment of universal child benefit payments".With respect to the medical card, if it is true that there are 20,000 millionaires aged over 70, an extraordinary number given that there are supposed to be 33,000 millionaires in the population as a whole, it will cost almost as much to administer the agreement the Government has put in place, or believes it has put in place, than it would to permit the universal provision of access to primary care on the basis of need rather than on the basis that people can afford it.One has to keep an eye on the monitor.  The first proposal was that we would have a four-tier system, the first category being old age pensioners with the medical card, the second those with the GP-only card, the third those with the €400 and the fourth those with no entitlement.  Can anybody imagine the means test nightmare that system will involve for a Health Service Executive that cannot administer what it is charged with as it stands?  After the climb-down what the Government proposes is a means test that will cost as much as the €16 million odd it will save.How did we get into this mess? We know that the medical card fiasco is another Mícheál Martin special.  This is the Minister who negotiated the contract with GPs that is now deemed unaffordable, the same Minister who could have saved €111 million on the nursing home over-payments scandal if only he had read his brief, the same Minister who put hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money into the health service without any reforms or value for money considerations.  In which other democratic country would this man still be a Minister?I sought to raise the following matter with the Tánaiste this morning but she coyly stepped away from it.  I understand from some doctors that the agreement the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, signed with general practitioners in respect of medical cards for those aged over 70 years includes a term which disallows the Government from changing the contract without the express permission of the Irish Medical Organisation.  I have never heard of a government ceding its sovereign right to act as it sees fit.  Despite signing this term in the contract, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is still swanning around the place making eyes at higher office.No one who knows anything about Irish history and politics will have been surprised that the doctors triumphed at the expense of the taxpayer because they have done so on previous occasions.  It was, however, the duty of the then Minister, Deputy Martin, to protect the taxpayer.  Instead, on the basis that money was no object, he approved an ignominious gain for short-term electoral advantage.I recall evidence on the decision on medical cards for those aged over 70 years given before the Committee of Public Accounts by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.  The Department, which was not consulted until 36 hours before the decision was announced, underestimated the numbers involved in the scheme and its cost and did not have an opportunity to consult general practitioners.  Whereas the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, estimated the scheme would cost approximately €19 million, it cost €59 million and the cost has since escalated.  This was typical of the kind of decision making in the Governments led by former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  If votes could be garnered, money was not a problem.We are told protracted discussions took place at Cabinet level before the Government decided to impose a 1% levy on the working poor, worsen the pupil-teacher ratio and snatch the medical card from the pensioners.  The two Green Party Ministers, who were participants throughout the process, did not shout "Stop".  If Fianna Fáil Ministers have long grown out of touch, what is the excuse for the Green Party Ministers?  Cycling to Cabinet meetings for the cameras does not butter parsnips.  We can picture the domestic scene on the eve of Cabinet meetings as the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputies Gormley and Ryan, respectively, dismiss their drivers and ask their spouses to leave out their bicycle helmets in the morning as the cameras might be present when they go to the Cabinet meeting.  While the novelty may not have worn off for the Green Party Ministers, it has well and truly worn off for the people who are the victims of this budget.  There is more to Cabinet decision making than cycling to Government Buildings for photo opportunities.Last night, I listened to the contribution of Deputy Gogarty who, while in opposition, constantly taunted other Opposition parties about the superiority of his education policies.  We should look at the state of his education policies in the context of the 20 page letter the Deputy sent to the Minister for Education and Science in Beijing and which he read out in the House last night.  The Deputy's party is in government.  While we do not know what Batt of Beijing thinks of the 20 page missive, did Deputy Gogarty indicate he would walk if the agenda he has set out for the Minister is not met?Deputy Gogarty also stated on a radio programme that he would raise cuts in education at the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  He might as well raise the issue in a book club.  He should ask the two Ministers from his party to deal with the issue.  Deputy Gogarty prevented the Green Party conference from discussing the highlights of the party's time in government, an understandable decision given the absence of any such highlights.  The only highlights I have seen since the Green Party entered government are those in Deputy Gogarty's hair and they seem to have disappeared since the crisis started.This is a budget which hurts the old, children and the working poor.  It has attempted to grapple with the yawning hole in the public finances by taxing everything that moves, imposing savings on medical cards for the old and cutting teachers for the young.  If one does not have a medical card, one will pay €100 to present at accident and emergency.  If one is a small saver, one will pay more DIRT and if one is on social welfare, one will receive €2 extra in the fuel allowance.  Meanwhile, there is no sign of any programme to return the economy to growth.Senior citizens have taken to the streets in their thousands, while students are protesting in a manner not seen for a generation, teachers and parents are on their way to Kildare Street and farmers are revving up in Claremorris.  There is a danger that bad government will make the country ungovernable.  The people will respond to leadership at a time of economic crisis but decision making which is unfair, ad hoc and not sure-footed will make the crisis worse.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	376	In speaking on budget 2009 I ask Government Members, individually or collectively, what are their lasting impressions of the election of 2007 or any house calls and canvassing they have carried out since the election.  I wonder what impressions they had of the rented accommodation sector.  For me, the large and obvious gap between the rich and very poor in society is a most sobering thought.According to information given to the House last week by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, rent and mortgage subsidies are paid to approximately 72,000 people.  While the majority of this group receive rent subsidy, I understand an increasing number of people are applying for mortgage interest supplement, largely due to the substantial increase in unemployment in recent months.While canvassing and making house calls, it is easy to pinpoint dwellings in the rented accommodation sector.  They often have broken gates or damaged gate piers and in many cases wall capping has fallen down or been removed, gardens are not tended and doors and windows are unpainted and in poor condition.  Despite the best efforts of the tenant, interiors are usually damp and have poor ventilation and plumbing and other problems in need of repair.  In most instances, oil or gas fired central heating is the only means of heat and in practically all cases the heating system is unusable due to the cost of fuel.  This week another application was made to increase gas prices.  Tenants will point out that landlords are not easily accessible because they tend to use agents who seldom want to hear complaints by occupiers.Thus, the lot of the private rented tenant is not a happy one.  Given the declining number of local authority houses and large waiting lists for such houses, the position will remain unchanged for some time.  From my knowledge of local authority housing, most residents are old age pensioners, single parents and young couples seeking to get on to the first rung of the home ownership ladder.  All of them receive social welfare payments.Under the heading "Considerations to bear in mind" in Annex B of the Minister for Finance's budget booklet, it is stated: "The Social Welfare measures in Budget 2009 will accrue mostly to those at the lower end of the income distribution who, without such measures, would experience a significant deterioration of their income in relative terms."  This assessment does not correspond with the fact that while the Minister gave the groups to which I referred €7, he clawed back €5 of this sum by increasing the rent supplement contribution.  How can the Government stand over this measure which will have tragic consequences for those seeking to cope with increases in the cost of living?It is difficult to understand the Green Party's approach given its previous vocal support for tenants in the private rental sector.  Yesterday, I listened to Deputy Cuffe offer his party's full support to senior citizens.  Where does the Green Party stand on the rent subsidy?  Will it support the provision increasing the subsidy by only €2 from 1 January 2009?   Will the party bring that to the attention of the Minister for Finance?  How in God's name could it be so cold, callous and uncaring of a sector that obviously cannot stand up for itself, due to fear of recrimination by the landlord?  It is unforgivable of the Green Party because there are guidelines appropriate to this case.  I was glad to receive them recently from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, when I had an issue with a local authority that had increased rent payments for those in receipt of social welfare payments over and above that specified in the Department's guidelines.  The guidelines are included in circular letter HRT3/2002 "Rents of Local Authority Dwellings", section 4 and it is fair to assume that a common line can be taken to the effect that if a Department issues such a circular, a sister Department, especially the Department of Social and Family Affairs will adhere to such a directive, given that it is specific to persons in receipt of social welfare payments.  The guidelines state:It is important that authorities should ensure that rent increases do not absorb an excessive amount to income of tenants on low incomes dependent on Social Welfare payments and in particular, old age pensions.  As a general guideline it is considered that no more than a 15% increase in such pension income should be absorbed by an increase in rent.In this budget the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has thrown out the window any referral to such guidelines.  In fact she has increased the rent by 71%, leaving the recipient with a weekly increase of just €2.  She gave €7 with one hand and took back €5 with the other.  How does this fit in with the guidelines I have just quoted from and how does it fit with the Minister for Finance's statement on the very first page, second paragraph, that the budget aimed to protect those who were most vulnerable?  Surely there are some within Fianna Fáil, and especially in the Green Party as well as the two Independents who support the Government, who see this proposal for those in rented accommodation is totally unacceptable, and will not support it in the social welfare Bill soon to come before the House.  The Labour Party will fight this issue tooth and nail, at every available level, both in and outside the House.  I ask the Green Party and the two Independent Deputies to take the matter on board and make it an issue before the social welfare Bill comes before the House.In looking at other aspects of the budget, I am disappointed with the decision to put the decentralisation programme for Kildare on hold.  The decision to stop, halt, review or whatever means that 560 employment opportunities through the placement of the Revenue Commissioners offices in Athy and Kildare in my constituency are stopped.  My disappointment is increased by the fact the IDA has publicly stated in recent local newspaper reports that it is having major difficulties in attracting industry to the constituency.  Unfortunately, it is not too difficult to see why, when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment informs me that only two itineraries have been arranged by the IDA to my constituency in five years.  If the Government wants to commence an upturn in employment, it will have to put in place incentives for SMEs, to increase employment and ensure that new SMEs are given seed capital to create employment in areas such as Kildare, where there has been an enormous increase in the unemployment figures.  The increase in the live register is up 70% in Newbridge, 56% in Athy and 65% in Maynooth.The budget does nothing to create optimism in this area, with a reduction in capital expenditure for indigenous industry to Enterprise Ireland of 29%.  The State agencies, in agreement with the local authorities, should and must provide incubation units on an organised basis, with seed capital being provided through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to kickstart local initiatives, to ensure employment growth in such areas.  In a constituency where there have been high levels of unemployment, obviously there will be delays in processing claims, as in the local central office in Newbridge.  Yesterday, I listened to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs agreeing with this.  I ask the Minister to address this matter and ensure extra people are enlisted to assist the overworked staff who are seeking to meet demands under such duress.I note Deputy Nolan from Carlow is in the House.  In the area of Carlow and south Kildare there has been a huge employment haemorrhage over the past couple of years.  We have seen Låpple and Irish Sugar close and Shuttleworth in Athy move on.  A whole raft of companies has gone among them some replacement industries that have moved on to other locations.  With this in mind I say to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland that they have failed badly as regards providing alternatives or new employment in that particular area.Cuts in the Department of Education and Science budget will affect a constituency where there are children from many nations.  I visited a school recently where there were 27 different nationalities, putting enormous pressure on the education system.  The Minister must revise this position to ensure class sizes are reduced, as promised before the general election of 2007, to ensure every child, whatever his or her nationality, gets an equal opportunity to receive a proper education.The medical card debacle is something no caring Government should have allowed itself to become involved in.  The Government did not do the ground work to establish such changes were needed beforehand.  The four-word adage, "Think before you ink" was never more relevant than in this instance.  Recent press statements from Mr. Maurice Ahern, brother of the former Taoiseach, are relevant in this regard.  It is obvious that over a long period the Department of Finance wanted the Government to come to grips with the universality of the health system.  In fairness to the previous Taoiseach, he repelled such approaches every time.I have never had so many calls from concerned senior citizens and family members seeking information, advice and general assurances with regard to the totally unacceptable withdrawal of medical cards.  Even people not directly affected, but who wanted to lend support to a neighbour or a friend, contacted me.  The universality of the health service, education and the social welfare system is a corner stone of Labour Party policy, and we will not relent in fighting for their protection.  Among the letters I got over the past few days was one from a person in north Kildare.  He said not enough had been said about the mental impact on those over 70 who were now being forced to worry about, and fill in even more forms.  This, in itself, would prevent many older folk, who qualified from applying for what had been an automatic entitlement, he said:Many will be confused and fearful about the change.  They are being hassled unnecessarily and that, in itself, is a crime by the State they have served so well, for so long.  They have each earned many times over the right to be well looked after, with a minimum of worry in their twilight years.  The medical card has acted as a great comfort of those older citizens.  The supreme irony is that the net gain to the State, after the administration cost is deducted, will be marginal, at best.It was a further stealth tax being added to the many others that old age pensioners on fixed incomes have to face, he added, before going on to quote the great 19th century leader Daniel O'Connell, who said, "Nothing is politically right that is morally wrong, and this is morally wrong".  That sums it all up as regards the medical card system.As regards the education aspect, I have a letter from a national school in relation to its third and fourth classes.  It is easy to read and very specific in saying:We are not happy at the decisions made by the Minster for Finance in last week's budget.  We are not happy, because it will be harder to learn, with more children in the classrooms.  This will affect lots of children's education.  This will affect our play.  If there are too many children, it will become a danger during playtime in the yard.  It will be difficult for teachers to look after every child.  It will be difficult for other teachers if other classes must be split up to join them because it was decided we cannot have substitute teachers.The money for children who might need special resources to help them learn has also been taken away.  This is not fair,  These resources are to help us to learn.   It has been decided to take away some of the money for schools to buy equipment also.  This is really not fair.  It is really unfair that you have decided to take away teachers that help non-national children who need help to learn English for school.  You have taken away jobs from teachers that have done a lot of work to learn to teach.  Why do you need to take away some of the money that all the schools need.  We are very concerned about this.  We would like a reply about this situation.Those two letters are very relevant in the current climate.  The senior citizen is worried beyond belief.  As that man rightly said, nothing is politically right that is morally wrong.  The same is said by a class of three and four year olds.The Labour Party will continue to fight tooth and nail to ensure those least well-off in society, such as those on rent subsidy, senior citizens and those in schools, are not left behind and forgotten by the Government.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I wish to share time with Deputy Fahey.I am pleased to speak in this budget debate.  It is an opportunity for us all to have our say on what is going on in our economy and our country.  Recent days have been overshadowed by the issue of medical cards for the over 70s.  The matter has been resolved and some clarity has come into the debate.  I was concerned from the outset that the news was that all over 70s would lose their medical cards, which clearly was not the case.  I am glad the Ministers and the Taoiseach have amended that and brought forward a scheme that is more acceptable to the over 70s.When speaking to over 70s in my clinics, on the telephone and in e-mails, the majority of them were of the view that all those over 70 years would lose their medical cards.  There was much confusion which, to a large extent, was fuelled by vested interests who wanted to ensure there was uproar among a certain section of the community in regard to a budget proposal, and they succeeded in that.  That debate has taken place and we now have clarity.  I am glad 95% of over 70s will receive medical cards.  Those who do not receive them will, by and large, be more than capable of paying for general practitioner visits.We should now focus our attention on the scale of the economic challenge facing us and which is only becoming clear.  I encourage the Government to outline at every possible opportunity the serious financial and economic situation in which this country finds itself.  We are not unique in this regard.  There is a serious global downturn of which we are part.  We are fortunate in so far as we are part of the European monetary union and, to a large extent, some of the impact of that downturn is being felt by fellow members of the EMU.  We have been cushioned somewhat by that.If the economic downturn stops next year or, indeed, the year after, we will be very fortunate.  Some commentators have said this economic downturn could go on for four years.  It will result in serious difficulties for every sector of Irish society.For the past two years, we have seen the impact that has had on our construction industry with the serious slowdown in that area.  Apart from all those directly involved, there has been a knock-on effect.  We have seen job losses in the legal area and among the professions such as architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and estate agents.  My local newspapers have seen a huge shortfall in advertising revenue.  We have been told this will continue until the number of housing units and apartments currently surplus to requirement — we have been told there are roughly 42,000 — are washed through the system.  We will then see the construction industry start again.  That is causing problems in the employment sector.  Many brickies, electricians and painters are looking for jobs.  For the past 15 years, it was difficult to get some of those tradesmen to do work.  Now there is pressure on them and prices are being cut.We have seen non-nationals, in particular from Poland and some of the new accession states to the European Union, return home.  In a way, that is good because it lessens the impact of this slowdown on the Irish workforce.However, in dealing with that, there is one aspect on which I urge caution and which has been brought to my attention over the past few weeks.  People from other EU member states who come here to work are entitled to child benefit.  However, I understand there are instances where they have not notified the authorities of the fact that they have returned to their home country and they are still drawing social welfare benefits from this State.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs and her officials will have to be mindful of this abuse of the system and put in place some scheme whereby they are notified by the home country of the return of individuals.  When people return home, the country in which they have previously worked should be notified of that fact.  Any social welfare payments should cease and revert to the host country.  I was recently made aware of a case where individuals claiming what was disability benefit have returned to their home country but continue to send certification to the Department to claim this benefit.  We must look at these issues.I would like to see some changes in the planning process.  I can only speak for my constituency but I know of a number of individuals who seem to make a career out of objecting to planning applications and are available to negotiate a solution to the problem with the applicant.  That is grossly unfair and uncalled for.  Now that we are in a slowdown, perhaps it is an issue which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government might consider.I refer to redundancies and job losses.  Perhaps it is time for the question of the public sector versus the private sector to be examined.  The private sector is the production sector which generates the revenue for the Government to function and which is being most severely hit.  The Government is putting in place a redundancy programme for sections of the HSE.  Perhaps this redundancy programme should be extended to other areas of the public sector where over-manning is evident.  It would be easy enough for Ministers and their officials to identify over-manning.Most of the functions of the health service have been given to the HSE but there are still more than 500 employees in the Department of Health and Children in Hawkins House.  I am not picking on the Department of Health and Children; I am sure there are other examples of that in the public service which could be examined.Previously, I spoke about and commended the Government on acting so swiftly, effectively and efficiently when the banking sector was under serious threat.  The Government action then has been recognised and acclaimed internationally.  At a time when the banks are being hammered by many commentators, it is important to acknowledge the role a strong banking and financial sector has in a strong economy.  If we lose the support of our financial sector, we will not attract inward investment.  We have been singularly successful in attracting that investment over the past 20 or 30 years and must continue to do so.  In order to do that, we need a strong, robust and healthy financial sector.  I urge the Government to keep this in mind.Now there is a slowdown in the economy, it is time to look again at the service sector for job creation.  Tourism has been the poor relation, with regard to commitments from Government, over the past number of years because of the strength of other sectors of our economy, but it is an area that should be given more support.  This need not be financial support.  We must remember that sectors such as tourism could generate wealth and these should be given more consideration while we go through this difficult period.We must maintain our competitive position in the global marketplace.  It will be necessary to become more competitive to attract jobs from overseas.  This is particularly apparent when we hear the statements of the campaigning candidates in the US presidential election.  They are clearly under pressure from domestic voters in terms of jobs America is haemorrhaging overseas. This is an area the candidates have highlighted and we must be mindful of it because of the significant number of individuals employed by overseas companies here.We must retain our low personal taxation rates.  I am pleased the Minister did not take the easy option and increase PAYE tax rates in the recent budget.  If we do not have a competitive personal tax rate, we will lose jobs overseas.  Our corporation tax rate has been part of the reason companies have located here.  While we saw a small increase of 0.5% in VAT rates, we can live with that.We have a well educated young workforce, but we need to continue to invest in education.  Everybody on this side of the House will come under pressure from schools which have seen their budgets cut, which will manifest itself in the loss of teaching jobs.  However, we must keep our eye on that area to ensure we do not lose what has been one of our greatest advantages for the promotion of jobs.  I think in particular of our third level institutes and our good university structure.  These institutes have been told by the Minister for Finance that savings must be identified in the sector and they must get their houses in order.We have a very good third level institute of technology structure also.  I understand there are proposals with the Department and the Minister with regard to regularising, bringing together and making savings in that sector.  One of the suggestions mooted is amalgamation.  I suggest the directors of those institutes should get together and come up with positive and meaningful proposals that would not cost the State anything more than the current budgets.  If they did this, we might see changes made that would increase their standing and the quality of the programmes and courses they offer.As a result of what we have seen over the past week, it is time for us to change our focus.  We must focus on the challenges that face us as a country, a nation and a people and the challenges that face our particular economy.  As we face even more difficult times next year, we must position ourselves to deal with those challenges.

There is no doubt that the Government confronts a challenge greater than any we have seen on many previous occasions.  However, I am convinced the Government, under the Taoiseach Deputy Cowen, is capable of meeting the challenges.  The Fianna Fáil Party, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, together with the Independent Deputies, will recognise and overcome the difficulties we face.It is vital that the solidarity and courage required of people who support the Government should be seen throughout the country in the coming days and weeks.  We will face significant challenges with the education cuts, agriculture cuts and others.  It is vital, therefore, that we stand up and defend the Government for doing the right thing.I am amazed by the response of the Fine Gael Party to the budget.  A defining moment in my 26 years in the Dáil was the 1987 budget when Ray McSharry had to take difficult decisions, just as we do today.  At the time, Alan Dukes had the courage to put the country and the best interest of the economy before the political parish pump.  It is rather sad to witness what we have seen from Fine Gael in the House over the past few days.  The Government has had to make difficult decisions.  It had to make the decision to raise tax by €2 billion in net terms so that it would end up with a general Government deficit that is still high, at 6.5% of GDP.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The Fine Gael finance spokesman said this week that if Fine Gael were in power it would not raise taxes, but would instead bring in a budget with a 5.5% deficit.  This can only mean Fine Gael favours further expenditure cuts, totalling more than €4 billion, because to reduce the deficit from 6.5% to 5.5% would cost more than €2 million.  I challenge Deputy Richard Bruton to confirm that is the position and to tell us how he would make those cuts.  I challenge him to tell the farmers at the weekend meetings the cuts Fine Gael would make — I am sure Fine Gael will say the cuts are terrible and it would not make them.  I ask Fine Gael to tell the teachers and parents who will challenge us over the next number of weeks what cuts it would make in education if not the ones proposed by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.The Fine Gael performance with regard to the budget has been cowardly and political.  This is a sad day.  I am convinced that when we have the next general election, the electorate will see Fine Gael for the Opposition it has been, full of opportunism.  Take health, for example.  Deputy Richard Bruton wants to cut €700 million more in health than the cuts made by the Minister, Deputy Harney, or than provided for in the budget.Fine Gael does not have a proper approach to a budgetary framework or to the planning or allocation of money.  Week in and out Fine Gael Deputies call for more spending.  On the Adjournment last night, we had Deputy Olwyn Enright calling for more speech therapists.  Fine Gael Deputies continue to call for more services here, there and everywhere.  However, when there are some difficult decisions to be taken——

He said:Should Tony O'Reilly have a medical card?  We have limited resources and they should be prioritised for those greatest in need.  I don't think it should be a case of who deserves it, but who needs it.That is the statement of the Fine Gael spokesman on health only 12 months ago.

What about the 65 year old man slightly over the present medical card limit who is ill in hospital and cannot get a medical card?  Fine Gael is suggesting we should keep the rules for him but we should give the medical card to the man who now will have, perhaps, €150,000 in income.I heard Deputy Rabbitte talking about those very wealthy people.  He said they did their patriotic duties by the State.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have great admiration for your party colleague in my constituency, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.

I make one prediction.  In the general election in three or four years' time, or whenever it comes, if Fine Gael and Labour really believe that the electorate is sufficiently gullible to the kind of politics they will get from those two parties in an alternative Government, they have another thing coming to them.  The reality is they will not fool the electorate at this stage.

That is hypocrisy.  The electorate is more sensible than to believe that kind of stuff.  If the Opposition had the courage to do what the former Deputy Alan Dukes did, it would get considerably more respect from the electorate.I wish to speak about some of the positive measures in the budget.  The Government's definitive statement that the 12.5% corporation tax will not be increased is very significant.  I hope that in the way the Minister put the matter in the budget he will be happy to consider reducing it when the time is right.  The 12.5% corporation tax is the single most vital aspect of the Irish success story.  It matters to the multinationals already here and those considering locating here.  There are other factors, including of course the workforce and our infrastructure.  However, the taxation matter is critical and I welcome its insertion in the Budget Statement.  We cannot ignore the fact that we are now competing with countries with lower rates of corporation tax.I also welcome the announcement on the research and development credit.  The Tánaiste is to be complimented on the way in which she put forward this measure for consideration by the Minister for Finance.  With all the other controversies around the world, people might not have noticed that the row in Washington about the $700 billion also cast doubt on the US provision for research and development tax credits.  According to Ralph Hellmann of the US Information Technology Industry Council who was quoted recently in the wall Street Journal, this was disastrous for the US.  What could be disastrous for that country could be good news for us.  That announcement in the budget is significant good news for us.  The Government decision has positioned us for this US opportunity and put us at the forefront of research and development regimes globally.  This is where we need to be and will leave us well positioned when the economy starts to recover.I also welcome the Minister's announcement on intellectual property.  It is vital that Ireland and the EU have a strong legal framework on intellectual property.  China and the other countries that had problems in this area have straightened up their acts.  We can no longer rely on people being afraid to patent in these jurisdictions.  Ireland needs to put itself at the forefront of intellectual property legal regimes and introduce incentives.  Ireland should consider introducing an artists' exemption-type scheme for scientists and others who base themselves here, register patents here, carry out research and development here and bring the associated jobs and revenue to this country.  We could have special zones for such inventors and developers of intellectual property.  I look forward to the Commission on Taxation making favourable recommendations to the Minister for Finance in this regard and I urge it to do so quickly.  These three areas are of great significance in the context of ensuring that Ireland continues to attract international foreign investment and create new jobs.I also wish to refer to the 6.5% deficit.  This issue has been lost in the frenzy that has happened in the past week.  We cannot underestimate the seriousness of the fiscal position in which we find ourselves.  A 6.5% deficit in 2009 assumes relatively small contractions in GDP in 2008 and 2009.  Exports are assumed to grow next year by 2.5% in real terms.  However, recent examination of the global economy makes that export projection appear somewhat optimistic.  If the global economy suffers a deep recession, which appears increasingly likely, Ireland's fiscal deficit will be much higher than 6.5% of GDP.  We could be facing a budget deficit of more than 10% of GDP in 2009, which would involve the necessity for large increases in tax revenues to reduce that deficit gradually over a four to five-year period.  That is the essential element of the budget.  The budget's proposals need to be implemented and not the kind of winner-takes-all approach that we have seen from the Opposition during the budget debate.The Opposition's one shining white light, Deputy Bruton, did not contribute to the farcical debate in the House over the past two nights.  Every party needs to understand the main priority for the country is that we face up to the difficult fiscal position.  If we do so, we will progress out of a recession much quicker than any other country.  I challenge Deputy Burton to outline how we will not increase taxes while reducing expenditure by €400 million.

Like Deputy Fahey, I have been a Member long enough to know what it is to be both politically responsible and politically irresponsible.  I was a backbencher during the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government in the 1980s and I recall the bear pit politics and circus in this House, the centre of democracy in this country, engaged in by Deputy Fahey and his colleagues, a number of whom are Ministers today.  The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, may not recall these times but I recall the shenanigans in the House every day during that period.  I will not listen to lectures from Deputy Fahey or any other Government backbencher about being politically responsible.When the country's interest is on the line, Fine Gael always steps up to the plate and I only have to go back two or three weeks when the financial future of the country was about to disintegrate and not to the 1980s or 1980s for the latest example.  Fine Gael, led by Deputies Kenny and Bruton, stood up and backed the Government to the hilt.  I was a Member when the Tallaght strategy was adopted.  Fine Gael supported the Government and the strategy of which Alan Dukes was the architect but there are vital differences between today and 1987.

Second, a minority Government was in power following the 1987 election and it could not implement a policy without the co-operation of the Opposition.  The Government parties have a majority of ten nowadays, which was reduced to seven last night.  They do not need a Tallaght strategy but a vigilant Opposition that will oppose the brutal cutbacks announced in last week's budget is needed.I recall being present in the House when the interest of the island, North and South, was in question and the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed by Garret FitzGerald on behalf of the Fine Gael-Labour Government.  When the national interest was in question, Fianna Fáil sent some of the most senior members of the party to the US where they were given short shrift and they were sent home with their tails between their legs by honourable American politicians.

Deputy Reilly, my colleague, has been accused of this, that and the other.  However, Deputy Martin introduced the free medical card for the over 70s as a political stunt without carrying out negotiations with the doctors, the Department of the Health and Children or the health boards and he underestimated its cost.  He has been exonerated by Government backbenchers but, hopefully, he will not be by the people.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he has washed his hands of everything that happened over the past week while his colleagues carried the burden and he hopes to return on his white steed in a few years when, hopefully, Fianna Fáil will be in opposition.

A total of 54 centres were designated and thousands of civil servants were to be transferred throughout the State.  The programme was due to be completed in 2006.  Three centres were selected in County Donegal with 250 civil servants to be decentralised to Donegal town and a few hundred to Buncrana while Foras na Gaeilge was due to move to my parish of Gweedore.  Not a solitary civil servant has been transferred to Donegal.This is a crisis budget, which was brought on by the actions of the Government, bankers and developers.  There is an international financial crisis but we are experiencing a home-grown economic crisis.  No matter what happens in America or England, we have our own difficulties.  A total of 70,000 additional people are unemployed since the day the Government took up office in 2007.  That is happening in Ireland, not America, because the Government financed a construction bubble.  Every worthwhile economist in the country knew this.  For the past three or four years, Deputy Bruton warned the bubble would burst and when it did, there would be economic and financial chaos.  That is why a crisis budget was announced last week and it has unravelled over the past few days before our eyes.

In 2002 she stated no child under nine years of age in the State would be in a class of more than 20 pupils.  Lo and behold, at least 150,000 pupils under the age of nine years are in classes of not more than 30 pupils, rather than 20.  This is the Government's record in education.

In one hour, they identified 32 brutal cuts in education.  Some jump out at me.  When I see a curtailment in the school building programme, I remember the vocational school in Stranorlar, Finn Valley College, where work has been on the cards since 1979.  I think of Gortahork, which has been seeking a new school for years, my former school of Scoil Chonaill, Bunbeg, Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair and countless other schools throughout my constituency.  How many more years must they wait because of the curtailment?Two cuts relating to the Irish language jump out at me.  According to the Government, it will be the saviour of the Irish language.  The summer colleges, which most of us who did not live in the Gaeltacht attended at one time or another, were financed from three sources.  Parents and the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Education and Science made contributions.  The latter Department's contribution was meant to pay for the teachers of the 30,000 to 40,000 young people attending the colleges every year.  What has the Department done with the capitation fee of €50 per pupil this year?  It has not been reduced.  Rather, it has been abolished.  This will be a body blow to the young boys and girls studying for their junior certificates and leaving certificates——

It will also be a blow to tourism in the Gaeltacht.  Most tourists visiting Gaeltacht areas in Donegal, Galway and elsewhere are the parents, guardians, uncles, aunts, grandfathers, grandmothers and other relatives of the pupils.  The abolition is a treble-edged sword.The second cutback was also vicious.  For a number of years, we have brought teachers into our area because we had none of our own.  They are young men and women who did not get into this country's training colleges.  A former Aire oideachas is listening to me.  Those people were trained in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK.  They came to Ireland and, before being recognised as fully fledged teachers, were obliged to do Irish oral and written examinations.  The Department was generous, probably in the time of the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and facilitated those people in spending two or three weeks in Gaeltacht areas.  The Department gave them grants because they might not have had full-time jobs.  This grant for unqualified teachers attending Irish courses in the Gaeltacht has not been reduced.  Rather, it has been abolished.  People are suffering.Much has been stated on medical cards, but I will not comment because my good colleague beside me will have something to say.  However, we are discussing health.  I have been a Member for long enough to know that we all remember what health cuts do to the old, the sick and the poor.  The mantra on the other side of the House is that the Department and the Health Service Executive have increased the health budget from £3 billion in 1997 to €16 billion in 2008.  Considering the country's hospitals, clinics and surgeries, it is difficult to determine where progress has been made.  Money has been poured in, but there are no visible results.Last week, it was announced that Letterkenny General Hospital would close two orthopaedic wards from 25 October until further notice.  What does this mean to those people, be they elderly or otherwise, who need hip or knee replacements and so on?  This is the type of budget before us.  There could be more and more of the same but, if the Government is responsible, we will support it.Níor thagair mé don Ghaeltacht in aon chor.  Tá gearraithe siar móra sa cháinaisnéis seo ar an nGaeltacht.  Baineann na gearraithe ní hamháin leis an Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, ach le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta freisin.  An bhfuil na heagraíochtaí sin fós in ann fostaíochta, obair agus saothar a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta?

#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I have seen it all now.  Has Fianna Fáil learned nothing from the history of the State?  Did the Taoiseach not state that he wanted to set Seán Lemass as his role model and follow his dynamic leadership in building a new Ireland and in making brave decisions for the good of all Irish people?  These were his words only a few months ago when he assumed the office of Taoiseach.  I now know that he wanted to follow the proven failures of de Valera, his economic or other policies that have proved to be failures over the course of time.  Instead of dancing at the crossroads, we now have singing at the crossroads.  Was it a coincidence that budget day was the late Eamon de Valera's birthday?  The Government has gone back in time to make the same mistakes.  Will Fianna Fáil never learn?Let me remind the Taoiseach of who is responsible for handing his colleague the misfortune of becoming the Minister for Finance.  One of de Valera's adversaries, Winston Churchill, once stated: "We contend that for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle".In 1997, Fianna Fáil was left a strong, sound economy.  When we handed over the reins of government, the volume of exports was growing at 17%, but it has collapsed to just 6%.  Under our Government, productivity was growing at 8% per annum, but it has collapsed to just 2%.  Then, our market share increased by 25% in four years, but this Government has cut it by 20% in four years.  To use one of Fianna Fáil's phrases, one could say that the economy was slowly roasting on the barbecue.  Fianna Fáil took it, shoved it into the microwave and turned it up to turbo power.  When the party saw the steam leaking out from the top, bottom and all sides, it watched in amazement and did nothing, but assured us at the same time that we would have a soft centre.  Now Fianna Fáil wonders why it must clean up the explosion of debris on all sides of its cooking experiment.  It is blaming the whole world, but not its little version of coward economics.

#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	415	When I look at our two financial wizards, the two Brians, I am reminded of those famous black and white films in de Valera's time, when I was still going to school, of two fellows in black suits, one of whom said to the other: "This is another fine mess you have got me into."In the current Taoiseach's budget speech last year, he stated the national development plan was his top priority.  Postponing or delaying it would be "a major policy error", which would "damage activity next year and impair our quality of life in future".   This is another fine mess.  The Taoiseach also stated that the provision of medical cards for vulnerable families is a priority for the Government, pointing to the commitment in the programme for Government to double the income eligibility limit for parents of children less than six years of age and to treble it for parents of children less than 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.  That puts a whole new meaning on the phrase "A lot done, more to do".To remove the automatic entitlement to a medical card for those over 70 years of age is another example of the Government's maladministration.  It bribed the electorate with this measure and wasted taxpayers' money in implementing it.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, underestimated by half the numbers availing of this benefit.  He had not consulted doctors before the scheme was announced and ended up paying them five times what they were paid for treating patients who obtained their medical cards after a means test.It is not the fault of the over 70s that the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, did not read another of his briefing papers, with the result that the taxpayer had to shoulder the exorbitant cost of providing these "golden" medical cards.  To remove this security from the elderly and possibly infirm in tough times shows a mean streak in the Government.  It is exacerbated by the reduction to the standard rate for tax rebates on medical expenses.  Does this apply to those who have worked to be in a position to pay their own nursing home costs, those who must pay for nursing home recuperation after surgery, those who do not want to enter the fair deal arrangement or those who employ a carer for an elderly relative?  What a wonderful effort to protect the weak and vulnerable.The Minister for Finance is proposing to raise an extra €2 billion from the hard-pressed taxpayer.  A large portion of that figure is accounted for by glaring mistakes on the part of various Ministers, such as PPARS, illegal nursing home charges, electronic voting, the additional costs associated with medical cards for the over 70s, the "Bertie bowl", Thornton Hall, Punchestown, the Kenmare marina project, the M50 toll bridge and so on.  Instead of suffering only a 10% reduction in their salaries, the Ministers concerned should have been sacked.  Members may recall a television programme called "The Six Million Dollar Man".   Now we have the Six Billion Euro Wasters.Last week, I tabled a parliamentary question on the provision of roadside facilities for tourists travelling around Ireland in motor caravans.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism refused to answer the question, stating he had no official responsibility.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did likewise.  The Minister for Transport responded that it was a matter for the National Roads Authority.  It is not only the construction industry and the banking sector that are in trouble; the tourism industry has had its worst year for a long time.  If three Ministers choose to absolve their responsibilities rather than roll up their sleeves and get stuck in when times are tough, they can only be described as wasters.This budget did nothing to stimulate economic growth and employment.  It did nothing to promote tourism or agriculture.  It did nothing for the people of west Cork.  Farmers are faced with the abolition of the farm installation grant and the retirement scheme, with several other cuts likely to be revealed in the coming months.

He may need a full-face helmet by the time of the next budget not only to hide his face but to protect his neck.The fishing industry is faced with serious difficulties.  I am reminded of the saying, "A rising tide raises all boats".  The fishing boats are rising and falling with every tide but they are tethered to the quay side, being unable to fish for half of the year.  The budget did nothing for fishermen, who are left with less money than they had before.  Where will the funding come from to assist them in repaying their huge borrowings for their super-trawlers?The Government took the soft option of introducing 30 stealth taxes and doubling the borrowing requirement in nine months.  I take this opportunity to remind them of the old saying: "Borrowing, like scratching, is only good for a while".  The Government has been found out and its days are numbered.I am particularly concerned by the suspension of care of the elderly schemes due to a lack of finance.  Will elderly citizens be left to die in their homes this winter?  Cork County Council alone is processing 5,000 applications for the scheme, which must now be set aside pending funding allocation.  The scheme that was introduced six months ago amid much fanfare offered assurances to every senior citizen that grants would be available to assist them in upgrading their homes.  Now, however, they are being left to shiver in the cold.  The Government's conduct in this matter is disgraceful.There are many stings in the tail of this budget which will not be fully unravelled until the various Ministers have introduced all measures in the House.  The increase in the pupil-teacher ratio will lead to the loss of 400 teaching jobs, 200 at primary level and 200 at secondary level.  At my clinic in Skibbereen last Saturday, five constituents told me about the difficulties they have encountered in securing speech therapy for their children.  Thirty minutes per week is inadequate.  I spoke to the parents of a young person who had a serious palate operation and who was told by the surgeon that she needed additional therapeutic care in the school she is attending.  She was allocated 30 minutes of speech therapy per fortnight.  There is no evidence here of the caring Government about which we hear so much.The Government has lost the confidence of the public throughout the State.  One had only to stand on the plinth outside Leinster House yesterday to see the anger of the 15,000 elderly people who came to protest against the serious disadvantages they face as a result of the introduction of means testing of over 70s for the medical card.  The Government cannot stand over its policy, a policy which was responsible for me losing my seat in 2002.  The introduction of a universal entitlement to a medical card for over 70s was announced six months before that election.  It achieved its objective of ensuring a majority for Fianna Fáil, but it kept me out of Dáil Éireann for another five years.

Deputy O'Rourke is of my vintage and in my league.The Government's actions are despicable.  Elderly people were not told that the provision of medical cards for all over 70s was merely a temporary measure.  Will there now be means testing in respect of free travel and electricity and telephone allowances?  Is this the thin edge of the wedge?I am trying to instil some knowledge in the people opposite.  However, I fear my words are in vain as they are not taking any notice of what I am saying.  The people will take notice during the European and county council elections.  If the Government tries to introduce another referendum on the Lisbon treaty it will feel the wrath of the people.I have been a Member of this House for the past 23 years.  Never in that time have I witnessed that which I witnessed last night.  The taxi driver who took me to my accommodation last night, on finding out I was a member of the Fine Gael Party, refused to take from me any payment for the journey as a gesture of goodwill to the Fine Gael Party for its stance in regard to the scandalous act of the withdrawal from persons aged over 70 years of the universal right to a medical card.

The staff at these schools are teaching their pupils in totally unsuitable accommodation.  Files on these projects have been sitting on desks, collecting mould, in the Department of Education and Science for the past ten years.  Not one penny has been allocated to any of these projects, which is a disgrace.It is likely a further budget will be introduced in six months time given the current one was introduced only nine months after the Government took office.  The Government must heed the people.  If it does not, it is bound for failure.

Before I do, however, I wish to speak briefly about the medical card issue on which, it appears to me, there was a great deal of play acting.  I regret that confusion arose between last week and early this week until the matter was cleared up.  However, two characteristics of the main Opposition parties were absent in terms of the manner in which they dealt with this debate.I will deal first with the Labour Party, members of which may want to respond to what I have to say.  As I understand it, the Labour Party represents socialism, the essence of which is that those who deserve something get it, and those who do not deserve it do not.  This allows one to target scarce resources at those most in need.  I understood that to be the essence of socialism.  It appears this is no longer the case because the Labour Party now wishes everybody over the age of 70 years to get a medical card, regardless of means.Deputy Pat Rabbitte stated that he doubted there were 25,000 millionaires in Ireland.  I am not a millionaire but I earn enough to ensure I do not need a medical card, a position I am glad to be in.  I hope many others are in the position of being able to afford to meet their own medical expenses.  I deserve no credit in this regard.  I told the truth and was not the butt of endless jokes among a certain political party in this House as evidenced in the columns of a popular national newspaper.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Will the Deputy fill us in on that?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Second, a quality of the Fine Gael Party that I have always admired is that of self-reliance, that one should provide for oneself where possible and should not rely on Government to do so.  It is perhaps this which prevented Deputy Richard Bruton attending the debate on the medical card issue on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.  I am a little perplexed about this.  As far as I am aware, having checked the matter on Google, Deputy Bruton did not speak on the issue on either Tuesday or Wednesday night but he did turn up for a vote on the matter at 8.50 p.m. as shown in the vote results on the Internet.  I believe the reason for this is because he is imbued with the Fine Gael characteristic of self-reliance that one should not seek or act in a fashion that results in one scattering money all over the place but should, if possible, mind oneself.It is interesting that nobody has, as yet, picked up on the fact that Deputy Bruton, the shining light of the Fine Gael Party, did not attend that debate.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Did Deputy O'Rourke check the position on Google in regard to some of her own colleagues?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	435	Deputy Ulick Burke and I soldiered together in our exile in Seanad Éireann and always got on well.  Deputy Sheehan stated the reason he was not re-elected to the House.  I, too, know why I was not re-elected.  However, I am here now and happy to be here, as I am sure is Deputy Ulick Burke.I was struck by the absence from the debate of these two salient characteristics, namely, Labour Party socialism where one targets money at those who need it and the Fine Gael characteristic of self-reliance.  Both were absent from the debate as was Deputy Bruton.  Last night, I watched "Tonight with Vincent Browne" on which Deputy Simon Coveney, the breakfast roll man, was a guest.  It was interesting to listen to Deputy Coveney try to wriggle his way past questions relating to Deputy Reilly, who was not a guest on the programme.  Deputy Reilly is not to be produced publicly for a while.Deputy Reilly is the man who less than 12 months ago said that medical cards should not be indiscriminately awarded to everybody over the age of 70 years.  How quickly he changed his mind.  Of course, he was not at that time representing the IMO but was a Member of this House, which makes it even more amazing that he was able to say that.Some 70 year olds with whom I spoke expressed to me their real fear that by some mischance Fine Gael and Labour and, whoever else they could bring with them — we know they have a few confréres, might form a Government.  They genuinely do not want to see those parties in government.

They are fearful the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, parties so strangely in alliance now as they were on previous occasions, would perchance get into government, which would not benefit the country.This was never going to be a pretty budget, nobody ever said it would be.  How could it be?  It is a budget in which very practical and austere decisions had to be taken.  While we were not aware of the decisions taken, we knew this would be an extremely difficult budget.  I believe if the current situation continues, future budgets will be even more difficult.How can anyone on the one hand say we should give everything to everyone thus making everyone happy and on the other hand say we should not upset anyone or any group?I will speak briefly on the pupil-teacher ratio.  An earlier speaker, Deputy Sheehan, stated that 200 primary teachers and 200 secondary teachers would lose their jobs.  No permanent teacher in this country will lose his or her job.  Teachers may go to another school either within the panel system or at second level on the redeployment system but a permanent teacher——

The idea that teachers will suddenly lose their permanent teaching post is incorrect.  I regret any diminution in the standard of teaching care in our schools.  The teachers we have at both primary and post-primary level are of the highest calibre.I lived to tell the tale in this regard.  The Acting Chairman and Deputy Burke may not have been here — the Deputy may have been in Garbally — but I was a Deputy in 1987, serving as Minister for Education.  I do not know if anybody else in the House now was a Deputy at the time.  There was a pupil-teacher ratio change of three proposed at primary level and two at post-primary level.  On one Saturday there were marches and I found it difficult to go anywhere, although I went to them.  On a Saturday there were 6,000 teachers outside my modest home — if I can describe it as such — in Athlone.  I live in a small bungalow on the side of the road and there were gardaí and everything brought to control the 6,000 people outside my house.The teachers came, sent in a deputation and we spoke before they left and went into town.  On the following Monday the Athlone Chamber of Commerce wrote to me to say the town greatly benefited from the numbers at my gate and asked if I could arrange for them to come again.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	444	That is a new twist; one needs a superlative.

I still have the letter because I thought it was such a sign of entrepreneurship that the businesses were willing to seize the day of delight which came to the town.  It was not a day of delight for me.  I lived through all that and came out the other end.  I did not lose my seat in the following election, despite all the furore.It was a very difficult time but no permanent teacher at primary or post-primary level lost his or her job.  There were teachers working on a temporary basis but any profession has temporary positions from time to time.  The people who fill them know their mandate to work in the position is limited by the nature of the contract they entered.  There are many positives in this budget.

It will not go up and I hope it may decrease if we overcome this recessionary period.  There are many other matters in which the productive elements of this country were helped and will continue to be helped so we will be able to avail of employment opportunities if and when they come.  We will be able to work through our difficulties and emerge the other end.It is a very difficult time and it would be very easy to throw one's hands up and say we cannot do anything, it is all too difficult and we should all throw money at everything and everybody.  We all know what the country would end up like then.

What about the major advances in pension entitlements and special needs assistants, SNAs?  Special needs assistants were not heard of ten years ago but now there are SNAs in schools and parents with a child with a particular difficulty can have the assistance of an SNA to help him or her through the school years.  The measure was a marvellous advantage in the world of education.  I did not bring it in because we had no money at all when I was Minister.There is also the capital programme, which has a significant backlog of projects to be attended to.  Every one of us as Deputies could stand up and list off primary and post-primary projects that are badly needed.  We hope that funding from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, will enable us to finish what is on hand and give the go-ahead to some new projects.

I am convinced the country is worth backing up now in order that we can come through the difficulties and emerge at the other end.I thank the Acting Chairman for listening and giving me the time.  I will give way to my colleague, Deputy Aylward, and give him the remainder of my time.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I thank my esteemed colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for sharing her time and for the compliment.  I appreciate it as I am sure I will not get many more today.The intensity of the public debate surrounding this budget has been ferocious and the public response has been extremely hostile so far.  Granted, the issue which has received the most focus is emotive and does not easily lend itself to rational discussion.  We can learn some very useful and constructive lessons from this controversy.  It is now high time to have a cool head and reflect calmly on the issues this debate has thrown up.  We must move on in a more enlightened and even-handed way.As a nation, we must face up to the acute and pervasive problems which will affect all of us in one way or another.  We must take these problems very seriously and we must all act with a strong and deliberate sense of public duty.  We must approach our circumstances with a reinforced unity of purpose.We are confronted by adversity now and the truth is we are not used to that.  It is incumbent on all of us now, politicians and citizens alike, to behave wisely and reasonably.  The national interest, both on an economic and a social level, are at stake and the quicker we all realise that, the better.  The corrective policies which we adopt now are vital if we want to restore order and stability to the public finances and to the economy in general.It is very important that the central thrust of this Government's intention should not be lost in all the emotion, the political drama and the arguments which have been played out everywhere in the past week or more.  We cannot afford to allow ourselves to be deflected from our main job of work, which entails many hard choices and tough decisions.  We must take remedial action now to ensure we manage the public finances correctly and continue to promote economic growth and prosperity when we emerge from the doldrums of the current global crisis.We cannot delude ourselves.  We must all remember and understand that we are now living in severely altered circumstances compared to those which prevailed up to very recently.  The harsh reality is that our revenues are vastly depleted compared to those we have had at our disposal and which we have enjoyed.  The bald fact is we have much less money to share and there are ever-increasing demands on the public purse.  We must make judicious decisions about where that money is spent. We have so many competing and deserving interests but the onus is on the Government to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent carefully and invested prudently.  The Government is compelled to make these strategic decisions based on the bigger national picture and take the overall long view.We must understand that the Government is motivated purely and simply by financial practicalities and fiscal constraints.  The clear intention is to economise and allocate the available resources evenly and fairly while at the same time identifying areas of spending which can be reduced.  This — no more and no less — is in the national interest.The Government is driven by the clear need to cut its cloth to suit its measure and the budget is formulated in the context of much less money to go around on everyone.  The overriding imperative is to direct these scarce resources to those who need them most, which is basic common sense.It is not the intention of the Government to victimise or penalise any section of our society.  It is not the intention to cause hardship, rather, this is a concerted and genuine attempt to tackle some of the more expensive aspects of our recurring costs.  Public expenditure must be reduced as much as possible on the current side and as much as is practical on the capital side.The Government's objective is to effect real savings in areas where they should be attained and where escalating costs cannot be justified.  The stark reality with which we must grapple is that tax revenues will diminish for the next couple of years.  While we have many bitter pills to swallow to rectify our position, if we take our medicine now we can maintain our living standards in the longer term.  We have enjoyed so much comfort in the past 12 years or so that we now find it hard to adjust our collective mentality.  We have grown accustomed to unprecedented levels of prosperity and it seems to be difficult to adapt to a more frugal approach.  However, we have no choice but to adjust our priorities immediately.The Government is being realistic.  It recognises that shrewd management of the public finances is essential at this time.  We must cut back on our expenditure and we must find savings wherever we can.  The Government is acting with honourable intent and its bona fides are genuine.

The Government is forced to operate within the current parameters for public spending and to do otherwise would be reckless and certainly would do untold damage to the long-term budgetary strategy of this country.There is an element of the medical card debate that is relevant and worth noting in the wider context of this finance debate.  I am glad the principle of means testing has been retained in this instance.  I believe it to be a fair way of assessing whether an individual can afford to pay his or her own way.  It is generally accepted that anyone who can afford to pay should pay for some of the State services they receive.  Virtually no one disagrees with that principle.  No one expects the taxpayer and the State to carry the entire cost for those who have sufficient means to pay their own way.  In an ideal world with limitless resources, of course it would be desirable to retain the concept of universality or automatic entitlement but the pressing reality now is that we simply cannot afford to extend that luxury to everyone, irrespective of their means.  I do not believe there will be any resistance to the introduction of means testing, which is a fair basis on which to assess the capacity to pay or the ability to do without State assistance in certain cases.  Moreover, it allows the State to disburse limited resources on a fair and even basis.  Ultimately, it will ensure that available moneys are delivered to those who need the support of the State to meet their daily needs or to provide essential public services.The unvarnished truth is that international forces and domestic factors have conspired to make our fiscal situation extremely difficult.  The Government must readjust its spending priorities in the light of this rapid downturn.  It must be both cautious and discerning in the allocation of taxpayers' money.  Obviously, moneys targeted at one group necessarily will mean that another group will be deprived.  The Government must reconcile the books and must use its resources as effectively as it can.  With this in mind, I do not believe that anyone would refuse to pay or would expect the taxpayer to bear his or her costs for some of the State services.  It is only fair and equitable and I firmly believe most people will regard that as a very reasonable proposition when we are living through times which demand more restraint.Everyone must have a sense of good conscience and fair play.  Unfortunately, some people in our society are disadvantaged and are in need of State support and assistance to improve their quality of life.  That is the precise reason total spending on social welfare next year will be €19.6 billion.  I welcome that such expenditure will directly benefit 1.5 million people.  Members must acknowledge they have a bounden duty to support the men and women who rely solely on the State to assist them in making ends meet and I am satisfied the Government has discharged this duty well.  At the same time, one must recognise there are those who do not need the intervention of the State to maintain their living standards and to carry certain costs.  We have no option but to exercise great caution in the distribution of public moneys and one must be sure that everyone gets their fair share.  Fairness is the operative word in this regard and is no less than a moral obligation in these straitened times.Like running any good business outfit, Members must guarantee that the State is getting good value for money, must identify any forms of waste and must ensure that such waste is eliminated.  Members must ensure that all agencies of the State are carrying out a useful role and function and if there is room for rationalisation within the apparatus of State, they simply must examine the structures carefully and must manage strategic reform of that sector.  In that context, I look forward to the publication of the Government's proposals for public sector reform in the coming days and weeks.

It is single-mindedly determined to meet those challenges within the framework of this budget.  As the Taoiseach noted, Ireland is very much open for business.  We must keep a steady hand on the wheel to ensure we maintain our international reputation as a good place to do business.  It is essential to ensure that the right environment is sustained in order that Ireland continues to be an attractive location for direct inward investment.  The Government's sustained focus is on enterprise and job creation, on increasing exports and developing new markets.  Consequently, we must ensure that we remain competitive, have the appropriate skills base and that our tax and regulatory regimes are conducive to increased investment, expansion and job creation.The budget sets out a well defined path towards economic recovery in the next few years.  Although the path may be difficult, our destination is attainable.  If we all resolve to make our own contribution, we will be well placed to seize the opportunities that a renewed economy will present.  This budget represents a sound blueprint with a balanced share of strategic investment in order that this country will be well poised to capture the benefits which will come our way in time.  We must remember that our basic economic structure is in good condition.  However, unless we implement the right measures now, we will dismantle all the positive improvements that have been made to this economy over the last decade.  We must ensure the economy is robust in order that it can withstand the ravages of the worldwide financial turmoil and is in a strong position to re-establish itself as a progressive, modern and open economy.The budget is not all about finance and the economy.  The people, who have worked hard to make this economy so vibrant and resilient, are being treated in a fair and practical way and those who are marginalised are getting the State support they deserve.  We are all in this together and are all in this for the long haul.  I am convinced we can achieve our aims if we combine to show a generous sense of public-spiritedness and a modicum of fair play for everyone.  This budget is a collective endeavour that demands the commitment and support of every man and woman in this country.

As Chairman of that committee, I note this budget makes clear the Government has learned nothing from the serial wastage of public moneys that comes before the committee every week.  While public money is a precious resource to be used for the public good, unfortunately the Government has perceived it as a means to buy votes and help the friends of Fianna Fáil, especially those from the Galway tent.  The medical cards for over 70s service was announced without having done ground work on the necessary costing and negotiations.  The Government failed to prepare and now seeks to burden many of those who are over 70 and the taxpayer with that burden, because the doctors negotiated a better deal than did the Government.  My consolation is that at least Deputy Reilly now is on the people's side.  Unfortunately for the people, they still are stuck with the same Government to negotiate for them.The same Government decided that instead of preparing a plan, a decentralisation program was to be initiated with lofty goals and with no prior negotiation.  It was turned from being a good concept into a gimmick in which both taxpayers' money and civil servants were used for political gain and not for public good.  The same people who brought us the HSE are still in charge.  They have failed to gain for the people proper improvements in the health sector.  For all the major financial increases in recent years, the health service has worsened.  While such major financial increases will not recur, thanks to the Government we still have a substandard service.  Health also has been used by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats as a political tool.At the end of 2006 the HSE knew its budget for 2007 was going to be over target but it did not look for detailed cutbacks until the summer of 2007, which was subsequent to the general election.  This issue is relevant to the budget debate because it is central to the Government's weakness in terms of dealing with its finances.  A culture within the HSE of expecting historic allocations plus inflation has allowed for limited systematic change in health services because most of the new money invested chases after old money to prop up services under pressure and, as a result, little is left for new services.  If something is inefficient in our health services, it will not improve if it simply gets more money.In regard to the significance of the summer of 2007 as the beginning of the cutbacks, a tradition has developed within the HSE to expect Government bail-outs above and beyond original allocations.  Naturally, therefore, various managers decided to try their luck.  This tradition has led to a dysfunctional budgeting system within the HSE and it exposes the Government's detachment from the reality of the health services.  Without some control the public good will not be served.  Another reason the Government chose the summer of 2007 was that it did not want to cut services until after the general election.Far from taking care of the old, the sick and the vulnerable, after the election the Government found savings in services for older people and the disabled.  This year's report by the Comptroller and Auditor General contains a key section on our health services which probably passed the Government by.  It does not want to admit its mistakes and certainly does not want to learn from them.  Its money-saving sights are still set on older people, but this time they are focused on their medical cards.It was formerly difficult to understand the Government's priorities given that it was able to give money to everyone on the back of massive property tax revenues.  However, now we know where it has hitched its wagon.  In the aftermath of the budget, the only sectoral representative who stood out like the cat that got the cream is our former colleague, Tom Parlon.  He has continued the Government's representation of the building industry by becoming the director general of the Construction Industry Federation.  Never forget that when it comes to priorities, Fianna Fáil will choose the builders over anyone else.  For far too long, Fianna Fáil bet the economy on the building industry and now we are being asked to pay for its gamble.  When its developer friends were milking it on the backs of first-time buyers, the Government was happy because it was getting its cut.  When the builders need a dig out, the Government's first priority is to find equality of pain for the lowest paid in our society through an income tax levy.  It is funny, or tragic, that equality of gain in the good times was off the agenda for Fianna Fáil's friends in the building industry.When Fianna Fáil backbenchers gave a standing ovation to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the income levy, the medical card cuts, the education cutbacks and the cutbacks in agriculture, we saw what they really thought.  They were so out of touch with the people that they cheered and clapped.  How many voters are now wondering how they could have voted these Deputies into power?  Almost 50% of the electorate voted for Government parties in the last election.  The only people with less to be happy about are Green Party voters, who did not realise they had given Green Party Ministers a mandate to blindly follow Fianna Fáil no matter where they were taken.Education is the foundation for our economic future.  By increasing class sizes the Government has ensured that each student gets less time from his or her teacher and that each teacher must expend more effort in trying to control his or her class.  It means that education is not ring-fenced to secure our future prosperity.  Deputy O'Rourke, who I respect very much, gave out the spin that no permanent teacher will lose a position.  Certainly, however, those who are substitute teaching after spending as many as seven years in university in the hope of a career in education no longer have any hope.  Last Saturday night I was told by some of these young people that they were planning to emigrate to Perth in Australia for a few years.  It is sad that the emigrant boat is leaving once again because it will affect every family represented in this House.  It is a pity that the hopes and talents of our young people will again be lost to other countries.  After 28 years in this House, I see that we are almost back to where we started.  I recall the early 1980s, when the IMF hovered threateningly and there were protests outside our doors, hunger strikers and disgruntled teachers.  We are back to square one.It was a mistake not to include in the bank guarantee a provision for a Dáil committee to scrutinise the banks and their behaviour.  The Minister for Finance has taken too much power to himself and avoided proper accountability.  He considers it sufficient to receive a report every six months.  It is well understood within financial circles that events move so fast that a report should be made to a committee of this House, be it the Committee on Finance and the Public Service or the Committee of Public Accounts, on a monthly basis at least.  The committee in question should have its experts who could report on progress made.  Even though the banks got into this mess because of their lack of accountability and transparency, the Minister is proceeding on the same basis.  It is foolish to believe circumstances will not change significantly over a six-month period.This budget does not prepare us for the future.  It targets young, lower paid and older people while giving the construction industry what it wants.  Fianna Fáil has lost sight of the people of Ireland and Fine Gael is more representative of them.   It is a sad day when, even after its display of incompetence, the Government has not yet given older people a clear picture of what lies ahead for their medical cards.  It has failed to prepare for the future and has fallen short in terms of leading the country when times are not so good.  We are now paying the price for Fianna Fáil's stewardship of the country.  Unfortunately, matters are getting worse because of the shambolic party that forms the centre of the Government.The Government is so incompetent that it cannot even do a proper U-turn on medical cards.  It looked dumb-founded at older people's so-called ingratitude to its out of touch attempt at a U-turn.  It is now wounded and its chaotic leadership style will further damage Ireland.  I am glad the Taoiseach has taken off for China because he has been a source of confusion in the medical card debacle.  Fianna Fáil Ministers and backbenchers have shown such a pathetic grasp of reality that they gave a standing ovation to this budget.  The Cabinet was so out of touch that almost a full week had passed before it realised the depth of public anger.  It has blown the goodwill it needed from the people to get through the tough times that lie ahead.  Its leadership is now in question and we may be heading for a general election sooner than we think.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  When the Taoiseach made his statement to the House, one comment in particular caught my attention.  He stated: " Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures."  Nothing has ever been displayed to such an extent as these words.  It was unprecedented to bring the budget forward from the usual date in December to October.  In doing that, we know the carelessness with which it was put together.  The Ministers were not aware of the contents and significance of the budget measures.  They were out of touch with reality.  Looking back and regretting that they brought it forward, if they had the opportunity they would have thought it out properly.  It amazed the public how each Minister could sit around a table to produce it.As each day goes by, new issues are arising and are being teased out.  There was a failure to scrutinise adequately the proposals and bring them forward to the people in an acceptable way.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, made a peculiar statement in his contribution and perhaps he can clarify it in the future.  He stated that one has to be inside the tent to get things done.  Coming from Galway, that could mean lots of things.  What comes to mind immediately is the tent in Galway.  It was a Fianna Fáil motto to have that idea out there.  Over the years that the tent was in Galway, every developer and builder was told they had to be inside that tent to get things done.  That has laid the foundation of the situation we are now in.  Deputy O'Connor may have put a different construction on that tent but that is the reality of getting inside tents.I refer to Deputy Fahey's deliberations today when he accused Fine Gael of hypocrisy in what the party has done in the past fortnight.  If ever there was a man, and a former Minister, who must look into the mirror to see the epitome of hypocrisy, surely it is Deputy Fahey.  In his absence, I remind him that when we see the relics of his time as Minister we are reminded of his schemes such as the lost at sea scheme.  There is a review of this and we await the outcome of the investigation and what it will throw up.  Many people will be interested in that issue.I refer to the spin we have had during the past hour in this House, including Deputy O'Rourke suggesting no teacher will lose a job.  In fact, 1,000 teachers at primary level and 1,200 at secondary level will lose their jobs.  The schools affected by such losses are trying to come to terms with the serious consequences of the delivery of a proper education system in those circumstances without those teachers.  I will return to this matter.The budget was a panic response to the total irresponsibility of the Government.  Each Minister, without exception, has played a part in bringing our economy to a standstill and worse.  Deputy Bruton described the budget of the Minister for Finance as a black budget with the potential to turn a recession into a depression.  That is the sad reality of the Fianna Fáil-led Government of the past ten years.  Now, they say they are demanding a patriotic response from the people.  Many have mentioned the patriotic response of all members of Government, bar the Minister when he delivered his speech, when they cheered this budget.  There was a total lack of realisation of the depth of cuts and the hurt it would bring to so many.  We need only refer to the situation outside the gates of Leinster House, with 10,000 or more elderly people driven in desperation to bring the message home to an unresponsive Government.  The Government made five efforts at a U-turn and failed.  It is out of fashion to make a U-turn in Fianna Fáil and that is saying something.It took a person of the quality of Ms Anna Manahan to come out publicly on behalf of the elderly to say it is unacceptable that the medical card will be taken from the over 70s.  That was one of the major factors that led to yesterday's situation.  Half an hour later, 15,000 third level students were outside the gates saying they would not accept the return of fees because they have the benefit of an opportunity, namely to get an education and find work, that would be denied to so many others if fees were returned.My main problem with the budget is the lack of a policy initiative that might indicate the Government has a plan or a programme for recovery.  The Government can talk about it and the needs but there is no plan that we can recognise.  We see Minister after Minister wheeled in here to announce the bits and pieces of cuts they will make.  Today, we were told there would be further details of further actions.  In an article in The Irish Times last week, the Taoiseach wrote:I appreciate the sacrifices that this Budget requires.  If we stay the course, however, I know that we will come through these difficult times and on to a path to economic recovery and renewal.That will not happen.  I suspect that what he means by "if we stay on course" is if he is able to remain in government for a while it might automatically lead to recovery, which we hope will be sooner rather than later.  However, in the absence of structured policies that simply will not happen.The people of this country are in a state of shock after the good times.  Now we are back to the days of high borrowing, rising debt and an increasing tax burden on all people.  A 1% levy across all sectors was initially included but then the Government rowed back and said a certain limited number of the lower paid would be exempt from it.  It was a crude instrument, a sledge that frightened everybody because of the consequences.In his delivery on budget day, the Taoiseach said the only way to provide quality public services and to maximise support for the less well off is to get back to strong public finances as quickly as feasible and to take the actions required to achieve this objective.  What did the Taoiseach and his Ministers do in response to that?  They made cuts and hurt the elderly, the young and the farming community.  I shall return to that last point.It is clear there has been an abject failure to reform the way we spend our taxes.  Deputy Fahey's outburst against the Opposition in the Chamber today was, in part, because of jealousy of his constituency colleague who has a flush fund, a dormant account that he can spend in any place he wishes, while Deputy Fahey, no longer a Minister, is feeling the cold breeze.With regard to education it is very important that we realise that the 32 cuts as now revealed will, if implemented, have serious consequences for the quality of education and for those who will suffer the subsequent outcome.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned special needs assistants, SNAs, earlier.  That is fine but she left out the important factor that legislation and demands from the public required us to have a response to the special needs of people.  It is regrettable the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O'Keeffe, has postponed his statutory duties with regard to the implementation of that legislation, hurting once again the most vulnerable in our society, those with special needs.  Many people are not aware that the consequences of that action is that many people with special needs will be further penalised within the education system.  It will be the same for those who cannot get access to proper support in their community and in their homes, either at an earlier stage under the Department of Health and Children or later when the responsibility lies with the Department of Education and Science.  The Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, is new to the role and was pressurised and therefore the cut was greater in this instance.We can look at the 32 cuts.  In ways they are small but are demoralising in the effects they will have on particular groups.  I shall mention a few of these.  With regard to substitution, there is nothing in the statements of the Minister for Education and Science that shows he understands the consequences and the downside of the wiping out of substitution except through medical certification.  From now, the practical situation in schools is that if a teacher is out on any given day for any reason, school duties or otherwise, there will be chaos.  Some teachers will have to look after two classes or, as I believe the alternative will be in small, rural primary schools, students will have to be sent home.  If that is the type of education the Minister and this Fianna Fáil-led Government is to bring in, it is time for them to go.The Government promised before the last general election that no child under nine years of age would be in a class of 20 or more.  Now we know that at least 100,000 children will be in classes of 30 or more in the ordinary run of events, as and from now.  I can name three schools in my local area which had an enrolment of 48 pupils on 30 September.  Two, Clontuskert and Foneagh, will not quality for the additional teacher to which they would have been entitled next September as a result of the Minister's raising the pupil-teacher ratio by one.  In that situation, if one teacher is absent for a day for some reason, how can the Minister expect a lone working principal teacher with responsibilities for administration and everything else to cater for 48 students in that school?  This is the reality that was not thought out by the Minister or the Government and the consequences will be unbelievable.In secondary and primary schools there will be no opportunity for children to be involved in extra-curricular activities such as games, drama or any other social situation, if this decision is implemented.  Will we have a Minister who denies, at primary level, an adequate number of teachers in schools, who especially denies services to those with special needs, who at second level eliminates those other facilities?Time and again over the past two months we have heard Ministers in the areas of health and education talking about obesity and the necessity to involve students in PE and in active healthy activities, with proper healthy food.  This is typical Fianna Fáil speak, out of both sides of their mouths.  They say one thing but do the other thing which undermines the first.  I know that over the next weeks concerned parents and teachers at all levels will seriously protest about a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.Another new Minister, another new broom, was swept under the table of Cabinet when he was forced to introduce the abolition of installation aid and the retirement pension.  There were cruel cuts in disadvantaged areas and other schemes.  Various spokespersons for rural people, not merely the IFA, have spoken of the commitment many people have.  Earlier we had a Government spokesman talking about the support for business and start-up business.  That is a classic example of doublespeak.  Members of Government talk in this Chamber of support for new businesses while at the same time they deny young people the opportunity to work their inheritance and have an opportunity of a living in rural Ireland.  They do so by taking away grants.  Those who have already entered into that movement are now told there are huge expenses.  Many have leased property and have involved themselves in considerable loans in anticipation——

I understand I will share time with Deputy Timmy Dooley.I look forward, at this late stage in the discussion, to making a few observations on the budget and overall financial position, specifically the Estimates which were published as part of a booklet circulated in the House during the Budget Statement.  The debate on Estimates usually takes place at a different time of the year with the result that important issues are frequently overlooked.Like the curate's egg, this year's Estimates are a mixture of good and not so good news.  In the few short minutes since I entered the Chamber I have taken a note of the aspects of the Estimates which will affect my constituency of Laois-Offaly, especially County Laois.  Most of what I have jotted down is good news for my county.Some people are pessimistic by nature and only see bad news, while others are excessively optimistic.  I take a pragmatic approach of welcoming good news and taking bad news on the chin.  I recognise the need to bring forward the Budget Statement in response to the gravity of the economic position.  I propose to dwell on some of the projects covered in the Estimates for 2009, which will have a tremendously beneficial effect throughout County Laois and beyond.  In particular, I refer to the proposed levels of current and capital investment, which will help improve quality of life and educational, social and transport infrastructure in my county.  All counties will benefit and County Laois is not special in this regard.  However, as a relatively small county, it will receive a fair share of the national cake, albeit neither much more nor certainly not less than that to which it is entitled.  Deputies should take ten minutes to jot down a series of points showing the activities in their constituencies which are proceeding.Given the problems being experienced in the construction sector, it is important the Government continues to progress the national development plan.  Previous Governments adopted a simplistic approach and abandoned capital investment projects when they encountered cashflow difficulties or a deficit.  This approach causes major problems because necessary infrastructure is not in place when the economy improves.  The Government is proceeding with its capital investment programme, albeit at a slightly slower pace than envisaged.  We must prioritise and postpone rather than abandon certain projects.  This means it may take seven years rather than five years to complete projects under the national development plan.  In view of the current economic circumstances, this is not a bad position.People need certainty that projects will proceed, provided it can be shown that they will provide short-term or long-term economic benefits.  This has been the priority of the Government in the national development plan.While Deputies may find some of the issues I raise marginally parochial, lessons can be learned from the topics I propose to discuss because public representatives deal with identical issues every week.  They are, therefore, as relevant in other areas as they are in my constituency.  I will focus, in particular, on how the national development plan will affect County Laois.  In the Estimates for the coming year, the National Roads Authority, under the aegis of the Department of Transport, will proceed at full tilt with the construction of the M7 and M8 motorway projects.  This project will deliver high class motorways linking Dublin and Limerick and Dublin and Cork, respectively.  The projects, both of which include construction in County Laois, have been under way since earlier this year.Given that discussion of routes and other issues commenced in 1999 and there have been no unforeseen delays in the intervening period, it baffles me that a contract for the motorway project in my county was not signed until 2007.  While I accept that work done at the early stages means fewer difficulties will arise in the long term, I fail to understand the reason that the design and planning stage of projects account for at least 80% of their timescale, whereas the construction element is squeezed, concertina-like, into the final 20% of the project lifetime.  Be that as it may, tremendous work is taking place on the motorway project which is worth several hundred million.  The project is coming into full swing and early this year, a headcount revealed that 1,400 people were employed on the contract while 14 different items of plant and equipment, ranging from the largest cranes in the State to JCBs and forklift trucks, were in operation.The reason for the project is not only to provide employment but to link our major cities.  I am a fan of motorways.  One of the factors overlooked in the debate about these routes is their contribution to road safety.  Many of the main causes of road traffic accidents — I refer to collisions during overtaking manoeuvres or at busy junctions rather than the single vehicle accidents which occur late at night at weekends — are removed when motorways are constructed.  In the past ten years, 12 fatalities have occurred on the stretch of the N7, a national primary route, within 1.5 miles of my home in Castletown.  I remember each and every incident and the principal reason they occurred is that the N7 is a busy, two-way road.  I look forward to the opening of the new motorways as drivers will no longer meet oncoming traffic when overtaking and they will be served by graduated junctions and properly constructed roundabouts rather than dangerous junctions at crossroads.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	473	In the past year, my locality experienced two tragedies when pedestrians were killed by trucks on the main streets of Mountrath and Abbeyleix, respectively.  One of the victims was a young child while the other was an elderly lady.  It should no longer be necessary to drive trucks through small towns.  Motorways are needed to bypass these towns and improve safety for their residents as they travel to school, visit post offices or do their shopping.  One cannot overstate the contribution motorways make to road safety.The Estimates and financial package placed before the House for consideration for next year include hundreds of millions of euro allocated directly to the motorway projects.  The sting in the tail is the imposition of a toll at a point south of Portlaoise.  People may complain about tolls but it is not a big deal to pay a couple of euro in exchange for being able to travel on a safe road.I will now address the impact of the national development plan on schools.  Two new secondary schools are to be built in Portlaoise under public private partnership projects, with two further new schools scheduled for construction in County Offaly.  The approved contractor is an Australian company, Macquarie Construction in partnership with the Irish company, Pierse Construction.  The Minister, I understand, will be able to formally announce the commencement of construction in the coming weeks.  I understand funding is in place and that the project has gone through the rigours of the National Development Finance Agency.  Those two secondary schools in Portlaoise will be under construction in 2009, if not beforehand.  They will replace the two old schools in the town.  Only last year the then Minister for Education and Science opened Portlaoise College, which is part of Laois VEC.  It will be one of the few towns where the three secondary schools will have been built within a five-year period.  There will be no old school in the town in the next couple of years and we shall have the most modern set of secondary schools in Portlaoise of any town.  That is an achievement and the funding is in the financial package in front of us.In addition, I want to acknowledge that there is a major amount of money there for a project that is particularly close to my heart, the new community school in Mountrath, a mile from where I live.  That involves the amalgamation of the Ballyfin secondary school, which is closing next year, the Brigidine convent school in Mountrath and the St. Aonghus vocational school into one new state-of-the-art school, which we hope will be ready for students to move into on 1 September 2009.  Construction commenced on that in the second half of this year, there is a very tight timeframe and I look forward to work progressing.  Funds are in the Estimates this year to allow that project to be completed and opened next September.As regards primary schools, only a few weeks ago I introduced to the Minister representatives from Abbeyleix national school, who want to open the first autism unit in County Laois.  There is no such facility in the county and children with autism basically have to go Athy or Offaly, where there are excellent schools.  I am very pleased, however, that Abbeyleix school has agreed to take on board a new autism unit for County Laois and that, I hope, will get the go ahead.  The Minister was extremely sympathetic to the case and I expect a positive result in that regard.  In the event, that school will be in construction early in 2009 as well.  There is real activity on the ground.  These are things that matter to people at local level.I am appealing to the Minister, if he has funding, to support these projects, also.  I expect Borris-in-Ossory, Rathdowney and Killeshin national schools to go to construction next year and planning to be advanced for the new primary schools in Portlaoise.  These will not be ready for construction next year, as the design process is just being commenced and they will have to go through planning and tendering.  The construction period will follow all that.  However, these are among the tremendous projects that will happen in County Laois in 2009 and I am very pleased about that.Also provided for in the Estimates under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs — I am very pleased the Minister has confirmed he will be announcing funding — is the new rural development and social inclusion programme.  I have not got the exact title the Department uses for that programme, but it will be announced by the Minister in the coming weeks.  In County Laois we have had the Laois Leader company and two social inclusion companies, one called Portlaoise Community Action Project in Portlaoise and Mountmellick Development Association's social inclusion programme.  Those organisations have agreed, with considerable difficulty and negotiation, to come together to form one county structure for Laois, to deliver social inclusion and rural development programmes.  That work is being completed at local level and the Minister has the full funding in his Estimates for the coming year to give the projects the go-ahead.  I look forward to all those improvements taking place in terms of social inclusion and rural development under the new programme and again, funding is in place.Moving to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I am pleased that funding is available under the water services programme.  There is a significant increase in the water services investment programme for 2009, with very good reason.  We need to improve the water quality in some of the towns and villages.  Some small villages do not have sewerage schemes at all and some of the smaller towns have schemes that were built 60 or 70 years ago which have outgrown the capacity of the sewerage treatment plant.  The group town scheme, involving the upgrade of water, sewerage and treatment plants in Abbeyleix, Rathdowney, Durrow, Mountrath, Stradbally and Clonaslee, is in one bundle.  We all know the Department likes to bundle groups for a design, build and operate scheme and they are ready and at the tendering stage.  I expect that project to get the go-ahead, based on the level of increased funding within the Department for water treatment facilities.  Similarly, I want to see the group village sewerage scheme advanced through the design and tender stage, to include places such as Castletown, Ballynakill, the Swan and Timahoe.  I expect that to progress in 2009.  The construction will not take place in 2009, but will follow in due course when the preparatory work is finished.Then at local level, there are the smaller schemes.  Work has commenced and will be ongoing in 2009 and paid for in the funds provided in the Estimates before us for the Ballycleary group water scheme, to allow 50 houses, all with wells but without water at the edge of Castletown village, to be connected to the public mains; and an extension to Moyad, which is an addition to the Swan water scheme.  These projects will all happen, work has commenced but the funding will have to be met out of the 2009 Estimates to allow them to be completed.In terms of child care, the list goes on.  There is an allocation of funding for a new child care facility at Killadooley, halfway between Borris-in-Ossory and Rathdowney and also a new town, near the Laois-Carlow border, and that is proceeding as well.  I know the budget for housing is quite tight for the coming year, but work is under way by the voluntary housing agency, Respond!, to complete a housing programme in Mountrath.  That will be completed and finalised, including a new community facility for residents, in 2009.There is a good deal of affordable housing in County Laois that is for sale through the local authority, as well as many houses coming through the Part V process in 2009 for people who require social housing from Laois County Council, and I compliment the council.  It is one of the three counties in all of Ireland that has refused to take any funds at any stage under the Part V process.  It insisted on taking housing, whether social or affordable, on every housing development constructed in Laois in recent years.  We have increased housing stock available for people who need to buy under the affordable scheme or those applying under the social housing scheme.  I have met developers who were building houses in County Laois in different counties and they thought we were mad.  They said every other county allowed them to make a cash contribution in lieu of social housing, so why not Laois.  I encouraged the council to hold firm to its policy, as I still do, because it is the right one, and we have got houses.  We have one of the smallest housing lists in Laois of any county strictly because the local authority refused to budge on that principle and insisted on Part V houses all along.  In addition, people ask whether we have funding put aside for the rainy day in the future.  We have built up a substantial fund of development levies in County Laois for a major programme of works to be carried out by the local authority in the period ahead.If one looks at the Estimates, one sees there are increases in the key Departments, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children.  The increases may be small but they are there.  Some people might feel I have overdone the local issue, but the point is that the same applies to every constituency in every county.  If Deputies want to be negative, they will find nothing other than problems.  The script of this might make an appropriate newsletter for circulation in my constituency.  Before I sit down I shall have to think, in case I have left anywhere out.  The point is that this is the financial package the Government put forward on budget day.  I have not got time as I am sharing with my colleague, Deputy Dooley, who will start in a couple of minutes, but I could continue to go on about the positive aspects in relation to the financial measures and social welfare increases that were announced.  I shall leave others to do that, and in any event, they have been well covered.We all talk about the HSE and the need to cut out the administrators, reduce paperwork etc.  I have just come from the Committee of Public Accounts.  Before the committee were the chief executive and financial people from Beaumont Hospital.  I asked about the collection rate when people attended the accident and emergency unit there last year, excluding those on medical cards who did not have to pay.  The fee was €66 and it has increased in 2009.  The collection rate in Beaumont Hospital for those fees is only marginally over 50%.  In those hospitals the morning after someone visits an accident and emergency department, an invoice is typed up and sent out at the end of the month.  A reminder is then sent and another one a month later.  It eventually goes to a solicitor who sends another reminder but rather than face court costs, they just walk away from it.Coincidentally, the collection rate among those staying overnight in hospitals is up to 80%.  Seemingly, there is a better collection rate among those who must take up a hospital bed.  We should pass legislation in order that a person gives his or her PPS number when they go to an accident and emergency department.  It should be deducted from the person's salary at the end of the month.  That would eliminate all the paperwork and bureaucracy.  There would be a much higher collection rate.That is one practical example from this morning's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which could help to reduce administration and bureaucracy in the HSE.  I have much more to say but have run out of time.  I will hand over to my colleague Deputy Timmy Dooley.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I thank Deputy Seán Fleming for sharing time.The budget was set against a very difficult and different backdrop from budgets in recent years.  The international crisis, about which we talk so much and which perhaps many of us do not understand to the extent required, has put enormous pressure on governments and politicians throughout the world to react in the best way they can to address their economic circumstances.The crisis started in the banking sector and moved into the stock markets, so there has been a double impact.  Many people have not started to focus on the very particular impact it will have on this country, namely, on foreign direct investment, investment already here and on our capacity to retain employment at record levels.While many people are talking about a recession, it is almost like a virtual reality.  For many people, it is just talk because they have not experienced the level of crisis economies throughout the world are in.  It will take perhaps another six to eight months before people really appreciate how dire is the state of the finances not only of this country but of countries throughout Europe.While there may be much outcry at present about certain measures — many of them will be highlighted over the coming days and weeks — it seems people really have not come to terms with the state of affairs on a national and international basis.  People would find it a little easier to understand some of the decisions taken if they accepted that.The diminishing tax returns, which required the budget to be brought forward, was really the first indicator.  When the tax and capital gains tax returns are made in the middle of next month, it will bring into very sharp focus where the public finances stand.  What is most important is to put order on the public finances.  We all suffered in the past because governments on all sides failed to take the decisive action necessary.  We cannot allow that to happen again.The Opposition seemed to suggest that this budget was about attacking the young, the old and the low paid and that there was another target group, the high rollers.  This is the Joe Duffy mentality, namely, that there is a group of high rollers which one can target.  The truth is that the bulk of the tax take comes from middle income earners who are being stretched.  When one looks at their income limits versus the income limits which are talked about loosely, one will see the pressure which is on so many people with high mortgages, child care costs, the cost of travelling to work, the cost of education and the cost of raising a family.  The Opposition seemed to suggest that we should target these people but it will not come out and say that.  There are not enough high rollers about which it talks.  If we took the entire earnings of the so-called "multimillionaires", it would not pay to keep anything going.  It is important people are honest and that they set out clearly from whom they want to take extra money to shore up the public finances and to get us back on an even keel.The other misconception floating about is that we bailed out the banks.  We have thrashed this around the House fairly well but the Joe Duffy show seems to think we bailed out the banks and propped up property developers.  This has become common currency.  While it is completely untrue, there is a belief that is the case.There is also the notion that Fianna Fáil-led Governments blew our success in the good times.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	478	In County Clare alone, the Ennis by-pass was built as well as the N18 to Shannon Airport.  There were improvements to the N18 from Limerick through to Bearfield.  The next phase of the work will bypass Bearfield, Crusheen and Gort to connect with Galway.  Significant sums of money have been spent upgrading the infrastructure in the airport.  Money has been spent on water and sewerage schemes in Liscannor, Feakle, Quilty, Tuamgraney and so on.  That is where the investment has gone.  That is not blowing the money.  I am not suggesting Deputy Quinn said that but others have done so.  That is investing for the future.People have said we did nothing when we had surpluses and we did not squirrel the money away.  Investing in infrastructure is squirrelling it away.  It is putting in place the capacity for this country to continue to develop into the future.  I do not believe that is a waste nor do I believe it was a waste for us to put significant funding into some of the smaller rural schools to maintain population in those areas.  I do not want to list them but there are many.  However, there is still work to be done.  Ennis boys' national school needs to be completed and I hope the Minister will be able to accommodate that next year.  School upgrades are needed in Bearfield and Quin and I hope that can be done.  Many schools throughout County Clare have been upgraded.The Department of Health and Children has provided funding for day care centres.  It has been suggested that we do not look after the elderly.  We got it wrong in regard to the medical cards, we apologised and we are putting that right.  Funding has gone into day care centres to allow people to remain in their homes and yet have contact with health care professionals and people in their community.  It allows them to have a quality of life in their latter years.Today the Minister for Health and Children gave €70,000 to a community group in my area to provide a bus to bring people from isolated areas to a centre five days a week.  That is investment and if that is blowing money, I am missing something in terms of my capacity to represent the people who elected me to this House.Clearly, there are fewer resources and we need to make some difficult choices.  We must target the resources at those most in need.  There was a time when it was possible for an element of luxury in terms of what we did because the resources were there but, unfortunately, that is no longer the case.  Perhaps the public is not as focused on that as it will be in the coming months.Many people in society — the number will increase — depend solely on the State to survive and we need to focus on them.  The State must be in a position to help them.No economist forecast that this downturn would come about.  The market dislocation which took place in the United States, initially through the sub-prime crisis, instilled fear and created uncertainty.  Anyone who has any understanding of the financial markets knows that fear and uncertainty are the principal drivers for a market collapse, which is what we have seen.  There are companies whose asset base far outweighs their market capitalisation at present.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	480	We are a small economy on the hind teat of Europe.  Unfortunately, economic pressures probably affect us more quickly than France, Britain and Germany which have populations of 50 million to 60 million.  It took them much longer to get the type of growth rates from which we benefited.  Clearly, we will experience the downturn more quickly because of the size of our population.Certain people in the Opposition put forward the notion that we should spend more, that this budget was measly and mean-spirited and that we should have taxed less and cut nothing.  Some people have the luxury to do that but, unfortunately, the Cabinet does not have that luxury.  There is a body of people looking to the Government to provide stability and an economic framework through which we can return to the kind of economic growth that will assist us in providing employment and a quality of life for future generations.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that have arisen in the budget, the broad budgetary framework exists to support that approach.  Some commentators suggest it may take longer to get back on track than originally expected, but we will get back on track.I recognise the important measures proposed in the budget, particularly from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in terms of the investment in our water services to ensure the quality of drinking water.  This measure is particularly helpful in my constituency for sewerage schemes in places such as Broadford, Clonlara, Curraclare and Labasheeda.  Also, in light of  much of the negative comment that has been made about the Department of Health and Children, the Minister has confirmed since the budget that the Ennis hospital upgrade will go ahead this year.  That demonstrates the commitment to providing for the health care needs of the people I represent.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	481	James Connolly, the founder of the Labour Party, appealed to those "whose interests are always on the side of progress".  Progress was a word he used a lot.  Many people would agree that the older people and students who protested yesterday and the teachers, children and parents who will protest next week are standing up for progress.The reduction in class sizes, universal access to medical cards for the over 70s and universal child benefit were all progressive moves.  Universal access to the medical card has meant better health and greater security for older people.  The introduction of free third level education by the Labour Party when in Government resulted in more people, from all socio-economic backgrounds, going to college.  Even groups whose participation in third level education had diminished before fees were abolished have increased their rate of participation.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	483	No it has not, as the statistics demonstrate.  The Minister of State should read the Clancy report on access to higher education.  The provision of better health facilities and good public transport would be progressive moves.  If we had made more progress with regard to infrastructure, as other countries did, over the past ten years when we had the money, we would all be more protected in this changing economic situation.To return to the protests in recent days, the image of the people involved would warm all hearts except those of Members on the Government side.  Older people and students supported themselves and each other.  They were not divided and ruled by the Government promises to increase the income limits.  Older people refused to be divided on the issue because it was about all of them as a community of older people.  Similarly, students supported older people.  The protesters were fighting for all of us as members of society and for progress and the good of all.I disagree with the points made by Deputy Dooley.  That we face economically difficult times is not reason enough to regress.  The day of reckoning has come for the Progressive Democrats as it winds up as a party. The Green Party has taken on that party's aggressive and divisive ideology, which is not concerned with social protection, fraternity or similar values.  Deputy Dooley talked about Government policy, namely, that in times of economic hardship one stops what one is doing and reverses.  If the Progressive Democrats had the same kind of influence in the next economic boom as it had in our recent boom, the boom would be about ensuring the wealthiest do best and money would not be put into universal services such as health care.  We would have private health care, thanks to Deputies Harney and Cowen and the rest of the Government.There are many examples of progress made by governments throughout the world, not just in Ireland.  The traditional Fianna Fáil, of which Deputy Conor Lenihan's father was part, made progressive changes.  However, things have changed in Fianna Fáil and it is no wonder there is unease among the strain in Fianna Fáil that has social progress in mind.  We can make progressive moves in times of economic hardship.  For example, the abolition of fees was funded by the abolition of a tax covenant break.  Basically, the money was taken from the wealthy and used to provide universal access to third level education.  Similar progressive measures should be taken now.  Even in more difficult times, measures were taken to improve social welfare benefits.One has only to look back through history to see what progressive measures have been taken in bad times.  We can do the same now.  The Labour Party has produced a document advising what can be done to help our economy, such as investing in school buildings.  Investing now will stand to us in the long term.  It is similar to the situation my parents were in some time back.  They were not well off, but they got a mortgage and invested in a house in which they raised their family.  That is how people manage.  Just because there is no money does not mean we cannot make progress.The Green Party is a regressive party.  Social progress and protection are not on its radar.  Environmental progress is not on its radar either.  I heard about Deputy Paul Gogarty's speech, but have not read it yet.  I am not surprised by what I have heard.  The Green Party is all talk, but talk is no use if one is not prepared to walk the walk.  The Green Party should have been prepared to walk as soon as it realised what was in the budget.  It should have said it would not vote for the budget unless the Minister removed the measures relating to the reduction in class sizes and the reduced access to medical cards.The Green Party is not progressive with regard to the environment either. The budget also provides less money for public transport and for landfill remediation.  The only reason the Green Party is in Government now is for the sake of being in Government.  The Green Party is no different from the Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil in Government.  The Green Party is regressive and will damage our environment and society while the Government lasts.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	484	It gives me no pleasure to speak on this budget, which was a failed budget as soon as the Minister sat down after his 45 minute speech.  It did not deal with the macroeconomic realities.  It is now a dead budget because, so far, two key expenditure items have been seriously altered, the income levy and the medical card fiasco.The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats ideological surge to the right has prevented them from abandoning the 5% nonsense associated with the medical cards.  They have bought in partly to the erosion of the principle of universality and its replacement with means testing.  This is back to the poorhouse mentality, which I never expected to see from Fianna Fáil, but it is here now and embedded in its core.I have some experience of budgets and was around the Cabinet table for the formulation of nine of them, participating as Minister for Finance in three.  This is a bad budget because it does not do the primary task with which it was charged.  It does not work.  Worse, the Minister's speech was a very poor budget speech, because it had no strategy, coherence, clear message or sense of direction.  The call for patriotic action at the end of it was the most cynical act I have heard in a long time in the House.Seán O'Rourke asked me to speak on "News at One" on the day of the budget.  What I said is in the public domain.  I said I was fearful.  I said that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was a very able and clever man as his academic track record will prove.  However, he is the youngest Minister in terms of experience around the Cabinet table.  He has no family or personal economic or commercial experience.  Sadly, because I like the man personally, when I sat down to hear the Budget Statement that reluctant analysis was borne out.  The budget content was worse than expected.  I have some experience in this area.  The budget speech was both structured and written by civil servants.  It clearly was never politically proofread.  Hence the 1% levy was announced as being on all income and not what the Government has now conceded.  The announcement about the medical cards for the over-70s was simply nonsense and we now have the unravelling day by day of the contents of that scheme.  We have yet to see the full impact of the series of depth charges that have been dropped into the ocean that is the primary, secondary and tertiary education sector.I say to you, a Chathaoirligh, as a professional accountant with some expertise in this area, that the Fianna Fáil reputation for sound macroeconomic management is clearly a myth that needs to be debunked.  Let me start as far back as 1977 with the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of Jack Lynch, George Colley, Des O'Malley and Martin O'Donoghue.  I can recall in this House when the then Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech that total expenditure amounted to borrowing of 13% of GNP, there was a round of applause from the economically illiterate clowns on the Fianna Fáil benches on the far side.  Within two years we were in crisis to the extent that Charles Haughey mounted a coup and took over.  However, Mr. Haughey was even worse than Mr. Lynch, who was economically illiterate.  Mr. Colley's problem was that he was too honest and he actually implemented the promises contained in the manifesto for the election Fianna Fáil never expected to win.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I say to Minister Lenihan-light that I will deal with that when I have more time.  I am giving the statistics of macroeconomic management.  Charles Haughey refused to deal with it and John Wilson was dispatched to give an increase to the nurses that was unsustainable.  In the period from February 1982 to November of that year Mr. Haughey again refused to deal with the problems despite the exhortations of Ray MacSharry.  In the period from 1987 to 1989 Fianna Fáil began the painful macroeconomic correction, not because it wanted to do it, but because Alan Dukes delivered the Tallaght strategy and it had no choice.  From 1989 to 1992 Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, led by Des O'Malley, endured the currency crisis to which it had partially contributed but was not responsible.When I became Minister for Enterprise and Employment in January 1993, redundancies were occurring at the rate of 147 per week.  By the end of that 1992 to 1994 Labour and Fianna Fáil Government we were beginning to see the turnaround.  In the 1994 to 1997 rainbow Government we actually got in line to qualify to join the single currency, the euro, which transformed the country.  However, as somebody said to me, during the 1970s and 1980s we had needed to avoid the rollercoaster ride that was the currency fluctuation, to move from being Italians, Spaniards or French and obtain the discipline of German low interest rates and low inflation.  We got that with the single currency.Unfortunately Charlie McCreevy as Minister for Finance continued to behave like an Italian, not recognising that there were now constraints preventing us from adjusting for inflation or for non-competitive costs by the devaluation of our currency.  Nor did we have an independent central bank to correct us when we made mistakes.  We had the ludicrous reduction in capital gains tax that boosted the economy.  At one stage we were growing at 11% per annum.  I know the Acting Chairman cannot participate in this debate, but he can reflect upon it.With the infrastructural constraints we had in the economy at that time, the boost in economic activity to that extent was such that the construction industry was destroyed in the following way.  We all remember it.  People were saying that they did not want to know how much it would cost, they just wanted to know when the builder could start.  That was the beginning of the demise of the construction industry as a competitive component of our economy.  The first part of the Celtic tiger, which I am happy and proud to say I played some part in creating and which was handed over to Charlie McCreevy, was blown away.  The blowing away only happened after 2002, as independent economic commentators will confirm.Unfortunately this budget is in the same tradition of 33 years of economic mismanagement.  It simply will not work.  We will be back next year facing more difficult problems, confronting issues the extent of which we do not know at this time.  The reality is that we have failed utterly to recognise the constraints within which we find ourselves, which are also the safeguards that have saved us from going down the path on which the Republic of Iceland has found itself.  If we were still an independent economy with a separate currency this country would now be bankrupt.  Some 300,000 people in Iceland have got permission to borrow $6 billion from the IMF and World Bank to rescue their economy.  They will be in debt for generations as a result of the mismanagement of their economy and the hubris regarding how it might operate.  That is the extraordinary legacy we will get from Fianna Fáil.I propose to nominate the following extract for either the Booker prize or the Myles na gCopaleen literary award.  Perhaps my Fine Gael colleagues might listen to this because if somebody can understand this and better still implement it they deserve a medal.  This, along with the levy for car parking spaces, is the contribution of the Green Party.From 1 January 2009, the provision of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers to employees who agree to use the bicycles to travel to work will be treated as a tax-exempt benefit-in-kind.  This tax exemption may only apply once in every 5-year period in respect of any one employee.  There will be a limit of €1,000 on the amount of expenditure an employer can incur in respect of any one employee.  The scheme may also be implemented via salary sacrifice arrangements, whereby an employee agrees to forgo part of her or her salary to cover the costs associated with the purchase of the bicycle and associated safety equipment.  Where such salary sacrifice arrangements are implemented they must be completed over a maximum period of 12 months.A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you were once the occupant of the Custom House.  It may come as a surprise, but not to you, to learn that so was Myles na gCopaleen, also known as Flann O'Brien.  I am delighted to see his spirit is alive and well and he is on his bicycle.  The sooner they get on their bicycles the better.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I refer to the reply to Question No. 68 of 9 July 2008 in which I indicated that, since publication of the current national climate change strategy, work has continued across Departments on the development of further measures to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions.  I also pointed out that, under the direction of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, Departments have intensified their work on developing measures both for the Kyoto period and the longer term and, in that respect, work towards a new national climate change strategy is under way.Ireland will meet its EU commitment for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol.  While the latest data from the EPA point to a greater challenge than was previously projected, I stated in my carbon budget speech last week that the gap will have to be bridged by a combination of further measures and the purchase of carbon credits under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.  While this is a valid response, I have made it clear that the use of carbon credits must be supplementary to emission reductions and that we must not, under any circumstances, allow the option to purchase credits to deflect from the fundamental objective of taking the necessary actions towards a low-carbon trajectory in the longer term.The carbon budget drew together the key national responses to greenhouse gas emission reductions for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol and beyond.  Some responses will deliver emission reductions in the short to medium term but the longer term is even more important.  The level of structural change needed to underpin a transition to a low carbon economy cannot be achieved overnight and my priority in the carbon budget was to put in place the type of drivers that are needed, such as the new 40% target for electricity from renewable sources, to achieve the objective as quickly as possible in a longer-term context.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The work is ongoing and I introduced the concept of a carbon budget in order that the Opposition and outsiders could see the progress we are making on the climate change strategy.  As the EPA is better resourced, it has more accurate projections.  Despite that, we achieved a 1% reduction last year.  My ambition is greater than that and I would like a 3% annual reduction but that is a start.The Deputy asked about specific measures.  We introduced VRT and motor tax measures, which the Deputy and his party opposed.

He recently stated he is not the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Minister for Transport and he called on his colleagues to do something to meet the programme for Government commitment.  He does not know much about collective Cabinet responsibility.  The Minister has a key position in the Government to achieve the goals he talked about for long enough.  Let us see the colour of his money.When we are given the details regarding the introduction of a carbon levy, we will be glad to scrutinise it then.  We will be glad to scrutinise any ministerial proposal.  Will the Minister indicate in the context of the cutbacks in public transport, how he will achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to meet the targets, which are important?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The Deputy is correct that this is about collective Cabinet responsibility and we must act responsibly collectively.  Everybody has a role to play and everybody must step up to the plate.  The Deputy is correct to identify the agriculture and transport sectors.  The agriculture sector is responsible for more than 28% of our emissions and 40% in the non-ETS sector, which is incredible.  That is unique to Ireland, as no other European country produces that level of emissions.  Similarly, emissions in the transport sector are escalating.I stated in my carbon budget that it must be ensured we introduce a sustainable transport plan and I will work closely with the Minister for Transport in this regard.  The sustainable transport action plan contains many initiatives, which will encourage greater bus use.  People will be given real time information about the arrival of a bus.  Most commuters will welcome this because the difficulty they face currently is they do not know when the next bus will arrive.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The total expenditure on the development and roll-out of the electronic voting system to date is some €51.3 million, the bulk of which has been incurred on the purchase of the voting machines and ancillary equipment.  In addition, based on figures received in my Department from returning officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment, including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 were €658,000, €696,000, €706,000 and €489,000, respectively.  Provisional data from returning officers indicate that a total of some €139,000 was expended on storage in the first six months of 2008.In 2007, more than 60% of the electronic voting machines or a total of 4,762 were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are €328,000.  These are largely one-off costs related to the preparation of the facility, transportation of the machines and the acquisition of storage containers.  The available capacity at this location has been fully utilised.  It was reasonable to make adequate and appropriate provision for the storage of the machines.  The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was, therefore, the right approach, taking into account a range of factors, including the costs of the previous and the centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.As regards the project itself, I am considering the next steps to be taken in regard to the electronic voting and counting system.  I am taking into account the detailed work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.  Given the scale of investment in the system to date, which I have set out, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  The House will appreciate it is not possible to make more specific comment at this point pending completion of the necessary work and a decision by Government in the matter.

In a week in which the House addressed the issue of medical cards, this might appear to be a small matter, but it is significant.  Last week, the Minister cheerlead on the benches and gave the budget a standing ovation.When I raised this matter in May, the Minister gave an identical response.  The commission completed its report more than two years ago and the recommendations are before us.  Due to the Minister's inaction at the time and his inability to make a decision, I suggested he consider giving responsibility to someone else, with the matter reverting to the Dáil after six months with an ultimate decision on whether e-voting would be pursued and used at the local and European Parliament elections next year.The Labour Party's position is clear — the project should be scrapped, but we would have facilitated the Minister bringing alternative opinions to the table.  None has been proposed.  The Minister stands before the House this afternoon——

The Minister does not have a plan.  He is prevaricating and sitting on the issue.  Public money is being squandered, yet the Minister has not responded to a matter raised with him six months ago.

I do not doubt that Deputy Ciarán Lynch would have been on the plinth screaming about the waste of money.  He is only awaiting the opportunity.It is a complex issue.  I am pleased to report that the amount of money being expended has decreased, including significantly reduced storage costs.  I am aware of people's discontent with the project.  As the Deputy stated, it is a legacy issue and I am trying to address it as comprehensively as possible.  Previously, I indicated to the Deputy——

We must consider all the issues and I have been in discussions on the matter.  A report on the Electoral Commission is almost complete, which must also examine this issue.  All of these concerns must be considered before a comprehensive decision can be made.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The recently published fourth state of the environment report states there are between 1,980 and 2,300 commercial sites where there is the potential for soil or underground contamination, the exact number being unknown as there is currently no national inventory.  Two national initiatives are under way to establish such inventories of historic mines and unregulated waste disposal sites.  Regulations in the latter category are at an advanced stage of preparation and will provide a legal framework for remediation of high risk waste disposal sites where municipal waste was disposed of in the period 1977-96.  Ireland is also supportive of the proposed EU soils directive, which intends to put in place particular requirements for member states regarding historic contaminated land.The position in respect of Haulbowline is exceptional in that my Department is addressing a specific Government decision in taking responsibility for the care and maintenance of that unique site, pending a decision on its future use.  This is the only such site currently subject to any investigations or reports by my Department.  In addition, the Department re-engaged consultants White Young Green to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions following extensive unauthorised works earlier this year.  In 2005, White Young Green carried out an extensive intrusive site investigation that indicated no evidence of any immediate threat to human health or the environment.  Test results will be assessed against baseline data from the previous survey.At the request of local residents and public representatives, I have arranged for the current ongoing site assessment works and the 2005 report to be peer reviewed by independent experts to offer reassurance to local communities that the scope of works, tests and analyses employed conform to best international practice in determining whether the site poses any immediate health or environmental threat.  Both the White Young Green and peer review reports will be published once my Department has received and considered them.  I anticipate the reports will be publicly available within a matter of weeks.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Minister has confirmed that the Haulbowline report will be published in a few weeks and that its peer review, which is presumably still in draft form, is ongoing.The Minister alluded to a serious matter raised in the Environmental Protection Agency's state of the environment report, namely, that between 1,980 and 2,300 sites could pose risks to ground water.  What will be the cost of the sites' remediation, what action does the Minister intend to take to deal with the risk to ground water and public health and has the Department conducted a cost evaluation?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	525	A risk assessment has been carried out and a code of practice produced.  In 2007, the Office of Environmental Enforcement published a code of practice for environmental risk assessments of unregulated waste disposal sites.  The code sets out a risk-based procedure that should be applied to sites identified in accordance with sections 22(7)(h) and 26(2)(c) of the Waste Management Act 1996.  The code provides the framework to establish the intrinsic risk posed by old and previously unregulated sites.The intention is to make regulations that would provide a mechanism for the remediation of old municipal waste disposal sites that operated between 1977 and 1996.  These regulations will be completed shortly and will apply to an estimated 300 sites, which take priority over the other estimated 2,300 commercial sites where the holder of the waste, defined in legislation as the waste's producer or the natural or legal person in possession of it, has the responsibility not to "hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution".  This duty is set out in section 32 of the Act.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I would have expected the Department, through the EPA, to have identified the sites in question, numbering between 1,980 and 2,300, and the costs arising for the Department in terms of an action plan in each case.  Otherwise, we are saying to the public that we are satisfied to allow a situation to continue where ground water is contaminated.  We will have more problems with the water supply in the future if we do not deal with these issues now.  Has the Minister plans to deal as soon as possible with the sites that have been identified?  Will he set up a national inventory of all sites which have not yet been identified?  I understand it is difficult to get a handle on all the sites.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	527	There is an acceptance that a proper inventory of contaminated sites is the least that is required.  Two inventories are currently being completed.  The first relates to old mines and is being prepared by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the EPA.  It is expected to be published before the end of the year.  The second relates to old municipal waste disposal sites which will be required to be identified by 30 June 2009.  While the Department does not hold a list of sites that may require remediation, the sites at which the types of activities which potentially give rise to environmental legacy issues occurred include mines, railway yards, petrol stations, oil depots, gas works and chemical and other industrial installations.Activity in this area is also under way at EU level.  Under a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the European Council establishing a framework for the protection of soil, various initiatives are proposed which may require, inter alia, the identification and remediation of old contaminated sites.  Ireland is supportive of this proposal, but our support is measured in that we are anxious to have a long lead-in time for the transposition and implementation given current financial and budgetary constraints.

The most recent report for the years 2006 and 2007 is available in the Oireachtas Library.Management of public drinking water supplies to ensure compliance with water quality standards is the responsibility of each local authority.  I have put in place a rigorous supervisory framework to ensure good quality drinking water is available, and effective mechanisms exist to deal quickly and effectively with problems where they arise.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007, local authority drinking water supplies are subject to supervision by the EPA.  I have given the agency the necessary resources to back up its new enforcement powers.Each local authority is legally required to ensure that any failure to meet quality standards in its water supplies is investigated immediately to determine the cause.  The authority is also obliged to inform the EPA promptly and to consult with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Where incidences of contamination occur the EPA can issue such directions to the local authority as necessary to prevent or remove any health risk.  Failure to comply with such a direction is an indictable offence and subject to heavy penalties.I understand the EPA is liaising with the HSE and the relevant local authority in regard to all reported lead exceedances.  Where exceedances have been reported, the EPA has requested the local authority, inter alia , to clarify the ownership and composition of the service pipe, provide details of the short-term and long-term measures to deal with the exceedance, provide details of advice from the HSE and clarify whether the owner of the premises has been given appropriate advice.A record provision of €560 million, an increase of 19% over 2008, will be available for water services investment in 2009.  This is the clearest possible statement by the Government of the priority given to ensuring that water and waste water treatment schemes comply with the highest standards.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	529	The current maximum level for lead in water is 25 micrograms per litre, with a reduction in this figure to ten micrograms per litre by 2013.  In view of the various instances of lead contamination of the water supply throughout the State and notwithstanding the welcome increase of 19% in provision for water services investment, is the Minister satisfied he will have sufficient resources to ensure we meet our requirements by 2013 and that we will not end up dealing with this matter in the usual way, by paying fines to the European Commission?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I am confident that the record investment of €560 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 19%, in water services and infrastructure will allow us to make the necessary progress.  The national development plan includes the objective of ensuring that "good quality drinking water is available to all consumers of public and group water supplies in compliance with national and EU drinking water standards, including any infrastructural improvements required to meet the 2013 parameter for the presence of lead in drinking water".  Against the backdrop of the most difficult budgetary situation in decades, we have provided a record provision for water services and infrastructure.  The Department is providing substantial funding of €288 million towards local authorities' water conservation programmes.  It is open to each authority to prioritise any necessary pipe replacement works under these programmes in order to eliminate lead piping in the public water supply and deal with current and future lead standards.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The EPA's report on drinking water published last January indicated that 339 schemes out of a total of 994 are contaminated.  The Minister will require substantial resources to rectify this problem.  Will he engage with the local authorities in regard to the manner in which schemes are approved and, where the money is allocated, the length of time it takes before a waste water treatment system or water scheme is rolled out?  It currently takes some four and a half years with the toing and froing that goes on in regard to design, detailed design and so on.  Has the Minister any plans to expedite the process by which this money is drawn down so that work can get under way as quickly as possible?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I assure the Deputy that we have tried to telescope the timeframe involved by significantly reducing the number of criteria.  I have spoken to the local authorities about this issue.  Whereas cuts have been made in other areas, I was anxious that we continue and increase the investment in the water services programme.  Were the impetus to be lost in terms of investment, the programme could be set back considerably.  I am satisfied that the programme of investment in drinking water infrastructure and waste water treatment plants will continue.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	533	In 2009, some €1.6 billion will be available for allocation via the local government fund.  General purpose grants are the contribution my Department makes to local authorities to meet the gap between the cost to them of providing a reasonable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  A total of €935.2 million in general purpose grants will be provided to local authorities from the local government fund.The fund also provides significant funding to local authorities for the improvement and maintenance of local and regional roads.  An amount of €564.5 million has been allocated to the Department of Transport from the fund for 2009 for this purpose.  An additional amount in the region of €80 million will be allocated for particular purposes including the operation of water services, group water schemes and the vehicle registration unit.General purpose grants are important in assisting local authorities to balance their budgets.  However, they comprise only about one fifth of the funding required by authorities to provide their day-to-day services, although the proportion varies between authorities.  Local authorities receive income from a range of sources including rates, charges for goods and services, specific State grants and general purpose grants from the local government fund.  It is a matter for each local authority to prioritise its spending within the resources available to it, across the range of services it provides.  Equally, local authorities must ensure full value for money for the resources invested and seek the maximum efficiency across their operations.  I am satisfied that the general purpose allocations provided for 2009, together with the income available from other sources, will enable local authorities to provide an acceptable level of service to their customers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The Minister will be aware that the local government fund is down 5% on what it was last year.  Also, there has been a 6% reduction in the Estimates for local government despite the fact that a 5% decrease was provided for in the Estimates volume pre-budget.  I am not sure if the amount has been subtracted from or added to since then.  We will not know the position until the Finance Bill is published.Will the Minister clarify if he proposes to prioritise additional resources for the home improvement scheme for the elderly and disabled and for the adaptation grants scheme, which is under pressure in each local authority area?  Every local authority has received a flood of applications in this regard.  We should either allow people in the local authority system to issue letters of approval in order that works can be undertaken or we should scrap the scheme.  While I acknowledge the scheme is now much more attractive, following changes introduced last year, funding has not been increased and this has resulted in a huge backlog of applications.  Whereas previously people could get only a €5,000 to €6,000 grant, they can now get up to €20,000.Does the Minister plan to encourage the rationalisation of quangos across the board in other Departments or at local level in an effort to make savings?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	535	First, I must correct the Deputy in respect of his estimate of the reduction in the local government fund for 2009.  Some €1,580 million is available to the local government fund in 2009, a reduction of 1.4% when compared to the total of €1,603 million expected in 2008.The Deputy may have been referring to the general purpose grants for which I will now provide the figures.  The total amount allocated to general purpose grants for 2009 is €935.2 million, a reduction of 6.4% on the record amount of €999.2 million allocated in 2008.  The Deputy also asked about a number of matters which come within the bailiwick of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran.I am trying, as best I can, to ensure a sound economic base for local government.  The Deputy will be aware the current system is strange in that part of the money received from motor taxation goes to local government.  This is one of the reasons — I was up-front about this — for the increase in motor tax which will go to the local government fund.  This measure was actually opposed by the Fine Gael Party.

We are commencing the process this year with the introduction of the €200 levy on second properties, some of which are holiday homes.  It is hoped this will net €40 million, although the final amount could be higher.  This is an innovation which I hope will start the process of broadening the financial base for local government.  I agree with Deputy Hogan that there is too much of a burden on some rate payers.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13 and 50 together.As indicated during the debate on budget 2009, it is important that the ongoing process of correction in the housing market is not artificially interfered with.  Given that sentiment in the housing market is heavily dependent on wider sentiment in the economy, the Government's approach is focused on the broader economic fundamentals and on ensuring, ultimately, that the housing market is underpinned by these.Any housing specific interventions must be targeted in nature and designed to achieve specific outcomes.  The announcement in the Budget of the introduction, for a limited period, of the new home choice loan product for certain first-time buyers is fully in line with this policy.  It is designed to respond, in a targeted way, to a very specific set of circumstances in the housing market whereby prospective first-time buyers, who would previously have been in a position to access mortgage finance from one of the financial institutions are not currently in a position to do so due to the impacts of the credit crunch.  The initiative provides no incentive to enter the housing market; it will merely facilitate certain first-time buyers who have decided to purchase a home at this time.Home choice will be available to first-time buyers of new houses, subject to a maximum loan of €285,000, depending on income, and a maximum loan to value ratio of 92%.  The loan term will be up to 30 years.  A minimum income of €40,000 will be required and a detailed credit policy is now being finalised.  A single standard variable interest rate product, related to the prevailing rates available from commercial institutions, will apply.  All applications will be rigorously assessed having regard to an applicant's ability to pay, credit history and all other aspects of the formal lending policy.  An applicant's ability to pay will be also stress-tested to assess ability to repay at current rates and in the event of significant interest rate rises.The scheme applies to new houses because a significant majority of first-time buyers purchase new houses.  The average cost of a new house is almost 14% lower than that of second-hand houses and, as such, it was considered appropriate to target the scheme towards properties which are more affordable for first-time buyers.  I do not anticipate this will have an appreciable impact on house prices nor do I think it will do anything to distort the market correction.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The Fine Gael Party is concerned about any type of intervention in the housing market.  I accept the Minister of State believes this measure will not result in any intervention in the market.Our main concern is why this measure applies only to new and not second-hand houses.  This, to us, appears to be a bail-out of the property developers.  There should be no intervention in the market at a time when it is declining and prices are falling.  It is anticipated that prices will drop by a further 20% to 25% next year.  We want to ensure homeowners do not end up with negative equity.Also, the scheme sets a lower ceiling limit of €285,000 in respect of the purchase of a home.  We are concerned this too will result in intervention in the market.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain why the scheme is specifically tailored to new homes.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	555	The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  The new home choice loan cannot be construed in any way to be entering the sub-prime area.  This is a targeted approach for first-time buyers and there is no incentive.  It aims to deal with people who would have been able to get a loan in the past.  It is well known nationally that a person looking for a €300,000 mortgage, with financial institutions looking for 20 % as a deposit, would require €60,000.  We all know that is not feasible for young people today.  Our target is those who have already decided they want to buy a home, who have the necessary income to make repayments on a mortgage but do not have a €60,000 deposit.  We are facilitating a 92% loan to value mortgage.As to why we did not include second-hand houses, research indicates that over 70% of first-time buyers purchase new houses.  Information also indicates a differential of approximately 14% between the purchase of a new and second-hand house.  For that reason we have targeted new homes.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I wish to pick up on two or three specific areas, with the key point being the purchase of new or old builds.  An important point is that the ceiling of €285,000 is the determining factor, so it does not matter if the mortgage is taken on a new or old build.  That is the ceiling.  In welcoming this proposal, we should realise that it is an impetus which enables people to buy a home in a particular locality, be it new or old.  As there is a ceiling, there is no difference if the house is old or new.  The Minister of State's argument does not stand up with regard to the ceiling.  Because the scheme is specific to new builds, there is an impression that we are witnessing a bail-out.Another concern is highlighted by the Minister of State's reference to people who can only get an 80% loan to value mortgage from a bank.  Two things are happening at the moment.  House prices, although still overly expensive, are falling and it is becoming a buyer's market; and if a bank refuses a loan because it does not believe a person can make the repayments, the council is stepping in, with the implication of some private lending.  An exposure to risk is being created.Given that the Minister has set a ceiling, would it not be more appropriate in the roll-out of the scheme that the ceiling be the determining factor?  It should not matter if the scheme allows people to buy new or old builds.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I will take the matter of the intervention first.  I did not state it would apply to somebody who could not get a loan because he or she could not make the repayments.  I put on the record that this applies to people who are in a position to make repayments but do not have the 20% deposit.This has nothing to do with a bail-out of builders, involvement in the construction industry or a housing market correction.  It is a short-term measure to assist people who have already taken a decision to buy a house and who cannot get a mortgage because they not have the deposit.  We have targeted those people.Distinctions have been made in the past regarding new and second-hand homes.  There was an issue with the stamp duty which applied to first-time buyers of second-hand homes, and when the Government changed this some time ago some people felt it risked raising prices, which we do not want.  We do not want to get into raising the prices of homes or involving people in such a process.It is a targeted scheme without incentive.  It will be there for that category of people for six to 12 months and will be reviewed.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	558	The scheme's ceiling is seven times a person's salary, which seems grossly irresponsible, particularly in light of what has happened in the sub-prime market in the US.  Will the Minister of State give a reassurance that there will not be a repeat of what happened in the past?  What changes will be put in place to ensure all mortgages are properly stress-tested and that we return to a more traditional method of providing loans up to two and a half times salary?  That is much more prudent.  The introduction of this scheme could get us into trouble again.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I assure the Deputy and the House there is no question of seven times a salary being advanced.  The minimum income is €40,000 and the maximum loan is €285,000.  The rule of thumb which will be applied by the four designated local authorities and the central office, backed up by the Affordable Homes Partnership, is that approximately five times salary or less will be advanced.  The insurance is that the people involved must be in a position to make repayments that will not go above one third of salary.  That is a safety feature and an important part of the loan structure.  We are not putting people in a position where they will not be able to make repayments.  This loan is targeted at those who have the income to make repayments but who do not have the deposit.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I will clarify a few matters with the Minister of State.  The minimum earnings to qualify for the home choice scheme are €40,000 and there is no maximum.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	562	Is there a shelf life for the operation of the scheme?  Will it be for the next 12 months or will it go into the foreseeable future with an indefinite end point?  As there is no maximum earnings threshold and the maximum purchase price is €285,000, why is the purchase of old builds not being facilitated?  It does not make sense.  If somebody can purchase a house at that value in a declining market — this will be realised in the next six to 12 months — will the Minister of State not consider allowing old builds in the scheme?  If he does not, the clear implication is that this is a developer-driven product.

It is offered at a variable rate in the same way as a loan from any other financial institution.  The only difference is that it is targeted at a group of people and will have a loan to value of 92%.  There is no incentive and no intervention by Government or my Department in the construction industry.  If it has a plus, we will welcome that also.

The Bill clarifies the role of housing authorities in regard to the management of housing which they own or lease under the rental accommodation scheme or other arrangements.  This includes the power to determine rent and other charges in respect of such dwellings.  The Bill also provides for the making of a rent scheme to set out the manner in which rents will be determined.It does not introduce any new requirements in respect of the formation or employment of management companies.  Section 30 of the Bill provides that some or all of a housing authority's management functions may be delegated to a designated body.  Such delegation is confined to a body including residents and these powers already exist under section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.The question of the formation of management companies must be addressed in the context of developing proposals on the tenant purchase of apartments.  I hope to bring forward proposals in this regard during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I am uncertain as to what the Minister of State has just stated, because the legislation, which I have to hand, states that local authorities will be getting into the business of establishing management companies.  To push out the question further, will such management companies engage with matters such as the rental accommodation scheme?  I can envisage a scenario in which local authorities would operate management companies were the sale of flats scheme to be rolled out as there would be a need for them in such circumstances.However my question is simple.  The legislation states the Government will facilitate a scenario in which local authorities will get into the business of running management companies.  If my interpretation is correct, this is more likely to take place in the rental accommodation sector.  This will create three outcomes.  The first is an additional——

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I shall frame three questions.  Will this create an additional charge for tenants under the rental accommodation scheme?  How will the legislative framework for this measure be pitched?  Will it be included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill although regulation is still awaited in respect of the private management sector?  Third, although councils will be obliged to get into management, they will be unable to manage half an apartment block.  What will this mean for social integration and social housing?  If my understanding is correct, the only way this will operate is that one will have entire apartment blocks of rental accommodation scheme tenants.  That would constitute ghettoisation, not social integration.

Consequently, I assure the House there is no question of either my Department or the front-line Department reverting to the old position of having local authority estates.  Housing developments must be sustainable communities and this remains the policy of the Department.As for the new Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, it provides a more developed legislative basis for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  It provides for the general terms and conditions that should be included in local authority agreements with accommodation providers, as well as the terms to be provided in the tenancy agreement between the accommodation provider and the RAS tenant.  The Bill also provides for termination of these agreements and the payment of a rent contribution by the tenant to the housing authority.  The payment of this contribution by the tenant is an obligation of the tenancy agreement.  The Bill updates the powers of local authorities to specify rents, clarifying these cover both the rents of dwellings of their own and those which they lease, including arrangements made under the rental accommodation scheme.Moreover, when the Bill comes before the Dáil, I intend to incorporate a provision within it for a scheme for the purchase of apartments or flats.  This request has been on the table for a long time and we await some clearance from the Attorney General's office in this regard.  If this happens and hopefully it will, obviously it will give rise to a mix of public and private apartments and flats.  At that point, some form of arrangement will be required between the public and private sectors as regards the management for public areas, roofing and so on.

I have asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the delay in respect of the property services (regulatory authority) Bill many times, as well as raising the matter on the Order of Business.  What is the position regarding the cross-departmental committee that was set up by the Taoiseach?  Is the Minister of State in a position to provide Members with a progress report in this regard?  The legislation must be put in place as soon as possible.  This has gone beyond a joke because of the great number of apartment complexes nationwide.  While I recognise this is a complex area, the Tánaiste stated that it would be necessary to bring either a single Bill or an omnibus Bill through the Oireachtas to regulate such property management companies.  Meanwhile, although a regulator is in place, Members are not being provided with full information as to what work is going on in the background.  The Minister of State may be in a position to provide more information in this regard.

It pertains to the Companies Acts and is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, as the Deputy noted, a debate is taking place on this matter.  I understand the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring forward its proposals on this issue.  However, it is not a specific matter for my Department.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I have concerns about the provisions as outlined by the Minister of State because they will play into the hands of many, if not all, of the county managers.  My impression is that county managers wish to offload their responsibilities in respect of housing in so far as is possible.  They are attempting to off-load as much responsibility as possible onto voluntary housing agencies and this appears to be another method for so doing.  A mechanism will exist whereby management of housing can be dealt with by a management company, thereby absolving the councils of responsibility.  Many voluntary housing agencies do good work and I do not condemn them, although I have a bigger problem with management companies.  However, an issue arises in this regard pertaining to accountability.The best type of social housing is that which is directly built, provided, allocated and managed by county councils.  While I agree with the point about the need for integrated development, we have many successful council housing estates.  In the past the proportionate provision of council housing estates was much higher.  While only approximately 5% of what is built at present is council housing, the figure used to be up to 30%.  I am thinking of locations that have turned out excellently in Crumlin, Drimnagh, Lucan and so on.  These were old council estates that were directly managed and provided by the council that were occupied by working people, many of whom went on to buy their houses.I am worried about these proposals.  The management of South Dublin County Council——

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	583	First, I wish to reassure the Deputy on this matter.  At present, local authorities have certain powers under the 1992 Act, which they use in at least three ways that I can think of.  First, they use them when an estate gets together and decides to set up its own co-operative management.  This takes place in some, but not all, local authorities and works well.  In an estate of 20 or 30 houses, the householders may decide to set up a co-operative among themselves in respect of maintenance and so on.  Second, local authorities get involved in many other activities that are not necessarily their responsibility.  For example, they set up joint management companies in respect of leisure or tourism facilities.  Third, they also do so in respect of voluntary housing.  As the Deputy is aware, although my Department pays for it through the local authorities, in some cases the latter also have management responsibilities.These powers already exist and I will not extend them or provide other opportunities in this regard.  However, were we to proceed with the sale of flats, as I do not doubt we will, I would be obliged to make accommodation in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill itself.  For example, in a unit of 30 dwellings in which ten are purchased and 20 stay public, we will be obliged to enter into new arrangements.  I will be obliged in the Bill to give the power to local authorities to set up some form of management arrangement for such a scenario.  I intend to do so during the passage of the Bill.  However, the Deputy will have plenty of opportunities to discuss this matter during the debate.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Section 30 of the Bill states the Minister will empower local authorities to make charges for dwellings they do not own but which may be subject to a contract of a lease.  I understand this pertains to the rental accommodation scheme.  A management company or housing authority may pass on management and service charges to tenants.  This looks as though it will constitute an additional charge for people.The conundrum in this regard is that the legislative framework to require the sale of flats requires this provision.  Consequently, the Government has no inhibition in this regard.  Although the Minister of State has outlined the legislative framework to allow the sale of council flats to take place in this provision, he has not spotted that is the required legislative framework.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 19, 22, 29, 38 and 59 together.Ireland's Environment 2008, which is the Environmental Protection Agency's fourth state of the environment report, was launched by me on 8 October 2008.  It concludes that the quality of Ireland's environment is relatively good overall, although it is subject to increasing pressures as a result of the rapid expansion of our economy.  The report identified the following four key challenges for Ireland in the coming years: limiting and adapting to climate change; reversing environmental degradation; mainstreaming environmental considerations; and complying with environmental legislation and agreements.  The challenges are significant and we must do more to deal with them.Climate change is widely acknowledged as the most threatening global environmental challenge facing humanity.  I have detailed the Government's response to this challenge in my reply to Question No. 1 on today's Order Paper.While Ireland's water quality remains of a high standard, maintaining this standard is one of the most serious environmental challenges we face.  Implementation of the water framework directive, the nitrates action programme and the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 are key to securing and maintaining good water quality.  The highest ever level of annual funding, €560 million, is being made available for water services investment in 2009.  This is the clearest possible statement by the Government of the priority we are according to preserving and protecting our water resources as a key aspect of environmental quality.The EPA report refers extensively to the report, The Status of EU Protected Habitats and Species in Ireland, which I published in May 2008.  We are actively taking steps to maintain and restore habitats, particularly in protected areas.  This requires effective prioritisation, planning and execution, as well the full involvement of Departments, local authorities, landowners, farmers and other stakeholders.The EPA estimates the number of contaminated sites in Ireland at between 1,980 and 2,300.  Two national initiatives are under way on establishing inventories of historic mines and unregulated waste disposal sites.  I intend to introduce regulations to provide a legal framework for remediation of high risk waste disposal sites.Key drivers for environmental protection are EU environmental legislation and multilateral environmental agreements.  Some 200 items of EU environmental legislation, including more than 140 directives, have now been transposed into Irish law and are being implemented.  Ireland has also ratified a range of multilateral environmental agreements.  Compliance with environmental legislation is vital at national level and critical in terms of our commitment to working with the EU.The report recognises that air quality in Ireland is generally of a high standard.  The national programme on transboundary pollutants provides for the progressive reduction of these emissions by 2010 through a range of policies and measures in different sectors.One of my main priorities is to improve dramatically the manner in which we manage our waste.  The international review of waste management policy, which I have recently commissioned, will cover a wide range of issues to help identify how best to proceed with further efforts to reduce waste levels, improve recycling rates and deliver equitable and cost-effective waste management solutions.The programme for Government accords a high priority to environmental sustainability and the integration of environmental concerns into broader policy formulation.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Since coming into office, I have increased significantly the resources available to Comhar to undertake policy analysis across the broad range of issues in sustainable development, and the representation of environmental issues in social partnership will be addressed in the review of Towards 2016.Overall, it is a firm objective of Government to work towards a clean and safe environment for all.  The EPA report makes a major contribution to awareness and debate on the environment and sustainable development in Ireland.  It will inform and guide policy making and individual action in these areas over the years ahead.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	600	When she attended the Minister's launch, she stated: "We are not making headway and we are not progressing at the rate we need to."  The report described our environment as under threat.  In regard to the four key challenges, it found that under the most favourable scenario, Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions will exceed the proposed reduction target for 2020 by 7 million tonnes and that we will exceed the target by 1.4 million tonnes per year.  The biodegradable municipal waste diversion targets for 2016 will be missed by 800,000 tonnes.  Issues also arise in regard to landfill degradation.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	601	Does the Deputy have a question?
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	602	The report found that serious obstacles had arisen to progress.  That also appears to be the opinion of Dr. Kelly.What concrete steps is the Minister taking to address the challenges set out in the report?  There is a need for radical action now rather than in the future.  Biodiversity loss represents a serious threat to our environment and if we do not act now, it will be too late in the future.  Funding has been cut for the national parks and wildlife service which protects biodiversity.  Less money is available for landfill remediation.  The money for water services is welcome but the serious problems which have arisen in this regard have to be addressed.  Landfill pollution will also have a detrimental influence on water quality.  What concrete measures will the Minister implement over the next three years?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Deputy Tuffy is selective in quoting the comments of the director of the EPA at the launch because she went out of her way to thank me for the additional resources and staffing made available to the EPA.  In regard to the Deputy's question of what can be done now, I have provided for record increases in the EPA's resources and staff complement at a time of major budgetary constraints.  I did so because I wanted the best available data.  The EPA has produced several excellent reports.If I was to liken Ireland's environment to a student's report, I would say: "Not bad but could do a lot better".  I have never underplayed the state of the environment or the challenges we face in meeting our Kyoto commitments.  The EPA has projected that we are off target and has identified the agriculture and transport sectors in particular.  I have outlined the initiatives I have taken in these sectors.  I do not want to repeat myself because we can dwell too much on climate change.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The Minister should conclude.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	605	In terms of the water framework directive, which is very important, a total of eight river basin districts, RBDs, have been identified on the island.  Three of these are international RBDs in that cross-Border waters are shared with Northern Ireland, four are wholly within the State and one is wholly within Northern Ireland.  The environmental objectives of the directive are to be achieved through the implementation of the river basin management plans, which will include programmes of measures.  The Deputy has acknowledged the record increase of 19%, up to €560 million, which has been welcomed by local authorities.  This is the practical measure that I, as Minister, have introduced.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	606	The director may have thanked the Minister but she was just being polite because she was also critical when she said we were not making headway on the environment.  That is a major criticism if we have a Green Party Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  No progress has been made on climate change.  Nothing in the carbon report could be pinpointed.  The 1% reduction has nothing to do with the Minister.  If we reduce emissions in the coming years it will be because of the recession.  What is the Minister doing?  When will he make sure there are extra buses on the roads?  I do not refer to a sustainable transport plan but to buses on the roads.Will the Minister consider the Labour Party suggestion to set up a national forum on climate change to drive this issue?  It is not being driven and the Minister needs help from some body to get momentum.  Will the Minister consider abolishing carbon offsets and using the money for buses on the roads?

There is such a thing as constructive opposition.  When I was in opposition, if the Government did something good on climate change, my party supported it.  On a small initiative, such as the introduction of energy efficient light bulbs, Deputy Tuffy was first out of the traps——

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I published the Green Paper, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, in April 2008.  The Green Paper presents a set of options which share a common theme of strengthening local democratic leadership.  For example, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change proposes a regional mayor for Dublin to meet the strategic challenges the city faces.  The paper also suggests that local leadership, accountability and connection with the citizen would be achieved through the provision of directly elected mayors with key powers of initiative in other areas.  A suite of further proposals on issues such as town government, participative democracy, regional governance and service delivery are also included in the Green Paper.Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change represents the initial phase of a transparent, inclusive policy formulation process.  Its purpose was not to arrive at a single solution but to present options for further consideration.  Following the publication of the Green Paper, my Department conducted a public consultation process to inform the drafting of the White Paper.  The consultation process included a series of six regional seminars held over the summer, to gather as full a range of perspectives as possible.I am considering the outcomes of the consultation process, including the many written submissions I received.  I hope to finalise the White Paper on local government by the end of the year.  It is my intention to see a stronger, more vibrant and more accountable form of local government at the end of this process.

Will the Minister give details on how these will be administered and how the money will be collected?  Will he confirm that the money will be available for local authorities to spend?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I welcome any response to those questions.  The scheme cannot be implemented.  As someone who has served on a local authority, in opposition and in power, I refer to connectivity between national and local government.  Does the Minister see merit in the idea that strategic policy committees of local authorities, which should have a strategic role in the development of regions, would be better served by having Oireachtas Members from the area included?  This would be the same as policing committees facilitating Oireachtas Members.  Is this a consideration he will examine when drawing up the White Paper?

Broughan — the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to report to Dáil Éireann on the withdrawal of the developers Stanley Holdings from a deal with Dublin City Council for the development of a 9.3 hectare site for a town square and associated housing in Belmayne, Dublin 13, which will have a massively negative impact on local residents and the newly established north fringe urban district; and if he will make a statement on the matter; (5) Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh — the need for the Department of Education and Science to immediately allow the works promised for St Brigid's girls national school, Palmerstown, Dublin 20, to be carried out; (6) Deputy Seymour Crawford — to urge the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE to withdraw any proposals to wind down or close Monaghan General Hospital while they have totally failed to provide as good or better services which they publicly guaranteed; (7) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — the need for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to intervene directly to require the Health Service Executive not to proceed with its plan to remove, by the end of November, all acute medical services from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital, the consequences of which will undoubtedly entail great inconvenience, unnecessary suffering and in some cases the avoidable deaths of patients; (8) Deputy Olivia Mitchell — the impact of the withdrawal from Protestant fee-paying schools of the support services grant, the unilateral breaking of the formal agreement between former Minister Donogh O'Malley and Church of Ireland bishops representing all Protestant faith based schools, the effective deprivation of Protestant faith children from receiving an education within the ethos chose by their parents given that the number of such schools in the State is limited to 21 schools in just 13 counties and that for a paltry saving the Minister has arbitrarily ended the long-standing acceptance of the necessity to facilitate Protestant ethos education for disadvantaged children of that faith; (9) Deputy James Reilly — the closure of Hedgestown national school, Lusk, north County Dublin, caused by a health and safety notifiable incident, namely, a collapsed asbestos roof and ceiling and the continuing danger to 82 primary school children from asbestos and a school which is unfit for purpose, and to raise the urgent need for new replacement school under the rapid development programme; and (10) Deputy Lucinda Creighton — the recommendation of the Dublin and cities electoral area boundary committee that Sandymount village be divided between two separate electoral areas, which fails to take into account sections 2 and 3 of the terms of reference of the committee as established by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The matters raised by Deputies Crawford, Ó Caoláin, Tuffy, Mitchell and Reilly have been selected for discussion.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I wonder where is the Minister for Health and Children.  Is there anyone from the Department of Health and Children in the Chamber who cares about the health of the people of Monaghan?  Today, meetings are taking place between management and staff regarding further winding down of services at Monaghan General Hospital.  Some 48 nurses, 42 non-clinical staff, 22 administration staff and 18 support staff are to be redeployed.  Most doctors will be redeployed or will go and the hospital, where €14 million has been spent in the past few years, will be restructured into a rehabilitation centre.  Two thirds of the services and staff are being removed.In the past week we have seen the anger of ordinary people at the treatment of over 70s by this Government.  The Minister for Health and Children and the Fianna Fáil-led Government has done a partial U-turn regarding the medical card for most but not all.  Is it fair that these will be the group of people to suffer most from the proposed withdrawal of Monaghan General Hospital from the public service?  That the service will no longer be available in Monaghan and that they must pay transfer costs to Cavan or Drogheda means that people will delay going for treatment where possible, until it is much more serious and may even lead to death.  At this late stage, I beg the Minister to ignore more highly paid experts from London and listen to the consultants and staff at Monaghan General Hospital.  Can the Minister of State advise me as to the difference between the elderly and the sick in County Roscommon who voted for the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and the families who voted in County Monaghan?  Are the taxpayers of County Roscommon more important than those of County Monaghan?Is it not time that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, or some senior person on her behalf, looked at the excellent refurbishment work that has been carried out, not only on the two active wards in Monaghan General Hospital but also at the one that was recently closed?  In the accident and emergency room patients are dealt with more quickly than in most others in Ireland and there is also the partially used state-of-the-art theatre.I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his colleagues have apologised openly in the Dáil to the elderly people of Ireland for their ill-informed actions regarding medical cards.  I have been told that some Ministers actually had tears in their eyes.  They should remember the 17 patients who died when Monaghan General Hospital was off-call before.  I beg the Minister of State, his ministerial colleagues and his colleagues in Government to end the stupidity of closing down Monaghan General Hospital while there is no alternative.  They would avoid having the deaths of future patients on their hands if not on their consciences.I have the document in my hand that we were given only a few minutes ago.  That is the courtesy we, as Members of the Oireachtas, were afforded.

The HSE has confirmed that the final removal of all acute medical services from this hospital will take place in late January or early February 2009.  In other words, the HSE has confirmed the death sentence for Monaghan General Hospital.  A hospital which has provided care to generations of people will be no more.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, her Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government, the HSE and above all, the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members for Cavan-Monaghan should hang their heads in shame.  They have betrayed the people and have allowed vital services to be taken away with grave consequences for the health and the very lives of the people of County Monaghan.  This will be a devastating blow to the people of that county and will be a major reduction in overall hospital services in the entire north-east region.  It is the culmination of years of attrition by the Government and the HSE during which time service after service was taken from the hospital.  The HSE has stated that once a medical assessment unit opens in Cavan General Hospital in late November or early December, the transfer of acute medical services from Monaghan to Cavan will happen within two months.There are currently 3,000 acute medical admissions to Monaghan General Hospital per annum.  If the HSE plan goes ahead, by the beginning of February 2009 this service must be provided by Cavan General Hospital where not one single additional acute hospital bed will be provided.  The plan outlined to staff today by the HSE makes no mention of the location of additional accident and emergency ambulance cover in Monaghan town, as promised by the HSE.  In a letter to me of 3 September, the HSE lists measures that must be in place prior to the centralisation of acute inpatient services at Cavan General Hospital.  These included an additional 24-hour emergency ambulance at a Monaghan ambulance station, an increase of one, or 50%, from two to three ambulances.  When I learned from sources within the HSE that the promised extra ambulance service may not be located in Monaghan town the HSE failed to deny this and confirmed that other locations were being considered.Our hospital is to be closed and we do not even have a guarantee that we will be provided with the ambulance service which the HSE stated was vital.  The removal of services from Monaghan General Hospital has already caused the deaths of patients.  I have no doubt that the closure of the hospital will lead to considerable inconvenience, totally unnecessary suffering and, in some cases, the avoidable deaths of patients.On the floor of this Chamber today I accuse the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, the Fianna Fáil Deputies, Rory O'Hanlon and Margaret Conlon, and Senators Diarmuid Wilson and Francis O'Brien of betraying the people of counties Monaghan and Cavan whom they were elected to represent.  Thanks to these Fianna Fáil time servers who failed to confront their Government on a life and death issue, health care in County Monaghan is to be devastated while Cavan General Hospital will be forced to cope with a considerable additional workload of patients without the additional resources required.However late in the day it may be, I call on these people and on all others with positions of influence, to contact the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, the HSE and the local Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members and local authority representatives, not only in counties Cavan and Monaghan but throughout the region in a last minute 11th hour appeal.  It is not too late to get a conscience about this issue.

The report also identified a significant future role for all five hospital sites in the provision of acute hospital services.The report has helped to inform the approach being adopted by the HSE to the implementation of its transformation programme.

In particular, it is necessary to establish a medical assessment unit at Cavan to help manage an anticipated increase in activity arising from the transfer of acute care services.  Enhancements in pre-hospital care in the Cavan-Monaghan area are also required, including the development of an enhanced ambulance and pre-hospital thrombolysis service.  Beyond that it will be important to ensure that existing capacity is used more efficiently and this has been highlighted in the national bed utilisation capacity report prepared for the HSE.

This will be in addition to day surgery, outpatient and minor injury services.I understand that senior HSE management are today briefing staff at Monaghan General Hospital along with the union and staff representative bodies on these intended changes.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	651	St. Brigid's national school for girls in Palmerstown, Dublin 20, featured in news reports recently because it was not included on the list of schools building projects announced by the Minister of Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, several weeks ago, despite an assurance being given by a Minister that the project would be included on the list.  It is almost ten years since the school authorities applied to have the school modernised and upgraded.St. Brigid's national school is housed in an old building constructed in the 1950s.  Since the construction of a flat-roof extension in the 1970s, no further substantial works have taken place in the school.  The original application for works was made in 1999 and the proposed project proceeded to design stage in 2000.  A design team estimated the project would be completed in May 2003.  New plans were submitted in 2005 on foot of a request by the Department made in 2004.  The authorities were informed at that point that the plans would be assessed as a priority project.  In 2006, the Department wrote to the school authorities indicating that the project was long overdue and badly needed.  Although the site was ready for construction in 2007, the project did not feature on the most recent list of school building projects announced a couple of weeks ago.Students at the school must contend with an old fashioned, inadequate heating system which broke down in March last year.  As a result of this breakdown, one of the teachers spent Monday mornings mopping the floors, affixing gas cylinders to heaters and telephoning a plumber to beg that he repair the boiler.  In addition, teachers were unable to cook or heat foods at lunchtime because electrical sockets would blow due to increased demand.  The school also had to hire expensive gas heaters at a cost of €700 because it could no longer heat the school.A sum of €750,000 has been spent on consultation fees and moving prefabricated buildings from one site to another as part of the project.  The prefabricated buildings on the site cost the Department €10,000 per month to rent.  Clearly, putting the project on the long finger does not make economic sense.Teachers and students must avoid water dripping from ceilings and run from prefabricated buildings to the main building between classes.  As running water is not available in classrooms, water must be brought into classrooms in buckets if it is required under the curriculum.  Health and safety issues arise for teachers and pupils.  The buildings have mould, mildew and dry rot and make for a poor learning environment.  The cost of heating the prefabs is substantial and the school is too cold in winter and too warm in summer.  In addition, there are insufficient classrooms.St. Brigid's is an excellent school and community facility.  The teachers and pupils, who try their best in the circumstances, have been fighting for the refurbishment project for years.  Having been promised the project would proceed before the 2002 and 2007 elections, they have learned that it is still on the long finger.  In this day and age, it makes no sense to place pupils and teachers in conditions akin to those described by Dickens.  The alleged objective of the Government is to have more sustainable public buildings to address climate change.  The school buildings in St. Brigid's national school are inefficient and wasteful of energy because the Department has refused to invest the money required for the refurbishment project.  The project should be a Government priority.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the proposed building project for St. Brigid's national school, Palmerstown, Dublin 20.St. Brigid's national school is a fully vertical, all-girls school, which means it caters for pupils from junior infants to sixth class, inclusive.  It has a current enrolment of 399 pupils.  Enrolment at the school has decreased by 12% over the past five years.  The school has a staffing level of a principal, 15 mainstream teachers and five special education teachers.  The board of management of the school has applied to the Department for large-scale capital funding for an extension and refurbishment project.  The brief for the proposed project is to upgrade and extend the existing accommodation.  The upgrade will include the replacement of all windows, flat roof remediation and mechanical and electrical worksThe additional accommodation being provided will comprise 739 sq. m., which will include the provision of general classrooms and enhanced staff facilities.  The proposed project is at stage six of the architectural planning process, which is tender action stage.  The tender report was submitted to the Department in November 2007.As the Minister has indicated in the House many times, the Department must prioritise how it spends its capital funding to ensure it is first targeted at areas and schools most in need.  To enable this, each application is assessed against published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were formulated following consultation with the education partners.  Under the criteria, each application, once assessed to determine the level and type of need presenting, is assigned a band rating.  Projects are progressed from the initial design stages through to tender and construction commensurate with the band rating assigned to them and as funding is available.The project for St. Brigid's national school has been assigned a band 2 rating, the second highest band rating possible.  Higher band 1 rated projects address accommodation needs in rapidly developing areas where either no accommodation exists or the existing accommodation is not sufficient to meet the needs of a growing population.  It also addresses the provision of accommodation for special needs pupils, structurally unsound buildings and the provision of accommodation to underpin rationalisations.Given the extent of the demand on the Department's capital budget for projects in these categories, it is not possible for the Department to give an indicative timeframe as to when the project for St. Brigid's national school can be approved to proceed further.  The Department's capital allocation for next year will amount to more than €581 million which will allow it to continue to invest significantly in school buildings throughout the country, provide additional school places, refurbish existing schools and invest in higher education infrastructure.The Deputy will appreciate that it is only possible to meet all the school accommodation needs incrementally and over time and that an orderly and structured manner is critical to ensuring the most urgent needs are met first.  This is ensured by the implementation of the prioritisation criteria which the Minister has outlined.The Minister assures the Deputy that the progression of the project for St. Brigid's national school will be considered in this context and as the necessary funding becomes available.  Again, I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and outline the current position.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	653	I tried this morning to have the Dáil adjourned to have this matter discussed.  While it was not agreed to do so, I appreciate the opportunity to raise it on the Adjournment.  The budget measure cutting school services grants has the most serious implications not only for the children it will affect directly but for virtually all Protestant faith schools, some of which may have to close, and, more seriously, for the future of the Protestant community.  I do not exaggerate in making that statement.The support services grant withdrawn by the current Government was the direct result of a formal agreement between the former Minister for Education, Mr. Donogh O'Malley, and Church of Ireland bishops representing all Protestant faith schools.  The agreement was made prior to the introduction of free education in the 1960s.  This special grant was in recognition of the fact that the State could not provide appropriate education to Protestant faith children because such children were few in number and the Protestant community was dispersed.  Existing schools needed to be boarding schools for the same reasons and could not participate in the free education scheme introduced by the then Minister.  Until the most recent budget, this agreement had been honoured by successive Governments through the decades.The agreement copper-fastened an understanding, dating back to the foundation of the State, that the new State would always respect and facilitate the education of the minority Protestant communities.  For the Minister to refer to this agreement now as a mere anomaly is hurtful and insulting and does not reflect the provenance of the agreement nor the ongoing need for it.The Minister may be of the view that this grant is somehow a subsidy to the children of the former landed gentry.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The sum involved is small — a mere €2.8 million annually — and is administered by the secondary education committee on behalf of all Protestant faith schools.  It is used exclusively to allow disadvantaged children attend a school with an ethos appropriate to their faith.  As the majority of Protestant faith schools are fee-paying, in effect the grant is used to provide a subsidy to families unable to pay the higher fees inevitably associated with small schools and boarding schools.  Most of them are boarding schools.The implications of losing the grant are clear.  Disadvantaged children will not be able to attend the school of their parents' choice and these schools will, in many cases, simply become untenable and ultimately have to close, with all the consequences that has for the long tradition of Protestantism on this island.  Many of these schools have been in existence for hundreds of years.  I am sure the Minister, although he is now in China, does not want to go down in history as the one who closed them.Protestant faith schools are facing all of the same cuts as other schools as a result of the budget.  On top of this they are being further penalised by the unilateral, arbitrary and utterly ill-conceived withdrawal of this longstanding grant.  Given the history of our island and the recognition of that history and tradition as regards how schools and education have been funded and delivered since the foundation of the State, this move is high handed, insulting and does not reflect the wishes of either the majority or the minority.I cannot believe the Minister, in referring to this grant as an "anomaly", had been briefed on either its provenance or purpose.  I believe it might have been foisted on him by a Department in search of easy targets to cut.  However, he now knows its history and I ask that this cut be reversed immediately.  At €2.8 million it is really a paltry sum in the context of the overall budget and certainly the saving does not justify the offence and damage this will cause to the minority community.

For that reason, the Minister was surprised by the comments attributed to the Archbishop of Dublin concerning the agreement referred to by the Deputy.  In addition to the block grant, Protestant fee-paying schools were paid a range of support services grants that the Catholic fee-paying schools did not receive.  These grants were not available at the time of the agreement with the representatives of the Protestant faith schools and therefore the Minister is not breaking any formal agreement.  The purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from the Protestant fee-paying schools in 2009.There are 56 fee-charging second level schools in the State, of which 21 are Protestant, two inter-denominational, one Jewish, and the balance of 32 are Catholic.  The Deputy has expressed concern regarding the effect the withdrawal of the support services grant will have on access by disadvantaged students of the Protestant faith to schools reflecting the Protestant ethos.  The Minister wishes to re-emphasise that there are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant.  Protestant fee-paying schools receive, and will continue to receive, the Protestant block grant, which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.The grant is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority, which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.  The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance the Minister for Education, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.The decision to remove these grants came against the backdrop of a difficult international economic situation.  It was inevitable in these circumstances that the education budget for 2009 should include a number of measures that will involve curtailing expenditure.  However, the Minister cannot agree with the Deputy's assertion that their removal will affect access by disadvantaged Protestant students to fee-paying schools, as this access remains protected through the Protestant block grant.Once again I want to thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to speak on this Adjournment Debate and the Minister of State for coming in to discuss it.  As the father of young children, he will appreciate the seriousness of this matter.The school at Hedgestown in Lusk, north County Dublin, was built in the 1940s and extended in the 1960s.  These buildings are what might be described as "pre-fab" in type, although they are not prefabricated.  They are unfit for any purpose at this stage and have been acknowledged as such by the Department of Education and Science which promised a new school in February this year, as the school board accepted.  Nonetheless, no works have taken place.  This is all the more difficult to understand given that the school had purchased a site across the road and was making it available to the Department.I shall now turn to the gravity of the situation.  This school has an asbestos roof.  Below the roof is a suspended ceiling with what is commonly referred to as rock wool, for insulation.  The tiles on the school floor are also asbestos, as are the drains and the pipes.  What happened here was extremely frightening for children and staff.  The roof collapsed over half the classroom, between the students and the only door that acts as an exit.  It was by the grace of God that no one was seriously injured.  The children had great difficulty in getting out of the classroom, as did the teachers, following the collapse of the roof.I visited the school, met the principal and saw the state of the room.  It was just extraordinary.  One must remember these are primary school children, aged eight to ten, who were terrified.  Looking around the room, one saw the suspended ceiling falling all over the place and rock wool interspersed with rodent faeces.  Thankfully, the school has been closed and arrangements have been made to move the students to Educate Together in Lusk.  It is extraordinary, however, that  it is now planned to re-roof and re-tile the existing school at enormous cost to the taxpayer when a new school was promised and the site is available.  Surely the Minister of State must admit it makes more sense to build the new school now with pre-modular units that could be onsite and commissioned in six months.Furthermore, the Department has given a grant of only €50,000 to carry out the repairs, whereas at a minimum it will cost €120,000 as well as architects' fees — and that is being conservative.  Since the roof is asbestos, they are now monitoring the asbestos levels in the air and clearly all children have been removed from the school.  These works will take five to six weeks to complete and in the meantime children will have to be transported to the new school.  However, agreement must be reached on a location from which they will be collected and I hope we will get co-operation and that the Department will provide the necessary insurance for any carpark that might be used for this purpose.The new facility is to be an eight-classroom school, but surely as an interim measure a four-classroom school could be built, with a PE room in phase 1, and phase 2 being built thereafter.  There are 92 children enrolled at the moment, most of whom are out of the school.  Certainly, some of the classes have gone and cannot return.  The entire school is closed and children cannot be collected from there because of the asbestos problem, which has yet to be clarified.  Some 92 children will be enrolled next year, 104 the year after and 106 the following year.This is a growing area, as alluded to by the Minister of State in one of his earlier responses.  There is very little sense, in my view, in expending further taxpayers' money on a time-expired building built partly in the 1940s and partly in the 1960s, when within four months and for a little extra money a new school could be put in place.  I understand these modular units are merely leased from the providers and therefore would not represent huge capital outlay.I hope the Minister of State can reassure the children, parents and teachers of Hedgestown school, which caters for many pupils from all around north County Dublin, including Balrothery, Lusk, Rush, Naul, Man-o'-War, Walshestown and Balbriggan, that a new school can be provided.  Otherwise what we are facing is disruption for the students while they are being transported over and back to Educate Together in Lusk, only to move back into this unsatisfactory situation and have to move again later.  It seems to be waste of the State's resources as well as the children's and parents' time.I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell the House that, rather than having this interim measure, these children having been subjected to the shock of the roof falling in on them, will be facilitated, put to the top of the queue and given priority for their new school.  This should take place as expeditiously as possible so that they can move straight from Educate Together back to a new school.Having spoken to some of the parents today, my understanding is that if the Department acts other than expeditiously, there could be other consequences, perhaps of litigious nature, which I would find regrettable.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take the Adjournment and I look forward to his response.

This means that it caters for boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class, inclusive.  The enrolment as at 30 September 2008 was 82 pupils.  The school has a current staffing of a teaching principal, three mainstream class teachers, one language support teacher and one learning support teacher.The existing school building is currently located on a sloped site of less than 0.5 acres.  The school has three permanent classrooms and the Department is grant-aiding the rental of a prefabricated mainstream classroom and resource rooms.  The Department also sanctioned the purchase of a prefab this year to meet the school's September 2008 needs.A ceiling collapse in the school was reported to the Department last week. The Department immediately notified the incident to the Health and Safety Authority and it advised the school to do likewise.  A senior member of the Department's professional staff visited the school to assess the situation and to make recommendations on the works that would be needed to address the problem.  A member of the Health and Safety Authority also visited the school.Following the recommendations of the Department's professional and technical staff, the board of management was informed that the Department will provide the school with the funds to carry out the necessary remediation works and to employ a suitably qualified consultant to advise the board of management on and to oversee these works.I am pleased to inform Deputy Reilly that alternative accommodation has been sourced for the entire school population pending the completion of the works.  This accommodation is in Rush-Lusk Educate Together national school.  The Department provided an off-site construction building for this school earlier this year and accommodation is available in it on a short term basis.  Transport to this accommodation is in the process of being arranged for the Hedgestown pupils.  They are expected to take up occupation when the schools re-open after the mid-term break.The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, wants to take the opportunity to thank the authorities and the principal's of both Hedgestown national school and Rush-Lusk Educate Together for their co-operation in what is a difficult time for Hedgestown national school, in particular.With regard to the proposed large scale capital project for Hedgestown, the Department intends providing the school with a new eight classroom generic repeat design building.  A site for this development is being provided by the parish.  It has been technically assessed and deemed suitable.  The project for the new building was announced by the former Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to progress to architectural planning in April 2007.In common with all applications for large scale capital funding, the application for Hedgestown was assessed in accordance with the Department's published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  It has been assigned a band two rating under this process.

The Department will also continue to consider the advancement of the large scale large scale building project for the school under the school modernisation and building programme.Once again I thank Deputy Reilly for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	659	As provided for in the Waste Management Acts the relevant local authorities have the responsibility both for making statutory waste management plans and regulating the activities of persons engaged in the collection of household waste. Furthermore, the statutory responsibility for collecting or arranging for the collection of household waste is vested in local authorities by virtue of section 33 of the Act. As provided for in section 60(3) of the Act I, as Minister, am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by a local authority of a statutory function given to it under the Act.The position in Dublin has involved the four Dublin local authorities making an amendment to the regional waste management plan for which they are responsible. My Department is aware that Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the region, is using the powers available to it to review waste collection permits that it has previously issued.  This occurs in a context in which private service providers have taken a significant and growing share of the Dublin household waste collection market with obvious implications for the local authorities in terms of meeting the costs of the various waste management services which they provide and the operation of a waiver scheme for low income households. Also, Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council has announced that it is considering its intention to withdraw from waste collection services by means of direct labour and to outsource this service on behalf of its customers.I recognise that the existing regulatory framework requires modernization. Significant regulatory issues have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years, including through the rapid growth in, and consolidation of, the private waste management sector. These issues, which have been the subject of a formal public consultation, include the dual role of local authorities as regulators and service providers, the need to ensure that waste services are provided in a manner consistent with the achievement of national and EU environmental objectives and targets, and that any necessary public service criteria apply in relation to the provision of services in particular areas or in respect of specific households regardless of whether the service is provided by the public or private sector.  This matter is currently subject to proceedings in the High Court and in that regard it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.My Department is monitoring the emerging position in the context of the views articulated during the public consultation and any necessary legislative or policy responses will be brought forward.

In summary, Directive 2004/38 is concerned with the rights of citizens of the EU and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States.  The referral to the ECJ was particularly focused on a condition included in the 2006 Regulations which required non-EEA spouses of EU nationals seeking to avail of the Directive's provisions in relation to free movement, to demonstrate that they had prior legal residence in another Member State.The ECJ ruled that the Directive's provisions must be interpreted as applying to non-EEA spouses of EU citizens, irrespective of when or where their marriage took place, and regardless of how the non-EEA spouse may have entered the host State.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has since made Regulations to respond to the ECJ ruling.  The European Communities (Free Movement of Persons)(Amendment) Regulations 2008 amend the 2006 Regulations by removing the provision which the ECJ found to be incompatible with the Directive.  My Department is now considering the implications, if any, of these Regulations insofar as access to housing supports is concerned, and will issue further guidance to local authorities, as necessary, as soon as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	661	At both public consultation stages of the Monaghan County Development Plan 2007-2013, which was adopted in March 2007, my Department expressed serious concerns that the draft plan did not support the objectives of the National Spatial Strategy, the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Border Region or the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning AuthoritiesThe Council's draft plan did not adequately identify areas under strong urban pressure, particularly in those parts of the County close to the main towns of Monaghan, Carrickmacross and Castleblayney and along the N2 National Primary Route.  This ran counter to the approach set out in the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines published in April 2005.  These Guidelines apply to all planning authorities and are aimed at striking a balance between providing a sustainable planning framework for rural housing and making it easier for those who are part of, or have links to, local rural communities to build a house.  The Guidelines provide that reasonable planning proposals on suitable sites in rural areas for persons who are part of, contribute to, or have links with the rural community should be accommodated.  They thus affirm a presumption in favour of quality one-off housing for rural communities, provided that proposals meet appropriate standards in relation to matters such as proper wastewater disposal and road safety.  The Guidelines also classify rural areas for housing purposes, and specifically address those locations, such as Clár areas, suffering from de-population.The rural planning policies proposed in the Monaghan County Development Plan 2007-2013 were without any objective assessment of housing needs, and could have facilitated inappropriate development of one-off houses in rural areas under significant urban pressure without the provision of sufficient essential infrastructure services.  The Council has amended the County Development Plan to take account of the Ministerial Direction which I issued on 23 July 2007 under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to address this issue, and I have no plans to re-examine my Direction to the Council in this regard.I am conscious of the local implications of a Ministerial Direction and, consequently, I highlight, where necessary, issues and concerns of a strategic and serious nature at the early stages through my statutory consultative role.  It is a matter for Monaghan County Council, in the first instance, to ensure that its County Development Plan, and any variations to the Plan, provide for the proper planning and sustainable development of its area, supported by proper assessment of the scope and extent of rural housing needs.

This represents a reduction of 4% on the record provision for 2008, which, it should be noted, was an increase of 16% on the 2007 estimate.   By any measure, the 2009 funding is very significant — representing an average of over €4.5m per day in 2009 — and it is a clear signal of the continued priority attached by the Government to housing in general.In line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, the significant proportion of the overall housing budget which is to be devoted to social housing programmes will be reduced by no more than 1.7%.  In the circumstances, this is a good outcome, particularly when account is taken of the fact that we have relieved some of the pressure on the programme in 2009 by securing an additional €80m of investment, this year, under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme for voluntary housing projects.Of course, in the context of a difficult economic transition, we must seek to maximise the return on public investment, as measured by the extent to which we are meeting housing needs.   One option which my Department will be pursuing with local authorities over the coming months will be the use of long term lease arrangements for social housing purposes to supplement traditional local authority construction or acquisition. I believe that this would provide a more cost effective, targeted approach, in line with the principles of the life-cycle approach endorsed by the social partners.We have made considerable progress in recent years on our social housing programmes and I am confident that the financial provision for housing for 2009 will enable us to maintain strong momentum towards meeting our commitments in Towards 2016 and our longer-term goals under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.

However, the Exchequer allocation of almost €35 million to the EPA for 2009, which represents an increase of 25% on 2007 levels, underlines the importance of the work that the Agency carries out and my commitment to strengthening its role, particularly in the critical areas of environmental enforcement and compliance.

In carrying out their work, the Committees undertook public consultation which involved inviting submissions by way of notices in national and local newspapers; a dedicated website; and writing to members of the Dáil and Seanad, local authorities and the local authority associations.  Submissions received by the committees can be viewed at www.electoralareacommittees.ie.When publishing the reports on 17 June 2008, I announced that, consistent with long established practice in respect of constituency formation at European, national and local levels in Ireland, I was accepting the recommendations contained in them.  It is my view that to review or seek to amend the recommendations of the committees at this stage would undermine the independent and apolitical nature of the process. I will be making the necessary orders to give effect to the recommendations in the reports as soon as possible.

Suitable arrangements for implementation of the levy will be determined by my Department in that context.With regard to sustainable travel patterns, my Department actively encourages staff to use means of transport, other than cars, wherever possible.  To this end, the Department is a partner in the One Small Step campaign being overseen by the Dublin Transportation Office.  A Workplace Travel Plan, which aims to encourage greater use of sustainable transport options in travelling to and from work and in the conduct of official business, has recently been developed in the Department.  Through implementation of the Plan, a range of initiatives to encourage use of sustainable travel options amongst Departmental staff will continue to be put in place.  A travel survey, conducted in September 2007 as part of the One Small Step campaign, demonstrated that the number of Departmental staff driving to work is remarkably low (18%), especially compared to the GDA regional peak period average of approx 60% (DTO).Arrangements regarding implementation of the car parking levy for agencies under the aegis of the Department will be an operational matter for the agencies concerned.

The forecast figures used in the Carbon Budget last week reflect those contained in the report Ireland's National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections to 2020 issued by the Agency on 25 September 2008.  However, as indicated in the Emissions Table which I presented with the Carbon Budget, the methodologies for calculation of sinks are still evolving and these numbers may require adjustment before finalisation for 2008-2012.The principle of carbon sinks and the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is established in the Kyoto Protocol.  According to Article 2 of the Protocol, the protection and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and the promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation are among the policies the Parties may implement to meet their respective commitments.  The rules of the Protocol allow Parties to include sequestration from net afforestation since 1990, that is sequestration from the planting of new forest since 1990, less the effects of deforestation over the same period.

The launch of the revised suite of grant schemes in November 2007 and the associated publicity has led to a heightened level of demand across all local authority areas.In light of this, local authorities have been requested to operate the grant schemes on a prioritised basis, with particular consideration to be given to applicants requiring adaptations to facilitate discharge from hospital, or to alleviate the need for hospitalisation in the future, and those applicants requiring improvement works to facilitate the continuance of care in their own home.To take account of particularly significant levels of activity experienced by a number of local authorities, supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling €3.6 million were made in September 2008. Details of a further round of supplementary Exchequer allocations to other local authorities, to the value of €5 million, are currently being finalised.In addition, and in line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, the total financial provision secured for housing in 2009 will allow for the level of funding allocated towards housing supports for older people and people with a disability next year to be increased by 8% over the initial estimate for 2008.

Test results will be assessed against baseline data from the previous survey.Furthermore, at the request of local residents and public representatives, the current ongoing site assessment works, and the 2005 report, are being peer reviewed by independent experts to offer reassurance to the local communities that the scope of works, tests and analyses employed conform to best international practice in determining whether the site poses any immediate health or environmental threat.  Professor Phillip Morgan (Sirius Geotechnical & Environmental Ltd.) and Dr. Marcus Trett (Physalia Limited, Consultant & Forensic Ecologists) have been appointed to carry out the peer review.Both the White Young Green and the peer review reports will be published once they have been received and assessed by my Department. Any recommendations arising from these reports will then inform proposals to Government. The future use of the site will determine the level of any future remediation that may be required and any potential costs involved.I anticipate that both the White Young Green and peer review reports will be available in a matter of weeks.

In February 2008 a procurement process was initiated to appoint consultants to undertake comprehensive research on the waste sector in Ireland and to cover a wide range of issues to help identify how best to proceed with further efforts to reduce waste levels, improve recycling rates and deliver equitable and cost-effective waste management solutions.This study, the scope of which also includes issues such as how best to promote alternative technologies such as mechanical and biological treatment processes, will underpin the overall review as provided for in the Programme for Government. The procurement process has been completed and Eunomia Research and Consulting Ltd. (and partners) have been retained to undertake the study. Extensive consultation with key stakeholders is envisaged and I anticipate that the study will be completed by mid-2009.

Those currently in receipt of social housing support include tenants of a local authority, voluntary/co-operative tenants and those being housed under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.It is envisaged that the incremental purchase scheme will be applied initially to houses and its extension to apartments will be dependent on a framework for the sale of local authority apartments being included in the above legislation.Subject to the broad terms of the scheme set out in the Bill it is intended that the range of purchase prices required to be provided by the purchaser will be between 40% and 60% of the full cost of the dwelling.  Similarly the mortgage periods will vary according to the percentage of the purchase price payable relative to the household's income, but it is envisaged that mortgages will be for between 20 and 30 years.It is not intended that a separate income threshold would be set for eligibility outside of that used to determine the household's eligibility for social housing support generally.  Instead, the ability to purchase through the scheme will be based on the household's ability to afford the mortgage.  On that basis, assuming, for example, a 40% stake in a dwelling is bought, it is expected that households with an income of €20,000 to €30,000 would be able to participate.In relation to mortgages for the scheme, the legislative framework allows for both local authorities and private lending institutions to provide mortgage finance to prospective buyers.  In general, where a private lending institution has provided mortgage finance to a purchaser, that mortgage has precedence over other charges on the property.  The local authority charge would normally rank next in precedence.  The Bill allows that, with the permission of the local authority, a purchaser can remortgage or refinance their property.  If this occurs, the Bill provides that the local authority can, in specific circumstances which include refinancing/remortgaging, agree that any such refinancing/remortgaging charge will have priority where it would not normally have done so.

In this regard, the Government announced the provision of €270 million for the purchase of units, in addition to €20 million provided in my Department's Vote in 2006.  The ultimate cost to the Exchequer will depend on the final purchasing requirement and the price of the units at the time of purchasing. Independent consultants have assessed the average price in the period at €15 per unit, and the cost of purchasing up to 18 million units for Kyoto Protocol compliance purposes is therefore estimated at €270 million.The amount to be paid each year is not predetermined and, in general, payments will be made as purchasing transactions are completed.  Following enactment of the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency is statutorily designated as purchasing agent for acquisition of carbon units.  Costs incurred by the Agency in purchasing carbon units will be managed in accordance with the provisions of the 2007 Act.Prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent, my Department invested €20 million in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and committed a further €10 million each to the Carbon Fund for Europe and the BioCarbon Fund operated by the World Bank.  Management of these investments is a matter for my Department and, since enactment of the 2007 Act, payments are made through the Carbon Fund process as they arise.

The National Programme on Transboundary Pollutants, which the Government approved in 2005 and updated in 2007, provides for the progressive reduction of these emissions by 2010 through a range of policies and measures in different sectors.  These include:improved effectiveness of pollution abatement technologies in road vehicles, as a result of the progressive reduction of the sulphur content of both petrol and diesels;emission reductions in the power generation sector arising from implementation of the 2001 Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC), transposed in Ireland by the Large Combustion Plant Regulations 2003;replacement of old, high emitting oil-fired power plants with new state-of-the-art plants; andongoing implementation of integrated pollution and prevention control licensing for existing industrial plants.In addition to the range of policies and measures in the Programme, further progress towards meeting the 2010 ceilings is being achieved through measures that have subsequently been announced.  These include:the promotion of greater energy efficiency and the recent increase in the target for electricity generated from renewable sources;ongoing improvement in the environmental performance of road vehicles, due to the adoption of more-stringent EURO standards for motor cars and vans,revisions to motor tax and VRT with effect from July 2008, coupled with the existing VRT relief, will provide a greater incentive for consumers to choose fuel-efficient and lower-emissions vehicles, andgreater efficiency of road usage through the Government investment in the Transport 21 programme.Further reductions in emissions from the transport sector are expected.  The Consultation Paper on Sustainable Travel and Transport, issued by the Minister for Transport in February 2008, fully recognised the problem of polluting emissions, as well as CO2, from motorised vehicles and the role that modal shift and a reduction in congestion levels could play in abatement of such emissions.  I understand that it is the intention of the Minister for Transport to publish a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan before the end of this year.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.I welcome the recent report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to The Future of the Electoral Register in Ireland and Related Matters. The report is consistent with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to establish an Electoral Commission, with responsibilities to include compiling a new national rolling electoral register.My Department has appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  This work is now well-advanced and I expect to receive the report in the coming weeks.  The research conclusions will inform further consideration of the approach to be taken in relation to establishment of the Commission.

This required each planning authority to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 in accordance with the policy guidance, the main principles of which are as follows:Certain core facilities/infrastructure to be taken in charge on request — public roads and footpaths, unallocated surface parking areas, public lighting, public water supply, foul and storm water drainage and public open spaces;The matter of taking in charge will be addressed at pre-planning application stage and in the planning application the developer will be asked clearly to identify the area to be taken in charge;Planning authorities will take all necessary measures to ensure proper completion of the development, in particular through securing adequate bonds, inspection of construction and the taking of enforcement action when necessary;The procedures for taking in charge will begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.  Protocols, including time frames, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge;n relation to older estates, priority must continue to be given to resolving those estates that have been left unfinished or not taken in charge for the longest period.A new local government service indicator in relation to the taking in charge of estates has been introduced, which will provide benchmark data from 2009 onwards for monitoring the taking in charge process.  The information to be reported will include: the number of estates that were taken in charge in the year in question; the total number of dwellings in these estates; and the number of estates in respect of which enforcement action was taken.I will keep the issue of taking in charge under review and I will be informed in this regard by the information provided by local authorities for the service indicators report; the report for 2008 will be available in the middle of 2009.

Development contribution schemes are drawn up by each planning authority and approved by the elected members following a public consultation process.  It is a matter for the members of the planning authority to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.My Department has no role in forecasting the annual development contributions income across planning authorities.  As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each planning authority.Details of individual development contribution schemes are available directly from each planning authority. Each planning authority is also required to include details of contributions received and contributions owing to it, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual report of the authority.My Department's Annual Planning Statistics for 2001-2006, which gives an unaudited breakdown of Development Contribution income for Local Authorities, are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie. The 2007 Annual Planning Statistics are currently being finalised and I expect to make them available on my Department's website shortly.

The current variable interest rate to local authority borrowers, excluding mortgage protection, is 5.25%. The current fixed interest rate available on local authority loans, excluding mortgage protection, is 5.5% for a period of 5 years.These rates compare favourably with the corresponding rates charged by commercial lending agencies and are generally adjusted in line with movements in European Central Bank (ECB) rates, following consideration by the Board of the HFA.

As indicated in the Plan, allocations at installation level are made on the basis of historic rather than current or future emissions.  The Plan, which was prepared by the Agency, has been approved by the European Commission and is not open to adjustment.The potential savings from the introduction of the proposed energy efficiency and performance standard for light bulbs are based on emissions attributable to lighting in the residential sector.  This initiative will assist the power generating companies in reducing the cost of compliance with their greenhouse gas emission caps in the 2008-2012 commitment period and will also, of course, result in a net decrease in total national emissions.

Prior to any assessment being carried out my Department issues guidance to housing authorities, in the form of a circular, to ensure a consistent assessment approach.

A copy of the relevant circular (N21/07) has been placed in the Oireachtas Library for information.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 53, 213 and 214 together.The Programme for Government contains a range of commitments in respect of waste management policy centred on the Government's continued support for the internationally recognised waste hierarchy which places major emphasis on the prevention, reuse and recycling of waste while minimising reliance on landfill and incineration.  This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill.  Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.  The Programme also signalled a move away from mass burn incineration towards alternative technologies.This is a process which will be assisted by the major review of waste policy, also provided for in the Programme, which has now commenced and which will address how better to implement waste prevention and minimisation in the particular context of the emergence of new technologies for waste management, particularly those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste which can reduce the need for both incineration and landfill.Undue emphasis on incineration as the cornerstone of waste management policy is detrimental to the development of alternative solutions.  The review may well indicate a continuing role for incineration in our future waste management strategy but I do not envisage it being on anything like the scale that was previously envisaged.On completion of this major review in 2009 I will bring forward any necessary legislative and policy initiatives needed to give effect to its conclusions.At present there are no municipal waste incinerators in Ireland and my Department has no function in determining the number, type, location or capacity of any such facilities that may be constructed.  Such projects would be advanced by private sector service providers or by local authorities, generally by way of a public private partnership.  It is a matter for the promoters of such projects to seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals i.e. planning permission and a waste licence.  In carrying out their functions planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, and the EPA in regard to waste licensing, act independently of the Minister.  The approved capacity of individual facilities is a matter for determination through these processes, as provided for in the Planning and Development and Waste Management Acts.My Department continues to provide grants to local authorities towards the capital development of facilities such as bring banks, civic amenity sites, composting and material recovery facilities.  In 2008, over €22 million has already been provided in grant assistance for such facilities.  This funding has been primarily provided from the Environment Fund.  The previous capital grant scheme for waste recycling infrastructure closed to new applications on 30 June 2008 but in recognition of the continuing need to promote the development of recycling infrastructure I established a new grants scheme — the Waste Recycling Capital Grants Scheme — in July 2008.  This scheme will ensure that grants continue to be available to local authorities for the future development of recycling infrastructure.  My Department will also continue to provide a subvention to local authorities to assist them in meeting the operational costs associated with the running of their recycling facilities.

It sets out environmental priorities with a particular focus on four areas: climate change, nature and biodiversity, health and the quality of life, and natural resources and waste.The mid-term review of the 6th EAP in 2007, which is available on the website of the European Commission at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/newprg/review.htm, was discussed at the June 2007 Environment Council.  That Review assessed progress made and identified the outstanding challenges to be addressed.My Department continues to advance the protection of our environment to ensure compliance with EU standards across the four priority areas and to address issues raised in the Review both at national level and through participation in EU and international fora.

Under this new arrangement the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the affordable purchaser's perspective.  However, instead of units being sold at a discounted price, with the value of the discount being subject to a reducing clawback, the State will take an equity stake in affordable units sold.  The purchaser will have the option of either buying out the remaining equity in steps or at the end of a fixed period.Initially, I intend to apply the equity loan arrangement to affordable housing delivered under Part V of the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative, once the details have been finalised and the necessary legislative provision has been introduced through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2008.  The issue of introducing an open market component of the scheme will be kept under review in light of developments in the housing market.These new arrangements will introduce greater equity into the system and provide a basis for achieving greater consistency across the schemes and across different areas of the country.  The greater protection of the State's investment will also mean that funds can be recycled into assisting further households with affordable housing.Full information on the revised arrangements will be made available prior to their commencement.  In the interim, the existing arrangements for allocation and sale of affordable housing continue to apply.  Prospective applicants for affordable homes should apply in the normal way to the local authority or local authorities in the areas in which they are interested in purchasing.  The website www.affordablehome.ie also carries information on affordable housing, and many local authorities are using this facility to advertise affordable homes, including application forms, in addition to their own local advertising and ongoing contacts with applicants on their lists.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	690	Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this.  In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider.  Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator.Significant regulatory issues have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years.  These issues, which have been the subject of a formal public consultation, include the need to ensure that necessary public service criteria in relation to the provision of services in particular areas or in respect of specific households are properly reflected.  The existing regulatory framework requires modernisation.  The identification of the changes necessary will be greatly assisted by the recent OECD report on the review of the public service, which includes a specific case study on waste management.  This week's report by the Ombudsman on Waste Waiver Schemes Administered by Local Authorities is also relevant in this regard and I will be giving the report, and in particular the recommendations contained within it, my fullest consideration.It is also the case that the revised approach to the collection of household waste being taken by the Dublin local authorities will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste collection services, whether delivered by the private or public sectors.  In these contexts the appropriate policy responses will be developed and elaborated to address the concerns raised.

The concession represents an extension of time only and applies solely to 2008.  All landspreading activity will still be conditional on weather and ground conditions being suitable as set out in the Good Agricultural Practice Regulations.  My Department has formally communicated the taking of this measure to the European Commission.Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of slurry as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters.  In no part of the Country would good agricultural practice involve slurry spreading in November or December.

The strategy builds on the strong progress made under previous strategies and sets out a vision to address adult homelessness over the next five years.It was developed under the aegis of a Cross Departmental Team, which comprises representatives from the relevant Government Departments and agencies and in consultation with the National Homeless Consultative Committee, which includes representatives from homeless service providers, both statutory and voluntary.The strategy sets outs a range of actions under each of its six strategic aims, together with implementation targets and timescales for the most significant actions.  These will form the basis of a more detailed implementation plan being developed under the aegis of the Cross Departmental Team on Homelessness, which will assign lead roles and specific timelines with emphasis on the need to maximise efficiency, value for money and organisational and financial streamlining.  Work on the implementation plan is under way and submissions have been requested from organisations represented on the Cross Departmental Team and on the National Homeless Consultative Committee.  I expect the Implementation Plan to be finalised by end 2008.

The marketing of individual areas, including Kildare, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development and, in line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland is focused on delivering investments to all of the Gateway and Hub locations.  In the case of County Kildare, IDA's strategy is to promote the whole county as part of an integrated East Region.  In addition, the Agency continues to work with its existing client base in an effort to get them to grow and expand their existing operations.At present there are 25 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kildare employing 10,356 people.In the present competitive global market, as Ireland competes for new investments at the highest end of the value chain, the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue being successful in realising a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the NSS is constructed. Future thinking and action must have a regional rather than a local bias and this requires a significant change in mindset.As regards IDA land in Kildare, I must reiterate that the management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas and it is not a matter in which the Minister of the day has any involvement.  It should be noted that IDA Ireland provides property solutions not only to its own clients but to client companies of Enterprise Ireland, who are entitled to establish in IDA owned lands and buildings.I am informed by IDA Ireland that, at present, the Agency has lands in Monasterevin, Athy and in Castledermot.  I understand that the Board of IDA approved the sale of all these lands to Kildare County Council at its Board meeting on April 9th 2003.  However, this transaction was never finalised due to a failure in negotiations.  IDA informs me that it is currently reviewing the future use of these lands.  As part of this review, the Agency has again written to Kildare County Council to determine the Council's interest in the acquisition of these lands.The use to which IDA property can be put is prescribed by legislation and the disposal of property for any alternative use requires the consent of the Minister of the day.  However, the Agency is always available to discuss proposals regarding availability or suitability of individual properties with Local Authorities, Enterprise Boards or Community Groups and I will be happy to consider any request for such consent should it be required.  However, in this context, it must be remembered the Agency must seek to maximise the financial return to the Exchequer in disposing of such property.I understand from Enterprise Ireland that a total of 11 people, representing five companies based in Co. Kildare, are participating in the current trade mission to China.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	696	I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 to 66, inclusive, together.The range and make up of supports and services provided by FAS at local level is a day-to-day operational matter for FÁS.I understand that in early 2008 FÁS in completing its annual review of the Jobs Club programme raised concerns about the capacity of the Carrick-on-Suir Jobs Club to meet the agreed targets.  Representatives were advised by FÁS that if there was no progress towards achieving the targets funding would be discontinued.I understand from FÁS that the relevant contracts do not indicate that participants for the formal training course would be provided by way of direct referral from FÁS.FÁS will continue to run the current suite of programmes in Carrick-on-Suir, i.e. three Community Employment (CE) Projects with 62 places, a Job Initiative programme, with 5 places and the Local Employment Service. In addition FÁS has announced a Core Employment Skills programme which will start in Carrick-on-Suir in November.FÁS is committed to supporting those in Carrick on Suir who are unemployed and has initiated discussions with other community interests in the town to determine what alternative programmes would attract potential participants and address the needs of unemployed people.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	697	The Enterprise Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, together with the local County Enterprise Board, are responsible for promoting indigenous enterprise and attracting foreign direct investment to the area.  The bodies are actively involved in addressing industrial development in South Tipperary in conjunction with the local County Development Board.I am aware that the County Manager in South Tipperary has set up a working group to deal with unemployment issues in the area.  Local groups have been set up in towns in order to prepare a development plan.  Enterprise Ireland will be attending the next meeting of the working group which is scheduled for early next month. The working group meets on a regular basis and reports to the Development agencies periodically.  This group has been assured that Enterprise Ireland will be available when and where the group feels it is appropriate.The Tipperary South County Enterprise Board is continuing to support enterprise development in Carrick-on-Suir through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance and is ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.In the context of promoting foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland works closely with the educational institutions in the region to ensure that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to South Tipperary are being developed.  The agency's strategy for South Tipperary, which has been agreed with South Tipperary County Council, is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel in the first instance, and to develop the town as a first-class location for overseas investment. In this regard, Carrick-on-Suir is very well located to capitalize on its position between Clonmel and Waterford.  The agency also works with the Industrial Training agency FÁS to ensure that the needs of industry in the areas of training and up-skilling are being met.  Indeed, the full services of FÁS are available to any workers who wish to avail of the agency's services.I am satisfied that the structures that are currently in place in South Tipperary will continue to address economic development and job creation both in Carrick-on-Suir and South Tipperary in general.

Incremental increases are not therefore individually costed and there is no separate provision for incremental increases in my Department's estimates in either 2008 or 2009.The estimated cost of incremental pay increases awarded to existing staff in the agencies under the remit of my Department in 2008 and 2009, is a day to day matter for the agencies concerned.  My Department has no role or function in this process.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	700	On the basis of my Department's 2008 Estimates provision, the cost of the 2.5% pay increase payable from 1 September 2008 is estimated at €464,000 gross in 2008, or €1.392 million gross on a full year basis for my Department and its offices.While no specific additional provision has been included in my Department's 2009 Estimate for the payment of the 3.5% pay increase which would become payable from 1 September 2009 under the terms of the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement, the cost of the increase is estimated at €644,000 gross in 2009, or €1.933 million gross on a full year basis for my Department and its offices.  My Department will be expected to meet the cost of the increase in 2009 from within its Estimates allocation for next year.The application of pay increases to agencies under the aegis of my Department is subject to a formal approval process by my Department.  The implementation of the pay increases, once approved, is matter for the agencies concerned.  On the basis of the 2008 Estimates provision, the cost of the 2.5% pay increase payable from 1 September 2008 for the agencies under my Department's remit is estimated at €2.626 million gross in 2008, or €7.879 million gross on a full year basis.On the basis of the 2009 Estimates provision, the cost of the increase which would become payable from 1 September 2009 in respect of the agencies is estimated at €3.653 million gross in 2009, or €10.959 million gross on a full year basis.  Again, no specific additional provision has been included in my Department's 2009 Estimate for the payment of this increase and the agencies will be expected to meet the cost of the increase in 2009 from within their Estimates allocation.The figures provided above include the cost of certain pensions paid by my Department and its agencies.

This reduced limit will apply for 2009. The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits, to determine the value of pension contributions on which an individual taxpayer will get tax relief at his/her marginal income tax rate in any year.The reduction in the annual earnings cap to €150,000 next year will result in a significant fall in the maximum value of tax relief that high earners can obtain on contributions to private pension provision. This change was made to promote greater equity in this area.

This means that excise on petrol in Ireland is still substantially lower than the EU 15 average and excise on diesel is also below the EU 15 average. It should also be noted that the excise rates on both fuels are below the rates of our main trading partners, in particular the UK rate where excise on petrol and diesel is around 63 cent per litre.I have no plans to reduce the excise rates on either of these fuels.

It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of Auto Diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.The figures provided for VAT receipts for 2008 are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of oil products up to the end of August. Mineral Oil Tax is paid in the month of clearance of the product but, depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid.

Recommended procedures for the implementation of this provision are set out in Guidance Notes issued under the aegis of the Money Laundering Steering Committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives of financial services industry bodies, the regulatory authorities and State Agencies, including the Garda Siochana.Paragraph 59 of the Guidance Notes for Credit Institutions provides that in the case of accounts to be opened for clubs and societies the identities of at least two elected officials and of two signatories on the account should be established in accordance with the guidelines set out in paragraph 45.  Paragraph 45 of the Guidance Notes details the various methods which may be used to verify name and address. In the case of address verification a current utility bill is one of a number of options available to a financial institution. The other options include checking the Electoral Register, making a credit reference agency search, checking a local telephone directory or available street directory, checking notice of Determination for Tax Credit, Current Balancing Statement from Revenue Commissioners, Social Insurance documents, Current Household/Motor Insurance Documents and Revenue Commissioners C2 Tax Certificate.Normally difficulties of the type mentioned by the Deputy are resolved by an approach from the customer to the branch management or to the bank's customer service department.

It also specifies that the regulated entity must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears and the Financial Regulator's CEO has pointed out that the Financial Regulator considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with a borrower where it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen. (For details see www.financialregulator.ie.)In keeping with the principles of the Irish Banking Federation's (IBF) Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears, member institutions of both the IBF and the Irish Mortgage Council ensure that the question of repossession does not arise until every reasonable effort has been made to find an alternative.  We have been informed by the IBF that home repossession in Ireland is, generally, a last resort for the lender.  The Code includes provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty and represents a framework within which these lenders agree to operate.  The lenders agree under the Code to adopt flexible procedures for the handling of arrears cases, to assist the borrower as far as possible in his / her particular circumstances and recognise in full the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.In the light of all of the above I am satisfied that adequate safeguards are in place to address the issues raised by the Deputy.

The Minister intends to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible with a view to implementing the scheme in 2009.Budget 2009 provided €55 million for the implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme next year. This brings the total funding in the subhead for long-term residential care to €909 million. The Department is carefully considering the implementation of the scheme within the context of that allocation.With regard to the funding for contract beds and enhanced subvention, operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004. The Department is advised by the HSE that it is currently working to distribute the funding.The HSE further advise that all private nursing home providers have been written to and advised of the revised arrangements and individual files are being reviewed at Local Health Office level. The calculations are quite substantial in respect of these individual cases and work will continue between now and the end of the year to make the necessary payments with appropriate arrears being paid where appropriate. Nursing Homes Ireland have also been advised of the position.The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People has not yet been finalised. This will highlight the resources required and will have to be considered in drafting regulations.Under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services for inspecting and registering all residential centres for older people, including private nursing homes.  Once this part of the 2007 Act is commenced, he or she will inspect centres against the regulations governing these centres and standards set by HIQA.  The overall resources that will be made available to HIQA in 2009 is dependant on the outcome of the budget and estimates process for next year, which is not yet finalised.Finally, individuals who qualify for certain therapies while being cared for in the community continue to qualify if they enter long-term residential care.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	725	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services. In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	727	Tackling all Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA and C. difficile,continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE). HCAIs are not a new phenomenon and have always been a potential complication of medical treatment, especially in hospitals.  This is the case worldwide. The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  The HSE aims over the period of the Plan to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  A new National Surveillance System has been established to collect data and provide information on HCAIs in our health system.  This data covers four key areas:1. Staphylococcus bacteraemia (bloodstream infection);2. Antibiotic consumption;3. Alcohol gel use; and4. From 2008 onwards, MRSA Surveillance in Intensive Care Units.Data in respect of the first three areas has been compiled and published for 2006 and 2007. This report provides essential data that will serve as a benchmark for assessing progress in the future.  I firmly believe that you cannot manage what you do not measure. With this system we have now begun a very useful measurement process.  The results so far show some improvement in 2007 over 2006.  The overall S. Aureus bloodstream infection rate was lower in 2007 (0.36) compared to 2006 (0.37).  The overall proportion of MRSA was also lower in 2007 (38.5%) compared to 2006 (42.4%).It would not be feasible to screen all patients for MRSA on admission to hospital.  Where appropriate, selected screening to detect colonisation is carried out on certain groups of patients including those known to be previously positive, patients with non intact skin and those due to undergo elective high-risk surgery.  Some specialist hospitals e.g. orthopaedic hospitals operate a full pre-operative testing regime.  The data collected for the MRSA surveillance system relates to bloodstream infections.  However, the data collected in ICUs covers all infections including bone and wound infections.  Since May 4th of this year, C. difficile has become a notifiable disease and all cases now have to be reported to the relevant Department of Public Health. The range identified in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections in acute hospitals in 2006 was 0.5% of patients studied. The information available to date shows that the incidence now is consistent with the results of the 2006 survey.Screening is also undertaken for a range of other viruses and bacteria where indicated and these include Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, TB etc.While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally by the application of strict infection prevention and control practices and precautions.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	733	The Health Act, 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others). Entitlement to a medical card is determined mainly by reference to means, with provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of ‘undue hardship' where the income guidelines are exceeded, while individuals in the second category are required to pay for certain services.  Medical card holders are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.  Determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.   Individuals with medical cards residing in nursing homes have the same eligibility to services as those in the community. I believe that the availability of services such as of physiotherapy, chiropody, dental care and occupational therapy should not be dependent on where the individual is residing.

The Dublin II Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003), is intended to prevent the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another Regulation State and has entered that other State before entering Ireland and making an asylum application here. At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.The person in question was requested to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 19 August 2008. She failed to present herself and is now recorded as having evaded her Transfer Order. This person is currently being sought by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. She should make herself known to them without further delay so that arrangements can be made for her transfer to the United Kingdom.  As stated in the reply to Question  No. 205 of 10 April 2008, this person was transferred to the United Kingdom under the Dublin II Regulation on one previous occasion on 16 April 2007 but has since then illegally returned to this State.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in August 2007. I understand that applications received in January 2007 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.Officials in the Citizenship Division of my Department have informed me that no application for citizenship exists with regard to the person referred to by the Deputy.

This is based on the principle that the overall cost of increments for staff on incremental scales should be offset by reductions in costs arising from the retirement or other movements of staff at higher salary points and their replacement by staff at lower salary points.  Therefore there is no separate provision for incremental pay increases in my Department's Estimates for 2008 or 2009.

The opportunity to address this work, which is provided by the closure of the Museum, will be fully utilised.The National Museum intends to display some of the Natural History collection in the Riding School, Collins Barracks from the end of January 2009.  The primary purpose of the Riding school exhibition is to provide an alternative public display for a portion of the Natural History Museum exhibits, while the building remains closed for redevelopment. The style of the exhibition is intended to reflect the familiar vintage exhibition, using popular exhibits and using some furnishings relocated from the Natural History Museum. The theme of the exhibition is two fold, based on the subtitle ‘Past and Present', which reflects the history and future plans for the museum, and also the past populations of animals in Ireland since the Ice Age and the changing face of the Irish fauna through habitat loss and climate change.  In addition to animals familiar from the Natural History Museum, the exhibition will include some fossils, minerals and rocks from the National Museum's geological collections.The Natural History Museum is a much-loved Institution and my Department, the Office of Public Works and the National Museum are examining options for early commencement of the restoration works so that it will be re-opened as soon as possible.

Of this, over €5,000 was drawn down in 2003 for initial architectural fees. As the Deputy may be aware, the facility is linked to the broader regeneration of the particular area in Dublin 7.Following the decision by the developers earlier this year to withdraw from the regeneration project, Dublin City Council officials are currently working on alternative ways to progress the redevelopment.  I understand that they hope to be in a position to present proposals on how to proceed at a public meeting before the end of the year.  Consequently, the draw-down of the remaining funding under the YPFSF will need to be examined in the context of these proposals.In relation to the Fund, it should be noted that arrangements to give effect to its transfer to the Office of the Minister of Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) — in line with the Taoiseach's announcement last May — are expected to be completed shortly. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the development of the facility in question will be a matter for the OMCYA to consider in the context of funding available to them for 2009.

The original loan application, supporting documentation and records of repayments may also be examined in order to assess the capacity of the person to make a long-term commitment to repayment of the loan in question.  It is a matter for the community welfare officer to a make a decision on entitlement once s/he is satisfied that all the facts of the case have been established.The Executive has advised that it has not received all of the documentation it requested in this case.  It further advises that it has not received sufficient documentation to allow a decision to be made in this case.  A decision on entitlement to mortgage interest supplement will be made when all documentation requested has been received.

The Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the acquisition and maintenance of office accommodation for the Department. The Department together with the OPW and South Dublin County Council is exploring the possibility of having a Local Office in Adamstown as part of the planned new Civic Centre.Jobseeker claims for people living in the Lucan area are administered by the Social Welfare Local Office in Clondalkin.  Signing-on for the majority of jobseekers occurs once in any 4-week period.  However, to avoid the necessity for people in Lucan to travel to Clondalkin, they sign-on at a Signing Centre in Lucan village.Heretofore the signing Centre in Lucan was open on 2 days a month from 9.30 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2.00 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.  However with the increasing numbers claiming a jobseeker's payments, this has been increased to 3 days a month.  Local management in Clondalkin is keeping the matter under review.

These have been received and his case has been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral appeal hearing.During 2007 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to 14.4 weeks.In 2008, to the end of September, the Social Welfare Appeals Office has received almost 14,000 appeals, an increase of 22% in respect of the same period in the last few years. Every effort is made to treat these appeals in a fair and equitable manner and within this context to have the appeal dealt with as quickly as possible. Improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office. However, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on Social Welfare entitlements.

The legal right to undertake employment and be self supporting are considered by the deciding officer when the person's centre of interest and future intentions are being examined.In order for Romanian nationals to work in Ireland, they are required to have a work permit; neither the person referred to nor her partner, both of whom are Romanian nationals, appear to have such a permit. Both the person referred to and her partner appear to have been in Ireland prior to Romania's accession to the EU in January 2007 but did not register with the Dept of Justice or have work permits for this period.The person referred to, first made an application for Child Benefit in August 2007. This  application was refused on 14th September 2007 as the Deciding Officer, having considered all the circumstances, did not consider that the person concerned satisfied the HR condition as her centre of interest and future intentions had not been clearly established due to her inability to work legally in Ireland, or alternatively to support herself independently.The person concerned was notified of the decision in writing on 14th September 2007 and given the right of appeal.A further Child Benefit application was received from the person concerned on 5th August 2008. This application has been refused as the Deciding Officer does not consider, after having all examined the circumstances, that the person concerned yet satisfied the HR condition as her centre of interest and future intentions have not been clearly established due to her inability to work legally in Ireland, or alternatively to support herself independently.The person concerned was notified of the decision in writing on 7th October 2008 and of her right to appeal the decision.

I understand the majority of these, both in 2007 and 2008, were accommodated in local authority housing, with the remainder accommodated in voluntary housing. Housing authorities are responsible for accommodation and related services for homeless persons. I am not in a position to comment on the support needs of individuals.  However, there are a range of support services such as tenancy sustainment and settlement services available, as appropriate. It is a matter for the housing authority to determine the supports, if any, required in each case.

A study of the future requirements of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) undertaken by Dublin City Council has projected, on the lines of current usage levels, that the GDA will require an extra 300 million litres of water per day by 2031 and identifies the River Shannon as one possible source in that context. I understand that Dublin City Council initiated a Strategic Environmental Assessment in relation to the study findings in 2006 and that extensive stakeholder and public consultation processes are underway in which it is open to all interested parties to participate.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the process at this stage, or to anticipate the likely outcome.

The administration of the schemes, including the detailed appraisal of new applications, the management of the planning and procurement stages of projects and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority. The Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) provides funding of up to 100% of the approved cost of accommodation for the elderly, the homeless and persons with special housing needs including those with an intellectual or physical disability. Within my Department's overall housing budget for 2009, the budget for the Capital Assistance Scheme will be maintained at its 2008 level of €130 million.As is to be expected with a multi-annual capital investment programme, proposals for funding under the CAS are currently at various stages, including preliminary project appraisal, procurement of consultants, detailed planning/design and procurement of the capital works contracts. There are currently some 44 projects awaiting funding approval under the CAS. The overall value of these projects, which are expected to provide some 380 units of accommodation when completed, is estimated at €70 million, with some €24.5 million of this estimated to relate to Part V projects. Having regard to the existing level of commitments, the increased delivery under Part V and the substantial number of schemes being advanced through planning and design stages, I will now be considering the scope to approve further projects in 2009 in light of the funding available.

Over recent months, voluntary and co-operative housing bodies have benefited greatly from the increased delivery of social housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in most local authority areas, particularly in the Greater Dublin Area. Given that the majority of Part V units are more generally suited to family-type accommodation, those which are being assigned to the voluntary and co-operative housing sector are, for the most part, funded under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).  Having regard to the fact that the substantial number of approved projects funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) and the CLSS contain both Part V units and units provided under conventional contracts, some of which may extend over a twenty-four month period, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the percentage of the overall allocation that Part V projects will account for in 2008, or to estimate the likely percentage in future years. However, it is estimated that some 70% of the housing units being advanced under the CLSS at present, and approximately one-third of those being advanced under the CAS, are Part V-related.

It is consequently a matter for individual authorities to determine the level of emergency accommodation to be provided, having regard to the need for such accommodation within their areas.The number of persons and households living in accommodation that is designated as emergency fluctuates from time to time due to the demand-led nature of emergency accommodation.  Under section 9 of the Housing Act 1988, local authorities are required to carry out an assessment of the overall need for social housing on a triennial basis.  The most recent assessment took place in March 2008 and results, including those in relation to homelessness, will be finalised and published as soon as possible.

The loan term will be up to 30 years.  A minimum income of €40,000 will be required and a detailed credit policy is now being finalised.  A single standard variable interest rate product, related to the prevailing rates available from commercial institutions will be applicable.  All applications will be rigorously assessed having regard to an applicant's ability to pay, credit history and all other aspects of the formal lending policy.  An applicant's ability to pay will also be stress-tested to assess their ability to repay at current rates and in the event of significant interest rate rises.No new formal institutional structures are being established for the purpose of administering the scheme.  Four local authorities will be designated as lending authorities acting on a regional basis.  The four designated local authorities are Cork City Council, Dublin City Council, Galway County Council and Kilkenny County Council.The four designated local authorities will be supported by a Central Processing Unit, staffed by appropriately skilled personnel, including qualified underwriters, and operated with administrative assistance from the Affordable Homes Partnership.  The Central Processing Unit will handle enquiries, process all Home Choice Loan applications from all local authority areas, and issue a determination to designated local authorities on each application in accordance with a formalised credit policy.  The Unit will also carry out credit checks, with access to Irish Credit Bureau data.It is envisaged that applications will be accepted from early November.  Prospective purchasers can register their interest at this stage on the www.homechoiceloan.ie website or through the dedicated lo-call number and they will be contacted with further information in relation to the application process.The scheme applies to new houses because a significant majority of first time buyers purchase new houses.  The average new house price is almost 14% lower than the average second hand house price, so it was considered appropriate to target the scheme towards properties which are more affordable for First Time Buyers.

The schemes included in the Programme are derived mainly from the assessments of needs undertaken by all local authorities, including Kildare County Council, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting water services infrastructural requirements.  In these assessments, authorities are required to quantify the needs for capital works in their areas and to list their proposals on the basis of the priorities adopted by the elected members.Prioritised work programmes submitted by county councils inform the annual block grant allocations by my Department to local authorities under the devolved Rural Water Programme.  Kildare County Council has been notified by my Department of a block grant allocation of €1.887 million under the 2008 Rural Water Programme, of which €1.087 million is in respect of group water and sewerage schemes.  A record provision of €560 million — an increase of 19% over 2008 — has been made available for water services investments in 2009.

In this, I am taking into account the detailed work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.Given the scale of investment in the system to date, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential that the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  It is not possible for me to make more specific comment at this point pending completion of the necessary work and a decision by Government in the matter.  In these circumstances, the question of formal offers in respect of purchase of the machines does not arise.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.In working to compile the Register for 2007/8, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades. On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years. The task now for local authorities, in relation to the Register for 2009/10, is to maintain and build on the progress made to date.Local authorities are required to publish the Draft Register on 1 November 2008 and people have until 25 November to check it to ensure that their details are present and correct. My Department will run an advertising campaign to encourage people to check that they are on the Draft Register and to notify their city or county council of any errors or omissions before 25 November.Looking to the future, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register. My Department has appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  This work is now well advanced and I expect to receive the report in the coming weeks.  The research conclusions will inform further consideration of the approach to be taken in progressing the Government commitment.

The Council announced in June 2008 that the 2009 European Parliament elections will take place between 4 and 7 June 2009.Each member state must fix a polling date within this period and a polling day order will be made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under section 10 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 at the appropriate stage.  Although a formal decision has not been made in the matter, I expect that, as on previous occasions, polling at the European Parliament and local elections will take place on the same day in June 2009.

The Scheme, which amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the scheme of Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme (SHAE), is designed to provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.  The types of works allowable under the Housing Aid for Older People scheme are varied but may include central heating works.The Scheme facilitates the implementation of a Government Decision, taken in February 2006, to transfer the SHAE from the Health Service Executive to my Department.  That decision arose on foot of a recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report that a more integrated service and better value for money may be achieved by transferring responsibility for the SHAE Scheme to the local authorities, who already had responsibility for the Essential Repairs and Disabled Persons Grant Schemes. The SHAE has been discontinued with effect from 1 August 2008.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	837	I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 232 together.Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource rests with the regional fisheries boards, in this instance the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  I am advised by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board that glass eels are not commercially fished or sold to third parties in the Shannon Estuary.   Since 2000, the Board has managed the operation of the Shannon estuary glass eel fishery in partnership with the ESB Fisheries Conservation Division, which purchases the catch for the purpose of stocking above Ardnacrusha Hydro Dam.I am advised that prior to 2000, ESB Fisheries Conservation carried out experimental glass eel fishing on the Bunratty River, Rine River and River Maigue at a cost of €31,000 in 1997, €25,000 in 1998 and €21,000 in 1999.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	838	Migratory species such as Atlantic salmon and European Eel are affected by hydroelectric generation.  Prior to the collapse of previously healthy salmon stocks following an outbreak of the Ulcerative Dermal Necrosis disease in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I am advised that there were tens of thousands of adult salmon migrating through both the Shannon and Erne stations, decades after the construction of the hydro schemes.There are a series of combined factors that can negatively affect salmon survival including the reduction and degradation of habitat with the advent of the arterial drainage scheme, pollution, afforestation, intensive farming, overfishing and the more recent sharp decline in marine survival. There are many initiatives under way which seek to address these impacts but I understand that it may take many years for improvements to occur.Obstacles to migration in river systems are one of the several factors causing the decline in the eel population. Silver eel escapement at hydropower stations is seen as critical in the attainment of the recovery of the stock. I understand the ESB, in conjunction with the National University of Ireland, Galway, are currently engaged in telemetry studies of migrating silver eel and plan to test the use of hydro acoustic technology for deflecting downstream migrating silver eel into the bypass channel on the River Shannon.  The ESB currently reduces such mortality on the Shannon by means of "trap and transport" operations whereby eels are captured for release downstream of Ardnacrusha dam.   I am informed that the extension of this practice to other hydro schemes, particularly the Erne system, is being considered as part of the process of developing our national and river basin district Eel Management Plans, an obligation under Council Regulation EC No.1100/2007, establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	840	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.I am advised that the European eel constitutes one shared panmictic stock, found all over Europe, northern Africa and the Mediterranean parts of Asia. In past decades, fishing yield and recruitment (i.e. juvenile eels) has gradually declined. Recruitment across Europe has dropped to between 1% and 10% of that observed during the 1970s.It is not correct to state that the French eel fishery has remained stable. French landings reported to the FAO have dropped from 2,687t in 1986 to 415t in 2001.  Similarly glass eels catch by commercial fishermen has dropped from 1,700t in 1978/79 to 80t in 2004/05.  The main decline in French glass eel landings occurred between 1981 and 1985 and they are currently relatively stable although at a very low level.FAO statistics for Ireland suggest that 400t (including an estimate for undeclared/illegal catch) was caught per annum between 1995 and 1998.  In 1999 it was 250t and the annual declared catch since 2001 has averaged 101t per annum.I understand that this decline is consistent with the European trend and in addition may be influenced by the inclusion of undeclared catch estimates in the historic figures. Declining catch, with little evidence of changing effort, is likely to be caused by the falling recruitment and declining local stocks.  Fishing pressure, legal or illegal, hydropower mortality and environmental pressure on habitats across Europe are thought to have contributed to this decline.  I am informed that it is unlikely that illegal fishing on its own could have caused this decline although this is hard to quantify.Given the shared nature of the stock, the challenge is to improve recruitment, upon which recovery of the stock is heavily dependent.  Recently the European Community has taken up the challenge to design a sustainable management system across the various Member States by adopting a regulation for the recovery of the stock. This regulation requires all Member States to prepare Eel Management Plans for the recovery of stocks to be submitted to the Commission for approval by 31 December 2008.The preparation of our national and river basin district Eel Management Plans has been overseen by an Eel Management Working Group which is chaired by my Department. The Working Group comprises representatives of my Department, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, Marine Institute, BIM, ESB and NUI, Galway. Among other issues, the Eel Management Plans are considering actions to address the impact of the undeclared and illegal fishery.A public consultation process was also held over August/ September of this year. Some 16 submissions were received. The views received during the consultation process will be taken into account when the management plans are being finalised. Eel fishermen representatives are due to attend the next meeting of the Eel Management Working Group.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	841	As a consequence of Council Regulation EC No.1100/2007 establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel, it is inevitable that the commercial harvest of eels will have to be curtailed from 2009 onwards.  I will consider the detail of the issues which arise from that situation in the context of the finalisation of the Eel Management Plans, which must be submitted to the EU Commission by year-end.  There has been full public consultation in relation to these plans recently.I have no funds at my disposal for a financial package for commercial eel fishermen.  It should be noted that this is a public fishery and eel fishing licences are issued annually in accordance with by-laws made under section 9 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, as amended, and there is no automatic entitlement to them.  They cannot be transferred, traded or sold.  No property right exists in them.  It is illegal to fish for eel without such a licence.

Specifically, the following sections have been commenced- 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.The National Council for Special Education was required under the Act to make a report on the implementation of the Act.  This report is essentially advice to the Minister for Education and Science on the measures the Council considered necessary to implement EPSEN.  The NCSE report identified a requirement for incremental additional investment over a period of 4 years of up to €235 million per annum across the education and health sectors.My Department, having completed its examination of the NCSE report and engaged in consultations with the Education Partners, identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN. Among the key areas identified for attention were assessment of need, preparation of Individual Education Plans (IEPs), training, and psychological and therapy services; areas also highlighted in the NCSE report.  It is not possible to give exact figures regarding cost as the specific amount of money required to support the implementation of EPSEN would depend on the options chosen and the timeframe for implementation of these options.  However, my Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.In light of the scale of these costs it is necessary to defer the implementation of the Act beyond the date originally envisaged.  Services for children with special educational needs will continue to be made available on a non-statutory basis, and resource teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed.  Furthermore, an additional €20 million in funding has been provided in 2009 to strengthen the services available to children with special educational needs/disabilities.  Of this €10m has been provided to the Department of Education and Science part of which will enable the extension of the National Educational Psychological Service to all schools in the country.  The balance of €10m has been allocated to the health sector with a particular focus on enhancing availability of therapies for children.

The costs are as follows 2006- €52.0 million, €64.4 million (including arrears of €7.5 million).  In 2008, the projected cost is €66.9 million.In the 2007 / 2008 school year, 362,923 days substitute cover for teachers at  Primary level were provided.  28.9% of these days related to certified sick leave and 11% related to uncertified sick leave.  In the same school year, 245,399 days substitute cover for teachers at Secondary and community/comprehensive schools were provided.  25.2% of these days related to certified sick leave and 11.3% related to uncertified sick leave.In addition to the cost of substitution the expenditure on the supervision/substitution scheme in the current financial year is 56 million for primary schools and 35 million for Secondary, Community and Comprehensive schools.

Official school business relates to absences of post-primary teachers at sports events, seminars, arts events etc and is essentially a feature at post-primary where a teacher may be absent with one class and not available to take other classes.However, the existing arrangements will continue to apply for the Supervision /Substitution scheme.  Under the terms of the supervision/ substitution scheme individual teachers can receive an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to salary for providing supervision for children during breaks and providing cover for absent colleagues for thirty seven hours annually.  This element is not being suspended and is still available to teachers and their schools.

With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.  The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered.

Furthermore 7 individuals have agreed start dates with the service between now and early January 2009 and an  additional 6 are currently considering offers of employment or undergoing the requisite Garda vetting process.Additionally I was pleased to announce recently, in the context of Budget 2009, an increase in the funding available to NEPS with which it is envisaged that up to 50 further psychologists can be appointed.  Recruitment of these psychologists will begin early in the new-year from the existing panel of qualified personnel, until its depletion, and discussions commence between my Department and the Public Appointments Service in relation to the establishment of a new panel in this regard.

This has been delivered by subject specific support services and administered and delivered through the education centre network.   Throughout this period support services have developed as their remit dictated from an intensive to a maintenance phase of support.September 2008 saw significant changes at primary and post primary level in the delivery of continuing professional development for a number of subject areas.  The History, Geography, Maths, Religious Education and Junior Science support services have entered a maintenance phase of support and a reduced team in each of the areas has been incorporated into the Second Level Support Service.  However, support has increased at post primary level for Gaeilge and also the Project Maths initiative has commenced.At primary level the two largest service providers (Primary Curriculum Support Programme and School Development Planning Service) have amalgamated from September 08.  The Primary Professional Development Service (PPDS) has commenced provision of support to primary schools and will aim to provide a more coherent service.Over the course of the period referred to a number of new initiatives and Government priorities have emerged. My Department has responded with support in the areas of special education, literacy and numeracy, child protection, Irish language, standardised testing, English as an additional language support for immigrant children, delivering equality of opportunity in schools (DEIS),  bullying, social personal and health education (SPHE),  relationship and sexuality education amongst others.The provision for teacher in-service education support is €28.8m, compared with a 2008 estimate of €33.8m.  It is intended to reduce teacher secondments to in-service and, while it will be possible to continue to provide a wide range of services to teachers, the reduced allocation will mean that programmes that are not in an expansionary or prioritised phase will have to be curtailed to a  degree.

As a consequence of current circumstances, it was found necessary to reduce the operating budget of my Department's Regional Office Service (ROS) for 2009 by 26%.The intention is to rationalise and prioritise some services and to seek efficiencies in the operation of the Department's regional office network.  An analysis will be undertaken by my officials in relation to the exact measures to be undertaken.

This is an unprecedented number of new school buildings in any one year and includes 27 schools delivered under the fast track off-site construction programme in rapidly developing areas. In addition, a total of 29 major extension/refurbishment projects at primary level are expected to be completed this year. Also in 2008, the programme has seen the completion of 3 new post-primary schools and is expected to see the completion of 15 major extension/refurbishment projects in existing post-primary schools.In 2007, 12 new primary schools and 25 major extension/refurbishment projects at primary level were completed.  Also in 2007, 4 new post-primary schools and 19 major extension/refurbishment projects at post-primary level were completed.In 2006, 8 new primary schools and 34 major extension/refurbishment projects at primary level were completed.

While acknowledging the progress made since the ICT in Schools Programme was first launched some ten years ago, these Reports set out a substantial agenda to be pursued to fully integrate ICT into teaching and learning in our classrooms.While we face significant challenges in implementing some of the recommendations made in these Reports given the current economic situation, I am committed to investing in this area as resources permit.  As recommended by the Strategy Group, the role of the individual school ICT co-ordinator will be prioritised along with support for school principals. Nationwide seminars on e-Learning for these personnel will be held and handbooks on planning and implementing e-Learning in Schools are in preparation. A professional development course for ICT co-ordinating teachers on the development of e-Learning Plans will also be available.The National Centre for Technology in Education will collaborate with the various school support agencies to integrate ICT into the delivery of all support services. New online and blended ICT professional courses will be offered and ICT will be integrated into all curriculum development activities. My Department will shortly issue a tender for the next round of the Schools' Broadband Programme and the range of services available to schools will be expanded. A free website hosting service will be provided to schools, which will provide a unique ‘.scoilnet.ie' website address to schools. Substantial digital resources are currently being accessed on the web portal Scoilnet and the NCTE will expand and develop further digital content for teaching and learning.

I wish to advise the Deputy that I have no plans to alter these ratios.The Deputy will be aware that my Department's policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system. In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.

Children under 5 years were chosen as a priority for the introduction of the assessment of need process under the Disability Act 2005 because of the importance of intervention early in life which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment.  As the implementation of the Act in relation to children under 5 is a matter for the Health Service Executive, I would advise the Deputy to contact the Local Health Office of the HSE directly regarding the matter raised by him.

There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.  These decisions included an increase in the enrolment bands of the staffing schedule for the allocation of teachers in primary schools from an average of one teacher for 27 pupils to an average of one teacher for 28 pupils.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The Early Retirement Scheme for teachers, which had operated on a pilot basis since 1996/97, has been suspended in all sectors until further notice.  There will be no retirees under the scheme in 2009.  While the Scheme had been under review, the reason for its suspension stems not as a result of that review but  from the current challenging economic climate within which Government expenditure must be prudently managed.The Scheme, which was a voluntary scheme and was introduced with the objective of promoting efficiency and effectiveness in the school system, consisted of 3 Strands.  Strand 1 applied to teachers with not less than 15 years' service who were consistently experiencing professional difficulties in their teaching duties.  Strand 2 applied to teachers whose retirement would provide their schools with an opportunity to enhance the education service provided through facilitating change.  The teachers had to be aged 55 years or more and had to have a minimum of 20 years' service.  Strand 3 applied to teachers who were in posts which were surplus to requirements.The scheme provided for the grant of added years to teachers on retirement provided that total pensionable service did not exceed 35 years in the case of Strand 1 or 2, or 40 years in the case of Strand 3.  Subject to the above limits, a teacher could receive the following added years: Strand 1 — 25% of service (subject to a maximum of 5 years); Strand 2 — up to 2 years; and Strand 3 — 35% of service (subject to a maximum of 7 years).A teacher who retired under Strand 3 could opt, in lieu of added years, for a severance gratuity at the rate of 3 weeks' pay per year of service to age 65, subject to a maximum of 27 weeks' pay.  The Table attached gives details of the number of retirements of Primary, Secondary, Community, Comprehensive and Vocational teachers in the period 2002-2008.Other schemes of retirement before normal pension age are available.  Teachers can avail of voluntary retirement at 55 years of age where a teacher has 35 years' service or cost-neutral early retirement.  A teacher, other than a new entrant appointed after 1 April 2004, who has reached the age of 55 years and has at least 35 years of actual pensionable service, may retire voluntarily.   There is no actuarial reduction in benefits and credit for certain pre-service training is given in order to assist teachers to reach the 35-year threshold for retirement.  Under cost-neutral early retirement, a teacher aged 50 years or over (55 years in the case of new entrants appointed after 1 April 2004) has the option of an immediate cost-neutral early retirement pension and lump sum  on resignation.  The cost-neutral early retirement benefits are actuarially reduced to take account of the early payment of the lump sum and the longer period over which pension would be paid.YearNumbers retiringTotalPrimarySecondary.

The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.Posts allocated on the basis of the staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account. In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.

These decisions included reducing the level of language support teachers from a maximum of 6 extra teachers per school to a maximum of 2 teachers per school — as was the case pre 2007.  This change will take effect in September 2009.However, the budget measures also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.  This will be done on a case by case basis.  The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the Spring and early Summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils that they are enrolling.  The position of the school in question will fall to be considered at that stage along with all other schools making application to the Department.A wide range of materials are available for schools and for English Language Support Teachers, including the Primary School Assessment Kit. This Kit was commissioned by the Department, and issued to schools earlier this summer.  These materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.   A new team within the Primary Professional Development Service is providing training for primary English Language Support Teachers.   This is currently being rolled out across the country through the network of education centres. This training will help to enhance the ability of such teachers to address the English language needs of our newcomer students.

In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.However, I do recognise that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community.  To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes.  Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.My Department's position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use.  Of utmost importance, schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school's insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.

At primary level, the  programme has been developed on the basis of a provision of a minimum timeframe  of at least 1 hour tuition per week.  At second level, all schools are required  to offer Physical Education as part of the curriculum, and the syllabuses have  been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.A curriculum in Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part  of all programmes for primary students and at junior cycle. The programme  begins in the infant classes and specifically addresses the need for regular  exercise, and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced  diet. These themes are continued into the programme in junior cycle under the  physical and mental health modules in the curriculum.Schools also play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of  students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations  such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football  Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to  participate in sport. The Irish Sports Council, in co-operation with bodies  such as the FAI and Local Sports Partnerships, has developed a national Buntús  Primary Schools Initiative through which additional supports — training,  resource cards and equipment — are provided to support teachers and others in  introducing young people to sport, and to complement the Physical Education  curriculum. The initiative aims to raise the profile of physical activity and  sport, improve inservice training opportunities for teachers, assist governing  bodies of sport to develop and deliver appropriate supports for teachers, and  provide enjoyable and meaningful activity for children which supports the  delivery of the curriculum. For practising teachers, curriculum support  services at primary and second level provide training and school based support  for teachers.This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people  to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities.  In a  new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as  part of the design.  Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects  were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by the Department as part of  a record overall investment of €2.6 billion in modernising primary and  post-primary school facilities throughout the country. Many more large-scale  projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near  future. New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as  part of any major building programme.A special PE funding package of €6.5 million issued in 2006 to primary schools,  and in 2007 a similar package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools.  Under these packages, primary schools received €2,000 and post-primary €4,000  towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was  issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment  such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc. Since 2000 the Department has also  provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the  provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to  purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical  education. Such materials and equipment would normally be expected to last for  a number of years.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we  are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed,  the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for  Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical  activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active  for at least 4 hours per week.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my  Department, except in exceptional circumstances.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a  maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the  correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local  authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the  relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not  interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the  position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

There is  nothing exceptional in this. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. At primary level the final allocation to a school  is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide  for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not  available within the agreed terms of the scheme.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their  enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data  although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation processes  including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.I appreciate that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will  impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that the enhanced  levels of funding announced in the Budget for the capitation and ancillary  services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this.   Budget changes  will take effect in 2009.The school book grant has already been made to the school in question for the  current school year. Funding for the equipment grant for the resource teacher  and funding arising from the school's inclusion in previous disadvantage  initiatives, as well as access to the services of a rural coordinator will  proceed as normal in respect of the current school year.The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall  level of funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167  million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009. The Government is committed to  making further improvements as resources permit.

The issues to be considered in the  timing and bundling of these schools include site availability for each school,  geographical spread and the estimated total cost of the proposed school bundle.My Department is examining the feasibility of allowing the school referred to  by the Deputy proceed in the 3rd Bundle of school projects to be procured via  Public Private Partnership. This examination is nearing completion and I will  be making an announcement about the matter as quickly as possible.

The new school will be  called Luttrellstown Community College and the Patron is County Dublin VEC.My Department is working closely with Co. Dublin VEC and is currently examining  the possibility of opening the new school in September 2009 subject to the  identification of suitable accommodation.

Greenfield  provision for this school will be considered in the context of the Department's  on-going multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.
