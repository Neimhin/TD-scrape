We regret the delay.  I must inform its members that we are obliged to adjourn at 1.45 p.m., which gives us approximately 15 minutes.  I draw their attention to the fact that members of the committee have absolute privilege but the same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee which cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it.  Furthermore, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Dr. Kilkelly to commence her submission.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Thank you, Vice Chairman.  I am chairperson of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  With me is Mr. Liam Herrick, a director of the trust which is a non-governmental organisation with a commitment to reducing imprisonment, respecting the rights of everyone in the penal system and progressive reform of the penal system based on evidence-led policies.  We have prepared a short document for the committee.  I understand all members have received a copy.  I will not, therefore, go through it in any detail, given the amount of time we have available, except to identify what we see as key issues in this debate.  This is a monumental point in penal reform and policy and in the development of our criminal justice system generally.  In that context, there is an urgent need for a wide-ranging debate and public consultation on all aspects of the planning and design of the new prison.  Some of these issues are highlighted in our submission.  We must determine the role of the prison in our penal policy and in respect of our attempts to reduce the prison population and protect the rights of all prisoners and those who work in the system.  That is the probably the most important point in our document.I will flag another few points, after which I will take questions.  Key issues arise in regard to capacity and overcrowding.  There is much uncertainty and a lack of public information in respect thereof.  The capacity issue is not so much about numbers in that it is related directly to the possibility of an increase in the prison population.  This would have very significant long-term repercussions for wider criminal justice policy, yet we have not seen any evidence to show a significant expansion of prison capacity is or will be necessary.There is an apparent lack of broader policy on these issues, particularly regarding the use of community sanctions and the ultimate effect on the prison population.  I refer also to the use of detention and the inquiry into that, which should consider the high level of detention on remand and the use of short sentences that have very little rehabilitative effect.  This is a significant single issue but is related to all the questions surrounding penal policy.While the issue of overcrowding and cell design might appear to be an operational matter, it is really the key to what prisons do and how effective they are.  Overcrowding is clearly a problem in the prison system.  It is particularly important to consider the extent to which it presents a substantial obstacle to effective prison management, to having safe prisons and to ensuring a constructive regime.  We are anxious that there be a clear policy commitment to single occupancy of prison cells in the new prison but also, critically, that there be a discussion on and explanation of how cell design and prison design generally will conform to international standards and best practice.  There needs to be a clear sense of how the prison can be designed to ensure maximum compliance with international obligations and best practice.Other issues of concern arise regarding the new prison.  These include the remote nature of the site, its size and the risk it may pose to security and the regime.  We have specific concerns over the use of the prison for the detention of children, the replacement of the Dóchas centre, the use of the prison for the detention of immigrants and the collocation of the Central Mental Hospital with the prison.  These issues are identified in our document and I do not propose to elaborate on them.My final point concerns accountability in the prison system and the need for public discussion and debate.  New buildings are very welcome and important given the conditions that currently obtain, particularly in Mountjoy Prison.  We very much welcome them as they will improve conditions for many prisoners.  However, issues concerning accountability and independent oversight will not go away with the construction of a new building; they will be more acute because the new facility will be larger than any existing one.  Before any new project is undertaken, the systemic failures in the existing system need to be addressed, particularly through providing integrated sentence management, greater co-ordination between the prison service and other agencies, and ensuring accountability in the form of an independent complaints mechanism to ensure the concerns of prisoners are addressed adequately and effectively.  Accountability in respect of operation and design is a key issue that needs to be addressed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Not at this stage but, if there are questions, I will be happy to reply.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I welcome the delegation from the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  I apologise for not having sufficient time to engage in the debate we might otherwise have.  Is the trust is in favour of the development at Thornton Hall, as the document appears to suggest it is of the view that it will go ahead?  If it is not in favour of the project, will Dr. Kilkelly suggest how members should address the inadequacy of facilities and the need to relocate, particularly in Limerick, as well as Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution, as outlined in the report from the Council of Europe, the anti-torture sub-committee, and others as far back as the Whitaker report?  How do we compare as regards international practice in terms of the prison population per head of population?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I, too, regret that we have been unable to provide adequate time for an exchange of views.On the question of overcrowding, cell design and design as it relates to prison management, I hope the delegation has seen the design of what is proposed at Thornton Hall where there will be eight separate facilities within the perimeter.  Does the Irish Penal Reform Trust take issue with the configuration?  If it considers that it does not incorporate best principles of penal reform, what does it suggest members should do at this stage to address the issue?  As I understand it, we are essentially acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in that the Houses of the Oireachtas are the planning authority in this case.  I wonder if there are specific things we can do?
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank the Irish Penal Reform Trust for its excellent presentation and echo the remarks of Deputy Rabbitte.  Last week in the Seanad the Minister stated a preferred bidder had been selected to construct the development at Thornton Hall which will have capacity for 1,400 prisoners on the new site.  However, when referring to the big issue, he indicated that, in fact, it would have potential capacity for 2,200.  In response to a question from me he also stated prisoners might be obliged to double up in cells.  Will the delegation elaborate on what we can do as a committee about this?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I query the need for immigrant detention in the light of the provisions of the immigration Bill.  Does the Irish Penal Reform Trust have any indication in respect of capacity because it seems to run contrary to the principles of immigration policy?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I welcome the delegation from the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  Is the trust strongly in favour of the development at Thornton Hall in order to improve conditions for prisoners?On the issue of co-location of the Central Mental Hospital at Thornton Hall, how does the trust respond to those who say it will be on a completely separate site from the prison?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I will attempt to answer the questions posed by Deputies Flanagan, Naughten and McGrath.  My colleague will address the questions raised by Deputy Rabbitte and Senator Bacik.On whether we are in favour of or opposed to the development at Thornton Hall, ultimately the provision of detention facilities is a matter for the Prison Service and the prerogative of the Executive.  The Deputy rightly points out that conditions in Mountjoy men's prison and St. Patrick's Institution have been below acceptable human rights standards for a long period of time.  The fact that the Government is now addressing that point is to be welcomed.  The fact that something needs to be done about those facilities does not, necessarily, lead to the conclusion that the proposed plan for Thornton Hall is the correct way to go about it.  If the intention is to provide appropriate facilities we, and other groups such as the residents of the area and groups interested in prisoners' welfare, are willing to engage constructively with the Irish Prison Service and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reach the best possible solution.The limited information we have so far gives rise to serious concerns on a number of grounds, such as the scale of the prison and some aspects of the design.  There are many aspects about which we do not know.  For example, Deputy Naughten asked about immigration facilities.  All we know is that a spokesperson for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said there will be immigration facilities.  We know very little beyond that.  This is at a time when asylum figures are dropping dramatically.  We have got by, so far, without a large-scale separate immigration facility and we do not see the need for it now.Deputy Flanagan asked how Ireland compares internationally.  Our rate of imprisonment per head of population is at about the European average at present.  It is certainly lower than our neighbour, the United Kingdom.  However, we do not have a long-term strategy for our penal system or for imprisonment as against alternatives to custody.  That is the policy vacuum in which this major development is taking place.The question of co-location with the Central Mental Hospital was raised.  As Deputy Finian McGrath will be aware, the families of residents in the Dundrum hospital and other mental health charities are very exercised regarding the stigma which will result from the hospital being at the same site as a prison.  They feel that the fact that there may be separate entrance roads does not address that problem.  There are also clinical problems associated with the dangers of losing staff and expertise in the transfer of the site.  However, that is a matter primarily for the hospital.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Deputy Rabbitte referred to the design, what the joint committee can do in response to what we know already and what change can be effected.  We have not seen the design.  To my knowledge, nothing is available.  It is suggested that particular features of the design may or may not be compliant with international standards.  We are concerned that there should be a process of ensuring that the design of the prison takes international obligations and standards into account.  I am thinking, in particular, of the European prison rules, the guidance of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, and a range of treaties to which Ireland is a party and which have a significant amount to say about how prisons should be organised and how recommendations can be adhered to within a large and small facility.  Some degree of audit that would measure the compliance of the facility's design with international standards is required.  This is a regular form of assessment which is undertaken in other countries with projects of this kind.  One should be able to identify from the guidance what needs to be taken into account and explain how the facility meets those standards.The use of small units to accommodate eight prisoners at a time has been suggested.  That does not relate to the issue of scale but it does not get away from the substantial size of a prison to accommodate, potentially, 2,000 prisoners.  Experience has been that the size of accommodation units, while not quite irrelevant, has a strong bearing on the operation of the facility, particularly where common areas are used by all prisoners.  The extent to which units are completely self-contained will have a bearing.  The common areas, medical facilities, exercise yards, recreational and education and training facilities would still have to be of the scale necessary to accommodate up to and perhaps more than 2,000 prisoners.  The organisation of the accommodation does not get away from that fact.

I regret that I must curtail further discussion as this stage.  I thank the delegation for attending at such short notice and for its presentation and responses which I am sure will be of assistance to members of the committee in their deliberations.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Before we conclude, I should have stated the obvious at the beginning.  I wish to declare an interest in that I am one of the residents living alongside the prison.  I would like the Minister to reflect that point which, under the Standards in Public Office Act, must be done
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I thank the other deputations which have attended at such short notice.  Owing to circumstances beyond our control we were unable to accommodate them between 1 p.m. and 1.45 p.m.  Another meeting is due to commence at 2 p.m.  We will discuss the situation at that meeting and hope to be able to accommodate them this afternoon.  I hope they will be able to stay around.  We will be in communication with them as soon as we can after the commencement of the meeting at 2 p.m.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Thank you, Vice Chairman.  I do not know whether we have had any communication from the Government Whip but, as we discussed at some length in private session, this arrangement is unsatisfactory.  I hope there will be an indication from the Government Whip that we will be able to facilitate the other groups during the afternoon.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I welcome the witnesses.  At the joint committee meeting held earlier today we agreed to accommodate those groups wishing to make a presentation to the members on the motion on Thornton Hall and who, due to time constraints, had not been able to make a presentation at the earlier meeting.  Due to time constraints I advise members that a number of housekeeping matters, including travel to attend an OECD convention, will be heard at the end of the meeting.  Before we consider the justice motion we will hear a presentation by those groups that missed out at lunch time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews will hear the motions.  Each group in turn will make a short, five minute presentation, followed by a question and answer session lasting ten minutes.I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that while members of this committee have absolute privilege, this privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee.  The committee cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it.  Under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I welcome Mr. J. J. Cummins and invite him to begin by introducing those who are attending with him.  He will then have five minutes to make his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	16	With me are Ms Maura Norton and Ms Una Martin.  I thank the committee for allowing us to make this presentation and giving us the chance to explain our position.  We wish to concentrate on the impact of the proposed prison on the local community.  We are called the Concerned Residents Group.  We represent a group of neighbours who have serious concerns about some aspects of the prison development.  While we do not want the prison in our area we have come to accept that it will be there and therefore we want to get the best deal from the situation in which we find ourselves for the community and ourselves.  Our group of neighbours has made a detailed submission as part of the consultation process, which ended on 11 April.  This was drawn up on our behalf by an environmental consultant who cost us a great deal of money.  We represent the 97 signatories of that submission, all of whom are from the local area.  We identified a large number of concerns in that report and we are not represented by any other group.We have spent over €11,000 on consultancy fees to assist us with the environmental report, as well as a planning consultant, to help us deal with the matter of an ACA on our properties.  This is a significant financial commitment and worry to those concerned.  A report has recently been issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the environmental impact assessment and the report of the rapporteur on the proposed prison development at Thornton Hall.We acknowledge that much effort was invested in obtaining a new dedicated road for the proposed prison and the Minister's report properly addressed local concerns about preventing heavy construction traffic using a local road where a school is located.  However, on the other hand, this report gave very little to the community and there are four principal concerns which were not addressed adequately or at all.The first is that the wall of the proposed prison is too close to our properties.  We made a submission as part of the consultation process and asked that the wall be moved into the prison site away from our properties by a meaningful amount.  Specifically, we requested the wall be moved back by 60 m.  The Minister's report stated it would only be moved by between 4 m and 10 m in some areas and it is not at all clear where those areas will be.  This is a token and half-hearted gesture to our real concerns, which will affect us for the rest of our lives.By moving the wall back into the site, the following positive effects will occur.  The visual impact on our properties will be lessened and operational noise from the prison will be reduced.  We live in a rural area and this is a real concern, as we are very close to the proposed massive development.  It is in the order of 140,000 sq. m in what is really an agriculturally-zoned area.Light pollution will be lessened, which is a major issue in a rural area which is dark at night.  One of my neighbours, Ms Martin, has a livestock and bloodstock farming enterprise adjoining the north-east boundary of the prison site.  Lighting and noise pollution is known to adversely affect the breeding of bloodstock.  This was not addressed in the EIA, although there were requests for a lighting survey.Ms Maura Norton will detail the second issue, relating to footpaths.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	17	In our submission, under the heading of safety, we asked that footpaths, cycle ways and pony trekking paths be included in the proposed development plans but these have not been granted.  There is absolutely no benefit or gain to the community.We know a direct road from the old N2 to the prison is planned and we acknowledge this is a big addition.  However, it is only reasonable to assume there will be a significant increase in the volume of traffic on all the minor roads, so this is a major safety issue.  These roads are all around the prison and as it is, the roads are extremely dangerous.  It is very important these roads and paths are built.This would give all members of our community, particularly the elderly, those with disabilities and children, some degree of safety.  This appears to have been totally rejected and dismissed.  It has not even been referred to in the Minister's observations for report.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Water and sewage improvements were also requested in the area.  We acknowledge these are largely the responsibility of Fingal County Council and it has told us it is willing to provide sewage services — it has some difficulty with improving water services — provided the prison authorities support this for the area.  No commitment was given in the Minister's report to suggest such support would be given.I will hand over to Ms Martin to outline the security issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	19	We were most surprised to see security issues only warranted three lines in the Minister's observation.  He stated in his observations on the EIA and rapporteur's report that a good neighbourhood operational implementation plan, which will address these concerns, is being drawn up by the Irish Prison Service.It is very hard for us to be confident this will take place as on 27 January 2005 we received a letter from Mr. Brian Purcell stating that in the coming weeks he was to put in place a formal mechanism for consultation with the local residents about a proposed prison development and would arrange an information meeting.  So far, almost three and a half years later, this meeting has not taken place.A few of us as residents have met members of the Irish Prison Service informally, always at our request, and they have been very helpful.  There was never a general information meeting.As I live on the high north ridge of the development, I will have clear views not only of the construction of the prison but also its operation.  This is according to the EIA and the rapporteur's report.  When I mentioned this to the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Jim Mitchell and Mr. Joe Boyle came to see me.  They were very surprised at the clear views I have of Thornton Hall and all its lands, even with the hedgerows in place.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	If the prison is to go ahead, some gain should be received by the community.  One possible issue would be the inclusion of the homes of residents in the immediate area on a ring system.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That is really a matter for the Irish Prison Service to answer.  Initially, we were told this was to be a 1,200 space prison and then it was suddenly 2,200.

I have had some experience with the issue as I was a member of Fingal County Council when the prison issue at Thornton Hall arose.  The concerned residents have taken a very measured and reasonable approach to dealing with their concerns.  I do not mean to keep returning to the sewage and water issue but I have one question.  In general terms, what level of interaction have the residents had with Fingal County Council at director of services level with regard to dealing, not just with water, drainage and sewage, but also other amenities?  The group has made a very fair point with regard to planning gain and it is important that if people are to have this facility in the area, there should be a community planning gain.  What interaction has there been and how frequent is it currently with the director of services in Fingal County Council?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	43	We had two meetings with them, with one before Christmas and one more recently.  The last was with Mr. Alan Carty of the water services department.  Their approach is that they are quite supportive, provided they receive support from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Irish Prison Service to help with infrastructural issues.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	44	This is an issue I wish to tease out, although I do not want to hold the meeting up.  It has been indicated the local authority will be very supportive if the Irish Prison Service and the Department are supportive.The sewerage schemes were mentioned.  What other members of Fingal County Council said they would support the residents and have we got this in writing as something we can bring to the Minister?

Given the points mentioned this evening, I am more than happy, as a Government Deputy, to raise these issues with the Minister directly.  We must be reasonable and I know the area around Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan and Rolestown very well because I grew up in north Dublin.  If this facility proceeds there will be big changes in the area and planning is crucially important.  I will come back to this because I know there will be further discussions.

I have some questions that the delegates might bank and answer collectively later.Ms Norton mentioned the footpaths, cycle track and pony trekking path to be installed on her local roads and in one section of the prison grounds.  Can she expand on this issue?  She also mentioned the impact on people with disabilities.  Security issues and stress levels were mentioned in the submission; what kind of concerns do the delegates have in this regard?  I am not sure whether the delegates had time to mention concerns relating to drainage and flooding; can the delegates advise the committee on their concerns in this regard?  I share the concerns of the delegates regarding the nearness of the proposed wall and this is something on which we should all support them.I will support the submission of the delegates in my own submission to the Minister.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	48	As the Vice Chairman will know, I am personally involved in this matter.  It has not been made clear so far that the area in question is, in terms of population, like the most remote area in the Vice Chairman's constituency.  There are no shops, pubs or anything else in Kilsallaghan.  The people on both sides here must get into their cars to buy a newspaper.  I say this because paths and cycle ways develop normally when there is a growing population.  There will be an extra population in the area and footpaths might sound like a small matter but there will be safety issues.  The only industry in the area is a horse riding centre nearby and the matter of footpaths and cycle ways may prove difficult.In terms of sewerage facilities, and Deputy O'Brien may take this point, everyone is supportive but nobody is doing anything.  Both groups feel this is a good idea but the Prison Service or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should deal directly with the local authority to make it happen, rather than tell these people that they have their support.  These people have other work to do.With regard to moving the wall back, there is a cordon sanitaire of approximately 30 m behind it, it is shown in the grey patch, so there is sufficient space to use without affecting the accommodation.  This would reduce the space between the 7.2 metre perimeter wall and where the cells are.  This is all it would do; it would not reduce the actual space.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I shall begin with Deputy Darragh O'Brien's point.  When we spoke to the Irish Prison Service we found it could be supportive in certain respects, as could Fingal County Council, but there was no meeting of minds.  There is an element of things falling between stools and this must be addressed.  Senator O'Toole dealt with the matter of footpaths.There are serious concerns about security in the area.  People with no experience of this kind of thing are anxious about undesirable people being attracted to the area.  Disabled and old people living in the area are concerned and people living in remote houses feel vulnerable.  Three lines in the Minister's report do not address adequately such genuine concerns.Regarding stress levels, there have been many meetings and quasi promises.  We are in limbo and do not know what is happening, which causes concern.  There are local concerns also and the whole issue, including appearing before this committee today and incurring the expense of hiring consultants, has caused a great deal of stress.On drainage, an environmental impact assessment, EIA, filling four lever-arch folders, was conducted, which seemed very professional.  One of the aspects of this dealt with drainage and it shows how dismissive we feel the process was in certain respects.  It was issued on the last day of February and about four to five weeks later there was a deluge of rain that saw two areas of the site flooded.  However, the EIA report said there were no known records of flooding in the area.  With that we rest our case.

Ní leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh inár dteanga fhéin.  On behalf of the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, I thank the members of the committee for the invitation to address them as they consider this matter.  I speak on the work of the Centre for Faith and Justice on penal policy over the past number of years and I draw on my personal experience as a regular visitor to the Mountjoy complex and a number of other prisons.It has been 13 years since I first visited the Mountjoy complex and in my capacity as a visiting chaplain I go there almost every week.  Over the 13 years I have come to know members of staff and many of the mainly young males who go through the complex regularly.  I have seen at first hand the facilities and regime the proposed development at Thornton Hall seeks to replace.  Nobody could argue that the facilities should remain as they are because the conditions in Mountjoy's prison for men and in St. Patrick's Institution are deplorable in this day and age.  This is widely acknowledged and I am sure the members of the committee are aware of this.Nobody disputes the need to address this problem but I submit that, far from solving the major problems in our prison system, the proposals regarding Thornton Hall will simply reinforce some of them and create new ones.I submit that the motion this committee is considering is truly historic.  We are talking about a facility that will serve this country not just in this century but probably into the 22nd century if one considers that Mountjoy is fast approaching its 160th anniversary.  This therefore is a facility of historic importance and will outlast each of us here.  The proposed prison is also historic in that it is the largest penal facility that has been proposed in the history of the State.  We are told it will be capable of holding up to 2,200 men, women and potentially children, although the initial estimate is that it will be lower than 1,400.One of my key concerns in considering such a historic and costly use of penal resources is that it will substantially increase the number of prison places in the State.  As regards the scale of it, if one considers that our current prison population hovers below 3,500, to have a potential of 2,200 in the one campus, complex or site is a major policy decision that demands much more development than has been given to this matter to date.  Thornton Hall, as proposed, is not just about replacing buildings in Mountjoy; it is a means of creating the capacity to imprison many more people, thus increasing our prison capacity by almost 150%.  The prison development is on a massive scale and it impacts greatly on our penal policy as a whole.  It reinforces our inability to use imprisonment as a measure of last resort, and potentially limits both the commitment to developing alternatives to prison and, indeed, the resources available for such alternatives.A key reason for thinking that the plans concerning Thornton Hall are questionable is that they have been developed in the absence — this is something that really saddens me — of a thorough consultation with people who work with prisoners in prison and in the community.  The process has lacked transparency, consultation and rigorous scrutiny.  Detailed information has not been forthcoming.  The exclusion of potential valuable insights, experience from practitioners, governors, prison officers, teachers, prison chaplains and other interested parties — I suggest prisoners, families of ex-prisoners and ex-prisoners — have not been gathered to make this the best possible response to the needs of the Mountjoy complex, which is inadequate.  We have not gathered the richness of experience that could lead to a much better response.  A prison officer with almost 30 years experience said to me last Saturday that Thornton Hall was "an idea of the suits".  He said that such people had no idea what it was like on the ground and that they had got it wrong.  His views and frustrations are ones that I come across routinely among staff of the Irish Prison Service though they may not always be articulated in such a pithy manner.I have a concern that the cost of Thornton Hall may absorb other resources.  I do not know what the full cost of the prison is to be and have not seen this figure in any official documentation.  What I gather suggests that the amount the taxpayer may pay to the public private partnership could be as much as, or close to, the entire budget for the probation service.  That is a serious consideration.My key belief is that we resort too readily to prison which is counter-productive, expensive and damaging.  While acknowledging the serious rise in violent crime, particularly homicide, and the need for a response when prison is required, the fact remains that a significant number of people who are currently committed to prison would, in my opinion, be better dealt with by the use of non-custodial alternatives.  Instead of pursuing a policy of expanding prison places, there is scope to reduce significantly the number of places and to deploy penal resources in the development of more effective punishments.When I started to write about Thornton Hall, I began with the story of "John".  John was the first person I visited in prison over 13 years ago.  He was imprisoned in St. Patrick's as a 16 year old and has been in and out of prison for many years.  He was a homeless child and teenager and is now a homeless adult.  Probably his worst year was 2007.  He spent five different periods in prison in that year, a total of almost 200 days, at the cost of, on average, €60,000 to the Irish Prison Service, more if the cost of having gardaí in the courts is included.  Each time he came out, including the last time, in September 2007, he was still homeless, still addicted and still offending at least once a day.  Only through the intervention of a voluntary body in late November has he been helped move into treatment.  I cite his story because he is really doing well at the moment.  The Irish Prison Service cannot be blamed for not attending to his needs.  In 2006, 40% of people committed to prison were like John in that they got sentences of less than three months.  In the same year 80% of people committed got sentences of less than a year.  The question of Thornton Hall is intrinsically linked to how we mis-use our penal resources.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank Fr. O'Riordan for talking to the committee.  Much of the talk about Thornton Hall has been in the context of it being a super prison.  Does Fr. O'Riordan, drawing on his experience and his work, regard it in that light?  He mentioned the consultation process.  Unlike other members, I was not here before the last election and thus missed the earlier part of the debate concerning the site purchase and the agreement in principle about building the prison.With regard to Fr. O'Riordan's position at the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, and acknowledging the contribution he makes towards prisoners and penal reform and in matters of prison and detention, did he have any part in this process?  Was he formally invited by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be part of the consultation process in any way?  I note that under the law there was a statutory six-week period in which to make submissions and I note that Fr. O'Riordan made a submission to Mr. Jim Farrelly, the special rapporteur.  Other than that, what was his role in terms of advice?  Was he invited to air his views?  Regarding his submission to Mr. Farrelly, what was the nature of the response?  What was his relationship with that office?  Was there discourse or any drawing upon Fr. O'Riordan's experience?I am very pleased that Fr. O'Riordan has attended the committee meeting.  It is regrettable his contribution to the committee is very much in the 24th hour.  Since he has been here this morning we have managed to convince the Government to give some extra time to the process on which the committee is engaged.  Perhaps Fr. O'Riordan will elaborate on his contribution to date or on that of the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice in the planning and development of the prison.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	We should not get hung up on whether to describe it as a super prison.  If a facility has the capacity to detain 2,200 people the question is one of size.  I accept that, though I have not seen details of how the regime will operate, whether it is to be laid out in a modular fashion or on a number of different sites.  I have some concerns in that history shows us that Wheatfield Prison was designed on a modular basis.  It was proposed that it would have the potential for 20 separate regimes, each with an amazing amount of independence.  It was designed for young offenders but has never operated on that basis.  It operates poorly in terms of the 20 modules that exist on the site.  This is a danger not intended by the current proposers of Thornton Hall, but such a disaster could occur.  Our role has been minimal and certainly has been on the outside, although I am not sure we have any particular right to be in it, but I am sad to see that other people whose opinions I value and who have years of experience in the Irish Prison Service have been alienated.  People who should be advocates for the Irish Prison Service feel completely shut out from this process.  As far back as October 2006, and several times since then, I contacted the Irish Prison Service unsolicited to see whether I could contribute, but to date I have not received any acknowledgement of that invitation.The report of the rapporteur, Mr. Farrelly, is based on a report commissioned by Jacobs, which did what it was asked to do.  However, from my perspective of concern for prisoner and community welfare, Jacobs was concerned very much with what I call "bats and badgers".  If we count the instances, we find there are more mentions of bats and badgers in the Jacobs report than of prisoner welfare.  The rapporteur states in his introduction that his report is just a summary and he does not comment on the 130 submissions received.  He does say, which perhaps indicates something of his frustration, that he has two four-drawer filing cabinets full of submissions.  The only formal response to Mr. Farrelly's report was that of the Minister, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 May, and which I have.  We can see there is one page responding to the concerns raised about the impact on prisoners.  Surely the most important impact of this facility will be on prisoners and, by extension, the wider community.  It is appalling and disillusioning that more consideration has not been given to the impact on prisoners and more consultation has not been carried out in this regard.  We need to go back to the drawing board.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I appreciate Fr. O'Riordan taking the time to make this submission.  What exactly is he asking us to do?  We find ourselves in an unusual position.  Normally a development of this size — a prison — would be handled under the 2001 planning regulations, but this, uniquely, falls under the remit of the 2007 Act.  Instead of the Minister having the power of approval, as he had under the 2001 regulations, this is now a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is essentially a planning application.  Is Fr. O'Riordan saying to us that to provide such a large capacity for prison detention is a major change of policy, that he is in favour of a more non-custodial approach for people who do not commit violent offences, and that he is urging adoption of established principles of penal reform?  In other words, is he making a policy statement?  Alternatively, is he advising us, in the context of the planning application, how we should alter the configuration of what is provided for in the documents we have?I am afraid Fr. O'Riordan will say that he does not have the documents.  This highlights the situation we are in.  The land is bought.  We have been over that territory and we will not go over it again.  A preferred bidder has apparently been signed up, even if he has not been signed up, we know who he is.  Work is due to commence.  One of the Deputies here said he wanted to get this person on board over the summer, but I think the summer has just happened over the last couple of weeks, and we are here discussing it post hoc.  I am finding it difficult to understand how we can exert influence on the project.  It seems the submissions from Fr. O’Riordan, the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the residents adjacent to the proposed development and other residents and bodies that have an interest in this area should have taken place before we found ourselves confronted with a document that contains the proposed layout of the prison.  I do not know whether Fr. O’Riordan can help us but I ask him his views on the plans for the design and configuration of the prison facility against the policy backdrop he spelled out.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	To add to what was said earlier, the work being done by the centre is absolutely outstanding and is much appreciated.  It is sad to recognise the lack of involvement of people such as Fr. O'Riordan in the Irish Prison Service although they could bring their expertise to bear on it.  We are looking at a post hoc situation, as Deputy Rabbitte said.  One issue has come up despite this.  I spent two weekends going through three big boxes of documents and read as many as I could.  It was not much easier to get through than the Lisbon treaty, to tell the truth, but I went through it all.  There is a suggestion that there would be 2,000 plus people in the prison, as opposed to 1,000.  I would like to hear Fr. O’Riordan’s views on this.  Even allowing for the logic of the suits, it appears to throw that backwards on its head.  Perhaps Fr. O’Riordan would explain that to us.My second question is related to what Deputy Rabbitte said.  If Fr. O'Riordan had the opportunity to make two changes to what is inevitably in front of us, what would those changes be?

We can deal with the Minister on that, as we have done in the past.  In terms of what is in front of us and the facilities that will be contained in the building, are there facilities that Fr. O'Riordan would recommend to increase family ties, given that the site is far away from the area in which the families of most prisoners in Mountjoy are currently living?  Their families currently have ready access to the prison in that it is quite close and there is a proper bus service and public transport.  What facilities should be included within the prison that would enhance family ties, which are important in terms of rehabilitation?  Families provide stability, which is important for prisoners who are to be released.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Deputy Rabbitte asked what I am asking the committee to do.  That was the way I noted down his question.  I am asking the committee to pause or stop this process because it is a bad idea.  One point we raised in our submission to the rapporteur was that we thought it involved a highly questionable chain of decision making in which the Minister, who is the proposer and the developer of the site, commissions his own environmental impact study and is then to be the arbiter of that study.  He could also commission a further supplementary process.  We thought that chain of decision making was highly suspect.  I note the response to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — and I would encourage the committee to take this seriously — states that the deciding authority under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 is the Oireachtas, not the Minister.  I have a difficulty accepting that the committee is as tide-bound as it suggests, but perhaps I am not fully au fait with the procedures of the House.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I have no political affiliation, but it would be in the best interests of the country if we could rise above the divisions and examine what is in the best interests of the country and what is the best possible penal policy.  This is historic and once we go down this road, we will be stuck with this for decades to come.  As for accepting the proposals and suggesting modifications I believe the new facility, as proposed, is a bad idea.  I will outline the two elements which I find most objectionable.  First, I object to the proposed facility to house 16 and 17 year olds within the complex.  It is appalling that, in this day and age, we could contemplate building such a facility.  I dispute the necessity for it, given that a dedicated facility for such an age group is planned and will be delivered at Lusk.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Even as a temporary facility?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Even as a temporary facility.  If we need a temporary facility, the strategy of keeping people from this age group in the care of the Irish Prison Service within an adult complex is in breach of every international principle on the detention of children.  It shows the extent of the unenlightened minds that have proposed the facility and it is most objectionable.  The justification made is that the centre will not be used and that it could be used for adult prisoners afterward.  I would like to understand the thinking which suggests that a building designed for children, using the principles of best practice for care of children, can suddenly be adapted for adult use and I fear for the type of facility that is being built.I also object to the decision to relocate the main prison for women and, in the process, double its capacity.  Some two weeks ago we hosted, along with the Bar Council, a seminar on women in prison in which the keynote speaker was Baroness Jean Corston, who has undertaken a major review of the situation of women in prison in England and Wales.  As as result she has become an expert on the situation in many other countries.  She said that in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, governments are setting their face against the very policy that appears to be being implemented in Ireland.  Her basic point is that women prisoners need to be treated differently from men, which has been done very successfully in the Dóchas Centre and it is one of the services, both nationally and internationally, of which we can be very proud.  There is no need for the relocation and Mr. Farrelly's report states that the relocation of the Dóchas Centre is a backward step.  Its retention at its current location must be given further consideration.  There appears no purposeful reason for the relocation of both this centre and the training unit, other than to maximise the revenue realised from the sale of the entire Mountjoy site.  These views are from section 9.4 in Mr. Farrelly's report, although I should say that I doubt these represent his opinions; he is summarising a submission, possibly our own.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the possible modifications and the two points mentioned above address that question.I met a prisoner this morning and I told him I was appearing before the committee.  I asked what I should say and he said to ask committee members what they would do and how they would feel if one of their children were sent to this massive complex.Prison should be a matter of last resort and it is the most serious exercise of State power against the individual.  There is no doubt there are individuals for whom it is the only possible response, but I suggest we overuse it in this country.  This proposal will see a further expansion of this trend and it will undermine current developments such as the report of the Commission on Restorative Justice and the proposals on youth justice.  It will rob these initiatives of valuable resources.  We need to go back to the drawing board.  This facility will be around for a long time and I do not see the need to rush.  Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's institution are deplorable, but let us get an alternative and move forward, not regress.  I thank the committee for its time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thank the committee for allowing the group time this evening.  I am joined by my neighbour Mr. Alan Manning.  We have been members of the Rolestown and St. Margaret's Action Group for the past three and a half years.  I am somewhat nervous and unprepared because of the short notice, but I thank the committee for the invitation.  It is no secret that the Rolestown and St. Margaret's Action Group is totally opposed to the proposed development since it was first brought to the group's attention in January 2005.  In the past three and a half years we have done our utmost to highlight the flawed process that allowed a totally unsuitable site to be purchased and the unsuitability and unsustainable nature of the proposal.  We are not opposed to the proposal because it is a prison, but because of its size and scale.  It is the equivalent of a small town being imposed on any rural area in Ireland.  It involves not only 2,200 prisoners, but also the staff and auxiliary services that must be there to facilitate the development.  A development of this size cannot be hidden away in a rural area.On the matter of representation I wish to address a question from Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  The group represents more than 300 families in the greater Rolestown and St. Margaret's parishes.  It represents nine of the 11 families and landowners whose houses are on the proposed site.  The group has gained much credibility since its formation, has conducted itself well and we appreciate the invitation here today.  The group finds itself at the stage of the process where the proposal may become a reality.I wish to draw the committee's attention to the group's belief that the environmental impact assessment is inadequate, incomplete, inaccurate and misleading.  We consider it to be seriously flawed.  The group pointed out in its submission that the consultation process did not consider the residents of the area to be stakeholders in the proposed development, which represents a very significant change to our immediate environment.  Serious omissions include the lack of an environmental impact assessment on lands adjoining the land bank proposed for this development.  Lands which flood and drain onto the site at Thornton Hall were not included in the assessment and we do not know the reason for this.  We brought this to the attention of the rapporteur but nothing has been done.  One of our serious concerns is that eight out of the 11 land holdings will be flooded should the development proceed as planned.  The impact on farming and indigenous industry was not adequately addressed in the environmental impact assessment.  The impact of future developments, such as the development of the Central Mental Hospital, the forensic unit, Garda stations and private industries or other developments which may come were not addressed in the environmental impact assessment.  No surveys were carried out of the impact on the surrounding houses of an access pass being tunnelled under the R130.  We have seen the problems that happen with tunnelling for the metro and the port tunnel.  There was a totally inadequate investigation regarding flooding.  No baseline figures were taken for much of the surrounding land so we have no clue what the impact will be.  If we do not have baseline figures, how can mitigating measures be put in place to prevent flooding?  How can those issues be addressed?We have engaged in this process and made our submissions.  Not all our submissions were addressed in the rapporteur's report.  That is not a criticism of the rapporteur.  As was said already, 40 pages must reflect two filing cabinets full of submissions.  The report cannot highlight the detail and significance of these submissions.  The Minister's reply does not address the serious issues we have raised, such as the effect of lighting on livestock in the area.  Why is a physical wall needed as a boundary?  Surely in this day and age other things could be used as a boundary.  It is disingenuous how the devastating impact it will have on the community has been written off as "significant" with nothing to follow up on that.Nothing in this plan is enlightened.  Since it was announced three and a half years ago every academic working in the area of criminal law has said it is a bad plan and that we should be reducing the number of places.  Everybody working in the area of criminal reform has also said it is a bad plan.  The only people who appear to think it is a good plan are the planners in the Irish Prison Service.  We believe the plan will be outdated before the project is completed.  At this late stage, we still believe it can be stopped.  What is there at present is a land bank and a plan.  However, there are other land banks and other plans.  One that will not go ahead, we believe, is the national children's hospital.  It is urgently needed but because of funding it might not proceed.  Many other plans have not been implemented.  Consider the voting machines.  It is not beyond the ability of the Government to shelve plans and reconsider to find a better way.If it must go ahead, we wish to address certain issues within the Minister's report and the motion before the Dáil.  I do not know if I have time to do that now.  Perhaps we should give the committee a written report but I will continue until the committee stops me.  The Minister's report is the reply he made to the rapporteur’s report on all the submissions made in the EIA.  He states that it is not viable to refurbish or replace the facility on the Mountjoy site.  We challenge this; of course it is feasible.  Has he never heard of a high rise building, especially now that the Government has bought extra land beside Mountjoy?  If the Mountjoy site can be turned into a multifaceted development for Dublin’s inner city, why can it not include a place for incarceration?A large scale development, whether it is a prison or housing estate, will affect those living in the immediate area.  If this was any other development, it would have to go through the usual rigours of the planning process.  It would not get through that because it would not be in keeping with the local area plan of Fingal County Council.  The Minister also said there is not a significant national or regional impact.  How does he know that?  No strategic environmental assessment was carried out.  We have been asking for such an assessment since the beginning of this process, yet the Minister can claim there is no national or regional impact.The Minister says considerable efforts have been made to minimise the impact of the development on the residents in the area.  What considerable efforts have been made?  There was a small amount of tree planting, some wood fencing and a concrete wall.  The road that has been provided is not for the residents and it was provided because the existing road was not suitable.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I understand.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Deputy Rabbitte, Senator O'Toole and Deputy Ó Snodaigh have indicated that they wish to ask questions.  I ask them to be brief.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I thank the delegates from St. Margaret's Action Group for their submission.  It puts us in the surreal position of learning about and discussing these important issues in the wake of the decision effectively having been made to locate a prison in this rural area.  I visited the area and met many of the residents directly affected.  I heard what they had to say and viewed the school and the area.  To be truthful, it is difficult to see how the project can be halted, given the expenditure of public money and so forth.  There is a need for a prison facility because of the extent of decrepitude of the outdated facilities in Mountjoy.  Our instinctive approach is to deal with issues in the context of what is manageable and capable of being done, and it does not appear that the redevelopment of the Mountjoy site will be considered by the authorities.  We must make the best of what we have before us.  I say that reluctantly because I do not believe it is a suitable place for a prison anyway.However, I wish to clarify the local issues.  I met the families concerned.  The St. Margaret's Action Group, for those who are not familiar with the geography of the area, claims to represent eight of the 11 families in closest proximity——
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	76	We do indeed.  The Rolestown and St. Margaret's Action Group is so named because it represents residents of two parishes, Rolestown and St. Margaret's, both of which will experience an immediate impact.  Look at the picture of the site.  It is a type of oval shape and there are residents along one side and two on the north side of it.  Nine of the 11 families whose land immediately adjoins the site are part of our action group.  I would hate the committee to think there are factions in the area because we are all looking for the same thing.  We have just pursued it in different ways.  The Rolestown and St. Margaret's Action Group has always been totally opposed to the proposition.  We believe it is morally, environmentally and socially wrong.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The point made by Ms McDonnell is valid.  People at different times have different views.  This project landed on the community and it created tensions.  People are trying to deal with it.  Mr. Manning is a former pupil of mine, which is why he is so well turned out.  It is important to explain to people that inasmuch as the committee might be restricted in dealing with this, as Deputy Rabbitte has outlined, it will certainly listen to the ideas from the groups before it this evening.  Perhaps it can then find a way to put forward amendments or proposals for the plan.I can endorse the point made by Ms McDonnell.  One sentence in the Minister's report states that there is no engineering analysis available that suggests a 7.2 m perimeter wall will have an adverse effect on wind energy facilities in the area.  One submission out of the four boxes of submissions referred to wind energy.  It was mine.  I made the point that I had intended to set up a 6 kw wind generator in my back garden.  The people who came to install it said that if there was not a 100 m run, the air would be turbulent and would not direct the energy.  The Minister's comment, therefore, is a direct contradiction of that.There is also the issue of flooding, which was mentioned by both groups.  Look at the map.  The area is 150 acres and it is in fields at present.  Water flows out from it and creates flooding.  Within a month of the EIA report, which stated there was no flooding problem, two roads in the area were impassible.  One could not drive through the flooding in one's car.  When that area is covered in concrete, where will the water go?  Members are raising practical issues which I will certainly raise later.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I welcome Ms McDonnell and Mr. Manning and thank them for their submission.  It is important that the committee hears their views.  All of my colleagues on the committee support that position because we are trying to hear all sides of the story.  Ms McDonnell says the Rolestown and St. Margaret's Action Group represents 300 families, while the other group which appeared before the committee represents 97.  Does that mean there are approximately 397 families in the immediate area which are totally opposed to the prison?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Just to clarify the matter, it is 97 people.  If a poll was conducted, I believe it would show that far more than that number are opposed to the development.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	It is 100%.  Nobody is in favour of it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Is nobody in the local community in favour of the prison?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Nobody we know of has spoken in praise of the development.  People have asked what can be done about it.  The legislation allows the Minister to carry out supplementary EIAs.  We brought it to his attention that a large amount of land had not been included in the EIA.  The plan talks about not using the R130 but there is no talk about Garristown Lane, Glebe Lane, Green Lane and Newbarn Lane, all of which are even smaller than the R130 and which will be used as rat runs for construction traffic and, when it is up and running, visitor traffic.  There is provision for a secondary EIA if the Minister wishes.  We could ask for a more extensive EIA if the project must go ahead.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Did Ms McDonnell say the homes of nine of the 11 families were flooded recently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	No, I said nine of the 11 families were actually in the Thornton landbank.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	There were two main flooded areas.  One was where it is intended to put the water attenuation facility for surplus water, which is beside Senator O'Toole's house.  Further up the road, where it is intended to put the sewage pumps, was completely flooded and impassible.  It is obvious nothing has been done with regard to engineering works.

One is as a planning authority because that is the job we have been given.  We must examine the EIA in detail.  Ms McDonnell said there were inaccuracies in the report.  If there were inaccuracies in a report before any other planning forum, it would be necessary to restart the process from scratch.  Can Ms McDonnell point out each of those inaccuracies within the next week because the committee must take a decision on this matter next Tuesday?  The rapporteur was supposed to reflect and list all the submissions he had received.  Again, an indication has been given that he has not complied with this requirement.  If so, it would constitute an inaccuracy and flaw in the planning application before the committee.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Ms McDonnell mentioned that she might have an opportunity to commit the main points to paper.  If she has not already done so, the members of the committee would find it useful in our discussions with the Minister.  Senator O'Toole interjected to say he was satisfied, as a resident in the area, that 100% of the residents were opposed to the development.  Deputy McGrath said the committee was opposed to it.  Who is in favour of the project?  The Government has spent almost €40 million from public funds on it.  We are now on the eve of ratification and wondering who is in favour of it.  Did the delegates meet their local councillors and Deputies?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	We did and they are against it.  Fingal County Council has brought forward several motions to that effect.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Who supports the project in the local area?  Senator O'Toole says 100% of the residents are opposed to it.  However, the Government has already spent €40 million.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I do not know one person who supports it.

I was one of the councillors who voted against this development when I was one of 24 on Fingal County Council.  There is a sense in north Dublin that it will get not just this project but every major project because it has a landbank.  I will not go into other issues.We have reached the 24th hour on this project.  It would be helpful if the points made by the delegates were committed to paper and given to the committee in order that it can discuss the matter in more detail on 17 June.  Obviously, as somebody from the area, it is not something I would like to see happen.  However, if the prison project is to go ahead, what does the Rolestown and St. Margaret's Action Group believe can be done to ease the problem?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The first thing that must be done is to seek a new EIA that is proper, all-encompassing and includes all stakeholders.  There is still time to go back to the drawing board; it is not too late to do so.  If the project is allowed to proceed, funding will be allocated to it ahead of social housing, schools, public medical care facilities and services for people with disabilities.  We are setting ourselves up for a "build it and we will fill it" scenario.  The place will be filled if it is built ahead of other projects.  It is the lack of social inclusion projects in education, social housing and services for people with disabilities that leads to prison occupants.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	On a point of information, there was a €10 million underspend in Fingal on social housing.  That money was allocated by the Government to Fingal County Council and it was not spent last year.  I understand the point Ms McDonnell is making but it is not all about central government.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I am referring to Dublin city centre where three large projects have been pulled.

I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Barry Andrews, together with his officials who are attending to assist with our consideration of this motion.  We will receive a short presentation from the Minister of State which will be followed by a question and answer session.  We have been here all day and I suggest a synopsis of the most important part of the Minister of State's presentation might be acceptable to all at this stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	97	There are four parts to the motion.  I will deal with the first, which is a draft framework decision on taking account of convictions in the member states of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings.  On the Vice Chairman's suggestion, I will just give a brief synopsis of it.In essence, the principle of this framework decision obliges member states to take into account previous convictions handed down in other member states in accordance with their own national laws.  This instrument determines the conditions under which, in the course of criminal proceedings against a person in a member state, previous convictions handed down against the same person for different facts in other member states, are taken into account.  Following adoption of the framework decision Ireland would be obliged to assimilate previous convictions in other EU member states with previous national convictions in accordance with national law.The instrument will apply to all stages of criminal proceedings, namely pretrial, trial and execution.  For example, the information can be brought forward at bail hearings as well as to the sentencing hearing.It is important to note that convictions previously handed down in Ireland cannot be altered by this instrument.  They will be safeguarded from any interference, review or revocation during new criminal proceedings in another member state.This proposal is concerned with establishing a framework to allow for other EU member states' convictions to be taken into account in accordance with national law and does not deal with the execution of sentences.  The scope of the framework decision is limited to convictions handed down by criminal courts.There is a link between this framework decision and a Council framework on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between member states which this committee examined on 7 May 2008.  The implementation of that framework decision will allow for improved exchange of information between the relevant authorities of the member states on convictions within the territory of member states.  The framework decision is another step towards facilitating taking into account that information in certain court proceedings in accordance with our national law.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, for coming in and informing us of the framework decision.  I will be brief because this was a matter upon which we had detailed discussion at this committee in the past and I do not believe there are significant changes to the current text.Is the Minister of State satisfied as to the capability of the computer records of this jurisdiction, in terms of information gathering and the processing of the appropriate data on the convictions, to deal with the matters that will be decided upon?  He mentioned that applications for bail would be included, recorded and taken into account.Appeals might take place at a date outside the normal length of time allowed, for example, 14 days or 28 days.  In the event of such a late appeal being successful, I am sure provision can be made for the transmission and ultimate storage of such data.In the unlikely event that there would be a mistaken judgment or a conviction that ultimately might prove to be unsound in the national jurisdiction, what safeguards are there that such information would be transmitted in time?On the area of spent convictions in which the Minister of State took an interest in his capacity as a Deputy, I presume where a conviction is spent in one jurisdiction a similar data transmission service would be set up to take account of such a change in circumstances.Given the considerable element of mobility between the various states within the European Union, often there can be difficulty in ascertaining identity.  How will we be sure the obligations on the member states will be met by there being certainty on the matter of identity?  I welcome the process and thank the Minister of State.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	99	What exactly does "taking into account" mean?  Does it mean that where a person is sentenced the court must take into account the person's previous EU convictions?  Is it mandatory or discretionary?  Does it apply beyond the sentencing context?The Minister of State said in his submission that it applies to bail hearings.  Even in the sentencing context there are major resource implications.  How is the Garda and the DPP to ascertain whether a person has convictions in any or all of the other member states?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	This deals with previous convictions.  In our jurisdiction they are taken into account after conviction and prior to sentencing.  As far as I know, however, that is not the case in other jurisdictions.  In other jurisdictions they are taken into account beforehand.  If that is so and if we are to transmit this information to a state which takes into account previous convictions during a case, are we not contradicting our own approach?  There are certain offences which are classed as criminal in Ireland but which are not categorised in this way in other jurisdictions.  I did not have an opportunity to collate a full set of notes in respect of this matter.  However, it might reflect badly on a person convicted of a criminal offence here if his or her record was raised in a court in another jurisdiction where such an offence is not classed as criminal.  I do not know if account is taken of the equivalence issue in respect of such criminal offences.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	101	It is the case that convictions in another member state can be taken into account, in an informal way, in Irish courts.  This is done in sentencing.  If, therefore, a person is found guilty of an offence, the absence or presence of convictions in other member states can be considered at the discretion of the trial judge.  A judge is not obliged to look behind the conviction or the manner in which it was arrived at in another member state, he or she simply has the discretion to factor it in.  In such circumstances, counsel for an accused person can raise objections in the normal way.  That is the current position.  The framework decision will not make a great deal of difference to Ireland because the system it proposes is already in operation here.  Members should be aware of the fact that it will have a much larger impact on other member states.We have two years in which to implement the framework decision.  Deputy Flanagan raised concerns in respect of the figures.  A major project — the criminal justice interoperability pilot project — is in development, the aim of which is to transfer all data from the Garda to the District Court by electronic means.  In return, the District Court will provide all court outcomes for the Garda by the same means.  I hope this will assuage the Deputy's concerns.Deputy O'Shea asked whether certain information must be taken into account.  As stated, it is the responsibility of trial judges to decide whether to take into account convictions in other member states when formulating sentences.I did not quite understand Deputy Ó Snodaigh's question.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I posed two questions.  The first relates to the fact that in this jurisdiction previous convictions are taken into account at a different stage in court cases.  That is fine because it means we are in line with the framework decision.  However, if we transmit information on convictions to other member states and it is used at an earlier stage in the judicial process in those jurisdictions, will we not be contradicting what happens under our justice system?My second question relates to offences which are classed as criminal in this country but which might not be categorised as such elsewhere.  How do we deal with that aspect of the matter?  A person might be found guilty of committing an offence in another jurisdiction but that might not be the case if he or she was tried here.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	As stated, we have a system in place under which such convictions can be taken into account at the discretion of a trial judge and counsel for the accused can raise objections on the basis of the absence of equivalence or that this does not apply.  In such circumstances, a trial judge will not accept any persuasive value of a previous conviction in formulating a sentence.  That is the way the system in Ireland has operated to date.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	104	What are the implications for the way the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions will acquire knowledge of convictions in other member states?  Will they seek the information and, if so, how will it be sought and to what lengths will they go to obtain it?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The central authority in this regard in any member state is the police force.  The system here is operated by the Garda which obtains information from, for example, the constabulary in the United Kingdom and the relevant police forces in other jurisdictions.  It is from these sources that information on previous convictions would be sought.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	106	If a person from another country is charged here, will information on previous convictions elsewhere be automatically sought?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I cannot provide a definitive answer in that regard but will communicate further with the Deputy on the matter.  In the more serious cases in which citizens from other member states are convicted I understand investigations in respect of previous convictions automatically take place.  However, I will check the position and communicate further with the Deputy.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	108	That concludes our consideration of the first part of the motion.  We now move to the second part which deals with improving co-operation between the special intervention units of the member states of the European Union.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Under this proposal, a member state may request specialist assistance from another member state to help deal with a crisis brought about by a criminal offence which presents a serious direct threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions.  Any such request by a member state and any response by another member state would be entirely discretionary according to Article 3.1.  The situation envisaged would involve a large-scale crisis where a single member state may not have the means, resources or expertise to deal with it.  The scenarios envisaged are man-made crises presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions.  In particular, they include hostage-taking, hijackings and similar events.  Assistance could take the form of the provision of equipment or expertise or direct assistance on the territory of the requesting member state.  Any visiting specialist units would operate under the responsibility, authority and direction of the requesting member state.  In addition, they would only be able to operate within the limits of their own national powers.  In this instance, primary legislation will be required to give effect to the proposal.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I do not have a major problem with this proposal.  My difficulty is that if a problem arose in Ireland, because any visiting specialist units would operate under the responsibility of the requesting member state, the Garda Ombudsman Commission would be responsible for dealing with complaints.  I doubt we would ask the Garda Ombudsman Commission to operate overseas.  I do not know what procedures are in place to deal with complaints, particularly in view of the fact that not every member state has a police ombudsman.  It is not as if we would be in a position to ask the state from where a particular specialist unit had come to investigate complaints.  That is the nature of my concern.  We should have more time to consider these motions.  They are on the agenda for the European Council meeting this week, which is not satisfactory.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I welcome the proposal which is important in the context of interstate relations.  I assume it is concerned with serious crises such as an aeroplane hijacking, a threat to a large number of people or the institutions of a state and that member states will not call on the emergency units in other member states unless there was a crisis.  To allay Deputy Ó Snodaigh's reservations, I also assume this would be voluntary and that there would be no compulsion on a member state to assist, nor would set criteria kick in, that it would strictly be at the behest of the host state to issue an invitation on the basis of the crisis.  This is an important proposal.  I wish the Minister of State well in his discussions with his counterparts in the European Union.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Labour Party has no essential objections to the proposal.  With regard to the issue raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and commented on by Deputy Flanagan, are protocols in place to protect human rights and prevent abuses?  Swift action is demanded in crises but, at the same time, the European Union and the State are very much committed to protecting individuals from abuse or over enthusiastic dealings.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The origin of this proposal lies in what happened on 11 September 2001, the type of exceptional circumstance contemplated.  The provision would not be exercised lightly and attempts to expand the capacity of the Garda and police forces in other member states to deal with major crises.  As Deputy Flanagan said, it is entirely voluntary, both for the requesting state and the states providing assistance.With regard to the issues raised by Deputies Ó Snodaigh and O'Shea, it is stated:The draft Council decision sets out basic rules, including civil and penal liability, in order to provide a legal framework for circumstances whereby member states request and provide assistance.  Under the terms of the proposal, civil liabilities occurring as a result of an action by a special intervention unit of a member state would attach to the host state.  Where gross negligence or wilful misconduct occurs, the host state may approach the sending state to recover any sums expended.That is the model under which it will operate.To respond to Deputy O'Shea's other question, police officers from another member state operating on Irish territory at Ireland's request would have to operate under our direction and authority and in accordance with Irish laws while retaining their own national powers.

That will be fine if gross misconduct results but if there is gross misconduct aimed at somebody or involving an abuse of human rights, it may require the prosecution of the individual guilty of such an offence in the sending state or the receiving state.  Other than that, this needs to happen.

Under Dáil Standing Order 86(2) and Seanad Standing Order 74(2), the message is deemed to be the report of the committee.  Is it agreed there should be no further debate on the matter by Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann?  Agreed.We now move on to the Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed under the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The aim of the data protection framework decision is to ensure a high level of protection of basic rights and freedoms, in particular, the privacy of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data in the framework of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  It is important to highlight the decision only applies to the cross-border exchange of personal data.  It includes general rules on the lawfulness of processing of personal data; provisions concerning specific forms of processing, collection, storage, transmitting and making available personal data to the competent authorities of other member states; further processing, in particular, further transmission of data received from or made available by the competent authorities of other member states; rights of the data subject; measures to protect confidentiality and security of processing; and judicial remedies, liabilities, sanctions and provisions for supervisory authorities.  While it is technical and complex, the data protection framework document is not an agreement about handing over new information.  It is an agreement establishing data protection standards and, once enforced, will set uniform and appropriate data protection standards where personal data is transferred between member states or given to an EU body such as Europol.  The document also contains safeguards about the need for competent authorities to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental loss.No major issues arise for Ireland because we have implemented recent legislation in this area and have the necessary components of a robust data protection system.  Data protection in the policing area in Ireland has also been strengthened by the publication in November 2007 of a data protection code for the Garda.  The code was developed by the Garda in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and reflects the key principles of data protection best practice.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that Article 14 will require domestic legislation to allow Ireland in a situation where data originates here to refuse such consent where it is contrary to public policy or where the third state does not provide for an adequate level of data protection.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	120	A number of issues arise.  The Minister of State has stressed that the proposed framework decision concerns the protection rather than the transmission of personal data.  However, as this has implications for domestic law, perhaps he will elaborate on the Attorney General's advice that amending legislation will be required.  Will he elaborate on the type of legislative amendments that will be proposed?  When might we see them having regard to the large programme of legislation currently emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  In order to allow us participate fully in this decision, this should not take place until after we have had the opportunity of amending our own legislation.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I do not have any great problems with this measure except for the point made by the Minister about the data protection principles agreed by the Garda Síochána and the Data Protection Commissioner which ensure that effective law enforcement was not hampered.  With regard to internal law enforcement, there is a great deal of hampering of the transfer of information within the State's law enforcement machinery.  For example, there are considerable limits to the extent to which the CAB can share information, such as revenue information, with other agencies.  There is a need to review the transfer of information between State agencies and to ensure we have efficient systems for sharing data in the interests of law enforcement.  For instance, if there is cross-Border money laundering and the CAB or its Northern Ireland or UK equivalent has some knowledge, this seems to me not to be as strong and effective as it could be if there were not those issues hampering the transfer of information.  Are there any proposals to seek to assist law enforcement in the manner I am referring to, in terms of the transfer of information between agencies in the State?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I refer to the briefing note on the point of the European Parliament being reconsulted for its opinion by 1 April, which is a strange date.  It states that it is unlikely that such reconsultation would result in material changes to the text.  Why would that be?  Has it now got to a stage where even if the European Parliament produced its opinion that it will be too late?  Given the demand for the European Parliament to play a greater role in European legislation, this would seem to be an example of the Parliament being ignored.I refer to Article 17 of the framework decision which describes the right of access and outlines where data subjects are entitled to receive without constraint and without excessive delay or expense, confirmation whether data relating to them is being transmitted.  It sets out where application can be made and the conditions under which an application cannot be made.  The article states that in the main, an applicant is not entitled to access and not entitled receive an explanation.  Article 17.3 states all the counter arguments.  One is allowed ask on request but this can be denied for reasons such as to avoid obstructing officials, to protect public and national security and to protect the data subject of the rights and freedom of others.  Any refusal or restriction of access shall be set out in writing to the person looking for this information.  The communication or the right to that communication is waived where the reason is pursuant to paragraphs 2.A to 2.E, inclusive, which is all of the above.  An applicant might be refused the request and also refused a reason on the same grounds.  I find this odd.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	123	To make a general point first, as Deputy Charles Flanagan said, this is a data protection measure and to ensure good standards for the protection of data as it is exchanged across borders between member states.  This is in the context of criminal investigations only.  It is not the case that a garda can lightly enter a request to find out about an individual; the request must be in the context of a criminal investigation.  I wish to make this point clear because it is important.With regard to the concerns of the Attorney General, the Office of the Attorney General indicates there are a small number of areas which will require technical amendments or additions to domestic legislation.  One area relating to Article 14, the transfer to competent authorities in third states or international bodies, is of significance because one of the rules allowing for onward transfer to a third state of data received from another member state is that the originating member state has given its consent to the transfer, in compliance with national law.  This is the issue which the Attorney General has raised.Deputy O'Shea raised the issue of the transfer of information between State agencies.  My understanding is that the CAB and the Revenue Commissioners have become an international best practice example in the exchange of information and securing details about individuals who are involved in either cross-border money laundering otherwise.  This issue is not related to the internal exchange of data between State agencies but rather it is about the cross-border exchange of information.  The Deputy's comments about what he perceives as the inadequacies of State agencies, are noted.In reply to Deputy Ó Snodaigh, the European Parliament was consulted and reconsulted on 1 April.  We cannot compel the Parliament to produce its own observations.  However, it has until the end of this year to make its observations.  The Danish Government also has strong concerns under this heading so we will wait and see what will happen in due course.

They might have spotted something which we have not noticed.  Considering these issues are of concern to all member states, we should aim to inform ourselves of the concerns of other groups or states.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	126	This decision requires member states to increase co-operation preventing and investigating terrorism and cross-border crime through a series of measures.  These include the following: member states should maintain a national DNA database and share information from it with other member states; member states should provide legal assistance in collecting and examining samples for DNA in connection with a criminal investigation or with criminal proceedings; member states should also maintain and share data relating to fingerprints and share information relating to vehicle registrations.The Council decision contains other measures to improve police co-operation.  These include provisions requiring member states to share information for the purpose of maintaining public order and security, in connection with major events with a cross-border dimension, and preventing terrorist offences.There are also provisions whereby one member state can afford another member state mutual assistance in connection with the policing of mass gatherings, disasters and serious accidents.  Such assistance will be provided in accordance with a member state's national law governing mutual assistance.  Therefore, it will not supersede the present rules governing the provision of mutual assistance.As the decision is primarily concerned with the exchange of data, there are significant provisions relating to the protection of personal data.  They will ensure data are processed only for the purposes for which they were supplied under the Council decision.  Other data protection provisions deal with such matters as ensuring data are accurate, retained only for as long as necessary for the purpose for which they are supplied and properly protected.  The decision also provides that the data subject's rights are protected and that damages will be available if such rights are violated.The Council decision contains a provision that requires the Council to adopt any measures which are necessary for its effective implementation.  A draft decision has been presented to enable the practical implementation of technical matters relating to the sharing of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data.  This implementing decision is being considered by an expert group.When the advice of the Attorney General on the implications of the Council decision for Irish law was sought, his advice was that primary legislation would be required to implement the data processing and protection provisions.  He also advised that primary legislation would be required to deal with the police co-operation measures.  As I have emphasised throughout, these provisions of the decision are not mandatory.  We can decide that we do not wish to participate in them.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I strongly support this measure which is important in the context of our membership of and participation in the European Union.  We need to provide for the greatest level of co-operation in dealing with crime, including cross-border crime.  It is essential to have the highest level of co-operation, including the exchange of information and data, if we are to tackle criminal gangs engaging in drugs and terrorism offences.   We have a common objective of ensuring those who engage in activity of a serious criminal nature do not find a safe haven in this State or any other EU member state.  We do not have a DNA database in Ireland.  Our legislation has fallen somewhat behind in that regard.  I would have expected, now that we are halfway through the year, that a greater level of progress would have been made in connection with the introduction of this legislation.  I am concerned about the nature of the legislation in question from a human rights perspective.  However, that is not a matter for discussion this evening.  It would not be appropriate for us to enact legislation of the type enacted in the United Kingdom.  I strongly believe in the principle of the exchange of information and the sharing of data.I am in favour of joint patrols, particularly here on the island of Ireland.  Two police forces operate in different parts of the island.  I support the exchange of information and the deployment of joint patrols in cases such as an incident that took place recently in the vicinity of the Vice Chairman's constituency, or the horrific murder of the late Paul Quinn.  The exchange of information and the deployment of joint operations are essential if such crimes are to be detected.I wish the Minister of State well in his deliberations at Council level.  He will have the support of Fine Gael as he discusses the role of cross-border co-operation in combating cross-border crime and terrorism.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Labour Party is also in favour of this proposal.  We look forward to the establishment of a DNA database.  We accept the need for efficient international sharing of data.  What is proposed in respect of the Irish database that has not yet been established?  Is it proposed that it will be a universal database?  If it is to be restricted, how is it proposed that DNA samples will be taken?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has amended the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 to provide that the State will not be entitled to take DNA and biometric information from immigrants.  Is that at odds with the establishment of a national database?  I refer to immigrants who do not have a right to be here but have applied for permission to stay nonetheless.  It is obvious that the provision to which I refer is not discriminatory.  It seems that some issues need to be tidied up.  The amendment made to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 seems to be at odds with the making available of a universal database in Ireland.

Ireland is being asked to sign up to a requirement to do something that has not yet been debated here.  We have not yet set out the parameters of this country's DNA database.  We have not debated the technical aspects of DNA technology.  I refer to low copy numbers, etc.  We should have such a debate.  Society needs to give the Garda the tools it needs.  That is why I suggest this measure is premature.  The development of a new forensic laboratory was put on hold when it was decided that Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park would not be a suitable location for it.  However, a new location has not been suggested and the project has been delayed further.  We should not agree to this proposal until we have had a debate on the type of database we will develop, made a decision on the various biometric indicators which might be saved or stored and considered the various data protection issues in this regard.  I have outlined my objection to this proposal.  If we decide to accept it, we will be rushed into other decisions.  We will be working to somebody else's timetable, rather than our own.  While a case can be made for rushing our work in this regard, there is no case for operating to somebody else's justice agenda.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-04 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Free movement across borders has enabled many criminals to evade justice, which is obviously contrary to what was intended in the first instance.  It is unfortunate that we have fallen behind in our attempts to ensure people do not evade justice by virtue of a system that was intended to be of benefit to the European Union.  This proposal covers many of the concerns raised during the years.  I understand Deputy Ó Snodaigh's concerns.  The Joint Committee on European Scrutiny has reviewed the implementing decision on which this decision is based.  Therefore, the Oireachtas has assessed the type of data that will be collected and the manner in which it will be disseminated to other member states.  I have mentioned that primary legislation will be required, which means that Deputies and Senators will have another opportunity to ventilate their concerns about these issues.  The data-sharing measures will not take effect until every member state has incorporated into its law at least the minimum data protection measures set out in the Council decision.  That will ensure the concerns expressed by Deputies O'Shea and Ó Snodaigh will be dealt with before there are any injustices.
