#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	The Minister is aware that the authorities in the United Kingdom intend to introduce a charge for heavy goods vehicles travelling from outside the state and they have managed to find a methodology for doing so in a manner that does not breach European Union competition law. I understand the Minister's Department has been aware of this for the past three years. He will be aware also that the impact on owners of heavy goods vehicles in this State will be significant. The expectation is that it will render it quite difficult to compete with trucks travelling from the North of Ireland, and particularly the UK.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Under EU legislation, it is open to any member state to introduce road user charges if it wishes. Road charging is an important option for the funding of roads infrastructure, particularly in the context of ensuring that out-of-state hauliers contribute to the costs of a country’s road infrastructure. The new UK road user levy introduces a charge on all HGVs weighing 12 tonnes or more for use of UK roads, including those in Northern Ireland. This levy is planned to start on 1 April 2014. I have expressed my concerns about the impact this levy will have on Irish hauliers to my UK and Northern Ireland colleagues. Furthermore, I have sought exemptions for some roads in Northern Ireland to reduce the impact on Irish hauliers. The issue has also been discussed at transport sectoral meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh.  I will be meeting Mr. Stephen Hammond, MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, on Thursday and I intend to raise this issue directly with him again. Following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I have established a cross-departmental working group to examine the feasibility of introducing a road charging scheme for HGVs in the medium term.  The group began its work in January and is due to report by the middle of this year. The development of a road charging scheme for HGVs is one of my priorities for 2014. Obviously, the introduction of any such regime raises a number of issues and will require input from a wide variety of Departments and agencies.  These issues include the Exchequer impact of a road charging scheme, how it would work, the effect it would have on imports and exports, the technology involved in such a system, compliance with European legislation and how the system would be enforced.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister but he has not given me any confidence that he will find a solution or a resolution that will meet the concerns and the needs of the owners of heavy goods vehicles. He is aware that it is approximately €5,200 cheaper to operate the same heavy goods vehicle in the North of Ireland as opposed to the South. The Irish State has chosen not to police the visiting of Northern trucks in the State in a manner that would make it difficult for them to compete effectively against their Southern counterparts.Trucks travelling from County Donegal to Dublin on a daily basis will incur this charge. I am interested to find out the routes that the Minister has sought to exclude from charges. This initiative will be helpful if it is successful. He also indicated that he has discussed the matter with his counterparts in the North and the UK. Has he taken the opportunity to have a conversation with the leader of Sinn Féin in this House, Deputy Adams, given that he holds significant sway in the Administration in the Northern part of this country? Perhaps a discussion between Deputy Adams and the Minister would help to resolve this matter. I have every expectation that Deputy Adams and Sinn Féin will support the Minister in addressing the concerns of hauliers on this side of the Border. If he has not had that conversation, why has he not done so and will he agree to enter discussions at the earliest opportunity?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	A number of issues should be borne in mind. At the end of last year, 307,849 goods vehicles were registered for tax in Ireland but only 9,500 of these were heavier than 12 tonnes. This charge will only apply to approximately 3% of Irish registered goods vehicles, therefore, although that is still a significant number. Britain has decided to introduce a relatively old-fashioned and time based system whereby out-of-state hauliers purchase tags on a daily basis. Most countries are opting for a distance based system, with some using GPS to measure distances travelled. We have to decide which option we want to take. The countries which have introduced charges generally have a considerable amount of through traffic, such as Austria. These countries want to capture revenue from hauliers passing through. That issue does not really arise for us because most hauliers in Ireland are delivering here. Furthermore, under European law we cannot levy tolls and road charges at the same time. With two minor exceptions, there are no tolls in the United Kingdom but Ireland levies tolls. That must also be addressed.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	The Minister may not have had time to answer my question regarding whether he has had an opportunity to discuss with Deputy Adams the expected approach of the Northern Ireland Assembly to the charge. If he has had such discussions, perhaps he can outline their nature and, if he has not, I ask him to explain why he has not engaged.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	We have more or less agreed that two roads straddling the Border will be exempt. I would also like to exempt the A5 for exactly the reasons identified by Deputy Dooley, namely, because through traffic from the northern part of County Donegal travels through Northern Ireland along that road. I will be raising that issue with my UK counterpart in London on Thursday. I have not discussed the issue with the leader of Sinn Féin but I have raised it with the Northern Ireland Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy, MLA, and the Minister for the Environment, Mark H. Durkan, MLA. As they are the line Ministers for transport and the environment, it makes sense that I have discussions with them rather than a Member of this House. However, it is worth noting this is a UK competence and, irrespective of how much sympathy the Northern Ireland Executive may have for us, this decision is being made in London on a UK basis. I am not sure of the extent to which Deputy Adams has the ears of Conservative Party Ministers in London.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Responsibility for policy on national heritage sites rests with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, while the Office of Public Works is responsible for day-to-day matters, including investment, management and maintenance. Nonetheless, my Department and the tourism agencies recognise that these sites are an important part of our tourism offering.  In that context, significant amounts of the overall funding for tourism capital investment has been allocated in recent years to projects that optimise the tourism potential of such sites.  These allocations have also included heritage sites not in the hands of the OPW, including other publicly-owned properties. The Government's medium-term Exchequer framework for 2012 to 2016 includes provision for significant investment in tourism product development, in recognition of the contribution that capital investment in tourism can make to increasing visitor numbers in the medium term and to sustaining economic recovery. The allocation of funding to specific tourism capital investment projects is the responsibility of Fáilte Ireland, which operates the tourism capital investment programme, and final decisions in this regard are made by the Fáilte Ireland Authority. Significant projects already funded or allocated under the programme in the area of built heritage include Derrynane House, Killarney House, King John's Castle, Russborough House, Castletown House, Garnish Island, Spike Island, Waterford Viking Triangle, the Dubline heritage mile, and the Kilkenny Medieval Mile, as well as a range of other investments. Fáilte Ireland has worked closely with the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, local authorities and other promoters in the development of these projects. Given the level of commitments, there is little scope for any additional project approvals between now and the end of 2016, as the existing capital allocations will be required to fund these and other developments.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Minister of State for his answer. Tourism continues to play an important role in our economy. It is our heritage and plays a role in linking the Irish diaspora with our country. That is the big attraction. In 2011, Ireland was voted the world's favourite holiday destination by readers of Frommer's guide. Lonely Planet listed Ireland as the world's friendliest country and Cork city as one of the top ten cities in the world, and the Irish Tourist Board's website, discoverireland.com, was named the best tourist board website in the world. Will the Minister give a guarantee today that there will be a clear focus on and investment in the upgrading of national heritage sites to make them attractive to the domestic and international tourist market, and will he commit to a joined-up approach with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Fáilte Ireland to attract tourists back to Ireland?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	We appreciate the point, and that is why Fáilte Ireland, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the OPW and all the agencies work together. Deputy McLellan is quite correct. We have proven the point in the past year, with a 7.2% increase in tourism. It has been phenomenal - the best increase since 2008, and from North America the best increase ever. Last year we received the most visitors from America ever and that, in itself, is an achievement. That is why Fáilte Ireland has put the investment into Derrynane House in Kerry, Garnish Island in Cork and Killarney House in Kerry. As the Deputy will be aware, Fáilte Ireland makes the decisions on this funding. I am glad to see the spread of this funding, particularly for heritage sites all over the country, because many thousands of visitors who come into this country want to get the location of these sites to visit and it is important that the OPW, Fáilte Ireland and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht work together with the State agencies to ensure we keep this product at the top of the list.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	A ten-year review of the Irish tourism sector in 2003 predicted that 10 million visitors would visit Ireland on an annual basis by this year. On 11 September 2011, the Department launched a wide-ranging review of Ireland's tourism policy. Views were requested by Friday, 1 November. This report is important for the future of the tourism sector. Does the Minister agree that the figure of ten million visitors can be achieved within five years if there is a supportive policy environment, a clear business strategy and appropriate investment in the tourism sector?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Deputy McLellan is quite correct. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I attended a number of public meetings throughout the country, where we met all of the stakeholders. We covered much of the country and then we held a meeting in Dublin with all the State agencies. I am confident about this report. We had Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and State agencies doing it, but this will be the first time there will be a policy from Government. We are currently going through the submissions and I thank and compliment all who made them. No doubt there is a great interest in tourism in this country. For example, thousands turned out in the middle of winter to support us in The Gathering and hundreds turned out for the meetings we held all over the country. Even last week, it was the same with the Wild Atlantic Way. Hundreds are turning up to meetings all over the country because they are interested in tourism and know that jobs can be created.We set a target for The Gathering and achieved it. We brought communities and local authorities with us for The Gathering. People now realise, as does the Government, the importance of retaining the 9% VAT rate. That is why we put such funding into tourism. Last year alone we created 14,500 extra jobs in the tourism sector. It is all about bringing visitor numbers into the country, thus creating badly needed jobs. We will continue to do that. When we have this report we will publish it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Deputy Clare Daly has informed me that she has had to leave the Chamber, but will be back soon. I propose that we proceed to the next Question No. 92. I call Deputy Dooley to introduce it.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The Minister is aware that SIPTU members at Aer Lingus and at three State airports have voted for industrial action up to and including strike action. The threat of strike action can have a damaging impact on our tourism industry. It affects sentiment towards Ireland and discourages people who might be looking at Ireland as a possible holiday destination. What action does the Minister propose to take to try to resolve the threat that now exists as a result of the SIPTU vote? The Minister is well aware that the situation relates to the Irish airlines superannuation scheme.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	A resolution of the funding difficulties in the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, where there is currently a substantial and unsustainable deficit of over €700 million, is a matter for the trustees, the companies participating in the scheme, the members and the pensions board. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have continually encouraged all parties to continue to use the State’s labour relations machinery to resolve these difficulties. For some time, all parties have participated in discussions with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to identify solutions. In May of last year, the Labour Court issued recommendations on the matter, including separate recommendations in relation to both Aer Lingus and DAA. A range of meetings involving the parties have taken place since then. While I appreciate the frustration of staff in the companies, and indeed that of the employers, industrial action in DAA or Aer Lingus will not help to achieve a solution. It will, however, severely inconvenience passengers, including tourists and business travellers.  It will also adversely impact on the financial position of the companies who are being asked to contribute more to solve the problem. A strike will obviously make it harder for them to do so, as it will have an affect on their profits.  On behalf of the Government, I appeal to all concerned to reflect carefully on the negative implications of proceeding with any disruptive industrial action. A resolution must be found. The trustees have recently published revised proposals to address the deficit in the IASS. They only did that a few days ago. I welcome this initiative as I believe it will assist the parties to refocus on the search for sustainable compromise solutions to the funding problems in the scheme. I urge all parties to re-engage on the basis of these new proposals, using the State’s labour relations machinery which is available to them.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	Yet again, the Minister is pleading the position of the hurler on the ditch. He rightly identified the involvement of the trustees, the pension board, the members and others. He also has some advice for them and is encouraging them to use the good offices of the State's industrial relations machinery. In addition, he has set out the case regarding the impact of such a strike. The only matter the Minister neglected to identify is that the State is the only shareholder in the three State airports, which is a significant component of the entire pension fund. In addition, the Minister is a significant shareholder in Aer Lingus. I, therefore, do not accept his position that he is somehow a casual observer standing on the ditch. His role is far more involved than that. I would like to see him taking a more proactive role in trying to broker a solution to this crisis. The sooner the Minister involves himself, the sooner we can bring about a resolution.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	As the Deputy says, the State is the sole shareholder in DAA and Shannon, as well as being a minority shareholder in Aer Lingus. There is a further employee SRT which no longer exists, as the Deputy will be aware. I would not like the Deputy to think, however, that I am disengaged from this; I certainly am not. I have had meetings with the companies at the highest level and meetings with the unions. In addition, my officials have met with the trustees on several occasions, together with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, who also has some semi-State pension issues within his remit.I met the Pensions Board; therefore, it is not the case that I am an aloof observer. It is something about which I am concerned. However, it is not in my gift to impose a solution. This is not a public pension fund and is not controlled by the State; rather it is a pension fund made up of its members and I am not in a position to impose a solution. However, the offices of the State are available to assist those involved in brokering a solution. At this stage this is best done by the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. It is a big problem, with the deficit now over €700 million. It was approximately €300 million two years ago and the failure to deal with it has made the position much worse. It is getting worse because the benefits being drawn from it are greater than the contributions being made. The basis of the solution lies in this.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I accept the bona fides of the Minister and do not doubt he is involved in discussions with the various actors, but it requires more than this. As the significant shareholder, he is required to bring forward a more comprehensive funding solution. There are many issues with the pension fund. Employees transferred from the Department to work at Shannon Airport in 1969 and 1970 and the commitments given to them at the time were not and still have not been honoured. I will deal with that issue through a Private Members' Bill or by an amendment to legislation pertaining to the promised amalgamation of Shannon Airport and Shannon Development. There have been problems with the pension fund for quite some time and it requires more direct action by the Government through the Minister. I would welcome him considering bringing forward a more comprehensive funding solution to meet the needs of the workers, the people who have retired and those with deferred pension expectations.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	The Deputy is correct. There have been problems with the pension fund for a very long time, for longer than I have been in office, and I am determined to ensure the issue is resolved under my watch. I want to make sure people receive their pensions and that we do not face disruption at the airports. I must also protect the taxpayer as any contribution from the companies into the pension fund is an indirect transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to the pensioners and the members of the pension fund, many of whom are better off than the average taxpayer. This must also be borne in mind. In the view of the Pensions Board it is a defined benefit pension fund and, as is the case with many other semi-State pension funds, the only way to address the problem is through the company putting in more and the beneficiaries accepting that they will not receive the benefits they had expected or that had been promised. That is how all other deficits such as this have been dealt with and I am sure that is where the solution will lie.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	We will now return to Question No. 91 in the name of Deputy Clare Daly.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	The question is about the Irish air accident investigation unit's investigation into the Manx2 accident in Cork, particularly the lessons that have been learned from the analysis. The report identifies concerns about the lack of regulation in the aviation sector in Europe. I wonder what lessons the Department has drawn from it in an Irish context.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I thank the Deputy for the question. As the third anniversary of the tragic accident at Cork Airport has just passed, I extend my deepest sympathy to the relatives of the six passengers and air crew who lost their lives and the six passengers who were injured. The investigation into this accident was conducted by the air accident investigation unit of my Department and I commend the work of the investigation team in producing a very comprehensive report.  The team put an enormous amount of work into it in the past few years and has done a sterling job in its report. The operator of the aircraft involved in the crash at Cork Airport was licensed in Spain and responsibility for safety oversight of its operations rested with the Spanish regulatory authorities under EU law.  In Ireland the Irish Aviation Authority has statutory responsibility for overseeing safety standards of civil aviation in the State, including airlines and crew members licensed in Ireland and aircraft registered here.  The AAIU report on the Cork Airport crash made 11 safety recommendations. These were addressed to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO; the European Commission, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the Spanish civil aviation authority and the Spanish operator of the aircraft involved.None of the safety recommendations was directed to an Irish agency.  It is important that all of the safety recommendations made in the report are addressed by the organisations concerned. Ireland has an excellent record and reputation in aviation safety and the report does not bring this into question.  The IAA regulates the sector on the basis of international standards set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, and on the basis of EU regulations.  It is audited regularly by both the European Aviation Safety Agency and ICAO.  These audits ensure that the IAA operates to the highest standards, and I have every confidence in the IAA's effectiveness in ensuring that Irish aviation is and will continue to be one of the safest in the world.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	As the Minister indicated, there was much work put into this incredibly comprehensive report which identified the lack of regulation that existed in Spain. It also pinpointed a very complex arrangement of companies with apparent responsibility for operating the aircraft, as well as the circumstances under which some of the crew had to operate. The Minister is aware that some of the contributing factors were the tiredness of flight crew and the inadequate oversight of remote operation by the operator and the state. In an Irish context, who oversees such issues? There are airline staff operating under contracts of employment that may be zero-hour contracts; some contract pilots must fly to earn money. That would incentivise these people to report for duty even if they are sick or under stress. Who regulates similar contracts as applied in the Manx crash in an Irish context?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	It is important to reiterate that no recommendations were made to Irish authorities or bodies at all, and I would not like to see people bringing Irish industrial relations issues into what was a really tragic incident for which Irish authorities had no responsibility. The purpose of this and any associated investigation is not to apportion blame or liability. A safety recommendation in no case shall create a presumption of blame or liability for an occurrence. A number of entities had safety recommendations made to them, which I mentioned, and under EU law they are required to respond to them within 90 days. We expect them to do so. There were four recommendations made to the European Commission regarding flight time limitations, to which the Deputy referred; the role of the ticket seller; the improvement of safety oversight; and the oversight of operating licences, which relates to virtual airlines. Three recommendations were made to the European Aviation Safety Agency relating to successive instrument approaches that can be conducted in certain meteorological conditions; the syllabus for the appointment of the commander; and the process by which the air operator certificate is granted. Two recommendations were made to the operator, Flightline SL, regarding its operational policy and training. One recommendation was made to the Spanish agency regarding the oversight of air carriers such as the one in question. One recommendation was made to ICAO regarding the inclusion of the approach and the capability of aircraft, flight crew and plans. It is fair to say that everything from instrumental issues to training and flight time limitations are addressed in the report. In each case, recommendations were made to the appropriate bodies, none of which was Irish.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	The Minister is correct that none of them is Irish, and it is an incredibly comprehensive report which is not about blame but very much about learning lessons. The complex arrangement and crew conditions were identified as a contributing factor to this tragic accident, as the Minister has indicated. I am not interested in blaming anybody. In an Irish context, does the Irish Aviation Authority or somebody else oversee the contracts of flight crew in Ireland? There have been reports of some Norwegian companies seeking air operator certificates from Ireland and using this State as a flag of convenience in that regard. In such a context, is the IAA responsible for overseeing the contracts of flight crew?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	That depends on circumstances and there are variations from case to case. In this case it was not the IAA but rather the Spanish authorities that were responsible.The Irish Aviation Authority is responsible for regulating Aer Lingus and Ryanair. There are some exceptions, however, because IASA and the ICAO have a role also. The entire sector is governed by international conventions and European laws. Norwegian has already been granted a licence to operate from Ireland. It intends to establish a real operation in Swords, a town with which the Deputy is familiar. It is to be a very big investment. The company intends to base its transatlantic services in Ireland and they will be subject to the exact same safety regulations as Aer Lingus and Ryanair. The Deputy will agree that both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have excellent safety records that are among the best in the world. In addition, Norwegian will be bound by all the labour regulations that apply in all parts of the European Union.

I wish to ensure security and stability for those who are currently working there and the companies that have invested in it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	As the Deputy is aware, Dublin Port Company is responsible for the State’s largest port and handles over 40% of the total tonnage in any given year at Irish ports. The company’s importance is recognised in the national ports policy, which designates the company as a tier 1 port of national significance and includes the continued commercial development of the company as a key strategic objective. The company has published a master plan, which is available on its website and outlines its view of the challenges and opportunities for the period 2012 to 2040. As the Deputy states, there is a proposed regulation on port services and the financial transparency of ports, published by the European Commission in late May 2013 and currently under consideration by the European Parliament’s transport committee and also by member state officials at Council level. My Department published a regulatory impact analysis in August 2013 outlining the regulation’s proposals and circulated it among the relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. My Department's analysis, supported by submissions received during the consultation period, was that the proposed regulation would have little impact on how port services are provided in Irish ports. As part of my Department's consultations, no specific or general concerns were raised about the impact of this proposed directive on union involvement or worker participation in Irish ports; nor have any such concerns been raised in response to the national ports policy, published in 2013. In late November 2013, the Competition Authority published its review of competition within the ports sector This report states that competition is working well in some areas, but the authority makes a number of recommendations for consideration that it believes will further improve competition in the sector. In regard to Dublin Port specifically, the Competition Authority has made two specific recommendations. As stated in National Ports Policy, I am committed to issuing a reasoned response to the Competition Authority’s recommendations within six months of the publication of the report. The company recently published on its website a franchise review consultation document that outlines its views on the future management of port service operations within the port, which my officials are considering.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	Those who favour competition will say it will lead to more jobs and growth, whereas those considering liberalisation will say it could result in job losses and a deterioration in working conditions. There is a fear that profitability margins dictating policy and procedure will have negative effects on those companies that have been working at the port over the years and which have invested heavily therein. The issue of the workers also arises. I am from a dockland community and know the way in which workers' rights, conditions, health and safety and a proper working wage have been fought for and negotiated down through the years. I can remember a family who were involved in the button system and all the abuses that occurred at that stage. I acknowledge the work of some of the unions, particularly that of the Marine, Port and General Workers' Union under the late Jimmy Dunne. There are fears. The Competition Authority is pushing for more licenses. This will bring in other companies that could bring in workers at the minimum wage or lower. How can the traditional companies and traditional dockland families who have been doing their jobs year after year and handing down the tradition compete with that? The wages and conditions of those in this group are seriously compromised, as could be health and safety.

Effectively, the port is now a landlord and estate management company. The terminals are operated by three different private companies, all of which are competing with one another. I am satisfied with the level of internal competition in the port. I do not recognise any major need for increased competition at the port, although I acknowledge that the Competition Authority makes some valid points about the length of leases. In some cases, they are very long. The authority's view is that leases for as long as 90 years are inappropriate.At the same time, we all know about property rights and I suspect it would be very hard to untangle those leases. Even when it comes to issuing more licences, and the port is open to doing that, one would have to ask where those additional people would base themselves on the port estate. I do not know how that will work out. As regards the national ports policy, I refer to the view of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on our national ports policy, which is the Government's policy, not the Competition Authority's report, which is a different thing. It states that ICTU welcomes the broad thrust of the policy. With regard to the regulation to which the Deputy referred, ICTU says its understands that this regulation is now under active consideration. It says that it has studied the proposed regulation and at this point does not see any policy emerging that is likely to result in the requirement to fundamentally change the organisation of the ports in the Republic of Ireland. It has asked the European Transport Workers' Federation to keep it up to speed on any emerging developments so that it might offer a further view on this matter. We remain engaged with ICTU on this issue. There is no agenda from the Government to drive down terms and conditions or wages at the port.

The other aspect is its engagement with a dockers' museum, which I hope will be realised. It has been very supportive of it. However, is there a strong role for Dublin Port and for the Minister in the EU social dialogue committee, which was established last June?

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	Will the Minister provide an update on the proposed bid for the Rugby World Cup?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 108 and 850 together. Last November, the Government considered a memorandum on the discussions and analysis to date on a potential bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023. While the memorandum identified a number of challenges, the great potential of the event is also clear and I believe that hosting the Rugby World Cup on a cross-Border basis in 2023 would be a great opportunity for Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Aside from the potential economic boost, the tournament would raise our international profile, not just in terms of sport and tourism but also more widely in terms of business, trade and investment.  Attracting major international events is a key element of tourism strategy on both sides of the Border and co-operation between North and South can enhance such events. In response to the memorandum, the Government expressed strong support for the proposal and for the conduct of further work to get to the stage of making a formal decision to bid.  To progress the matter further, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I met with Arlene Foster, MLA, the Minister responsible for tourism in the Northern Ireland Executive, and Carál Ní Chulín, MLA, who is responsible for sport in the Northern Ireland Executive, in Armagh on 22 January. At that meeting, we agreed to establish a working group to examine some key issues further and to report back to Ministers in the summer.  The working group will hold its first meeting next Tuesday, 25 February.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I am sure the Minister and the House will join me in wishing the Irish rugby team every success this weekend, when it travels to Twickenham to face England in the RBS 6 Nations Championship. Hosting the Rugby World Cup is a very exciting prospect for this country, not just for rugby fans but for everybody. The country, North and South, can benefit from it in the many years leading up to the games and for many years after them. It is important that when we put the bid together we invest the appropriate time and money in it. It is akin to a bid to host the Olympic Games. Will the Minister make additional funding available for rugby and for hosting the Rugby World Cup, in particular through the sports capital grant programme? Who is on the working group? What bodies are represented on it? Who will chair the working group?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I agree with the Deputy that this would be a great opportunity for the country. With regard to the sports capital programme and the funding we provide each year to rugby in this country, we were delighted this year to be able to keep our funding to the Irish Sports Council intact. I was delighted that rugby got its fair share of the national cake.Tomorrow meetings will take place in Belfast between those involved, North and South, and an announcement will be made on who will chair the committee. The chairman will be independent and I am pleased that he has accepted the position. Out of respect to our colleagues in Northern Ireland, we will have to wait until tomorrow to announce who the chairman is, but people will be pleased as he is a person of stature who will do an excellent job for the country. A number of issues will have to be examined. The Deputy asked whether funding would be required to put the bid together. That is one of the issues that will have to be discussed; as well as how much funding will come from the North and how much will come from the South and how much money will be required to put a bid together. These are some of the issues the committee will examine.

It is a demonstration of how sport unifies, North and South. In addition to the IRFU, other sports bodies such as the GAA will be involved. Twenty or 40 years ago that would not have been possible. Will the committee be composed of representatives of the IRFU and other sports bodies or will it be composed of individuals from other countries who have been involved in bids in the past? I presume the IRFU will make the application with the support of the Government. When will the application be made?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The Deputy is correct - sport is something that brings everyone together. During the past five years of the serious economic downturn sport was the one thing that lifted the souls, minds and spirits of the people. I thank the GAA for making its facilities available because the bid could not happen if it did not do so. There will be representatives of both Governments, North and South, on the working group. There will also be representatives of the three tourism agencies and the IRFU. The composition of the committee is one of the issues that must be discussed. A roadmap will be drawn up of how the bid will be put together. We must decide whether to set up a company and whether the IRFU or the Government will make the bid. That is the point of setting up the committee. Two representatives of the IRFU will be involved. They must be present because we will depend on them to support us with the bid. I have outlined the purpose of the committee, which is to draw up a roadmap and plan the cost and the funding required from the North and the South. The committee will report back to both Ministers before the summer and many other issues will arise along the way. When the report is handed to the Government, we will then make a decision on it.

Will the proposed bid be a joint one by the IRFU in conjunction with another body? Will the Minister of State indicate the extent to which all of the history of rugby in this country might be used as a means to ensure the attractiveness of the various locations in this jurisdiction? By the same token, is it possible for him to indicate the extent to which other sports events of a similar international flavour might be used as a means of attracting tourists to the country in the coming years?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	Part of the Deputy’s question is related to what the bid for the Rugby World Cup will do for the country, in particular in terms of tourism. There is no doubt that this is one of the events we could stage. Deputy John O’Mahony has referred to the GAA which will also be involved in the committee. This is an opportunity on which the country cannot pass and I hope we can make a bid, but many stumbling blocks will be encountered along the way. Decisions will have to be made on how much the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive can invest in the process. We have an opportunity to show the world that we can host a major international event such as the Rugby World Cup. It will also show how capable the business community is in this country.The reason we have so many multinational companies is that they know we can do what is required. We have educated people to staff them and we are able to turn around and do whatever is required. I have no doubt this opportunity should not be lost. We will have to wait for the working group to report back to us, and tomorrow we will announce the chairperson of the group. People will be happy with the chairperson, who is of major prominence and very much involved in business. He will be able to bring it together and do a good job for us.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	What are the Minister's views on whether local authorities should have greater discretion on spending on local and regional roads?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 99 together. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on these roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded from this additional funding is also a matter for the local authority concerned. Last month, I announced that a total of €331.9 million would be provided to local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2014. I will give local authorities significantly increased flexibility this year. I have reduced the number of grant categories, increased the amount allocated under the discretionary grant heading and will facilitate the transfer of funds between key grant categories where local authorities need this. Local authorities can also re-prioritise their road strengthening programme where necessary. In addition, local authorities can use up to 15% of their discretionary grant for the local improvement scheme covering non-public roads. In making adjustments to the regional and local road allocations in 2014, my primary aim has been, as far as is practicable, to strike an important balance. On the one hand, local authorities will have more flexibility than ever to target funding to appropriate repair and rehabilitation schemes in local areas. On the other hand, I want to ensure key programmes that promote preventative maintenance and safety projects on public roads continue to be funded. Given funding constraints, the Government's priority has to be to protect previous investment in the road network. In short, we are putting maintenance and repair first. It is also particularly important that local authorities do not reduce expenditure from their own resources on roads this year in view of the current difficult situation, and that they carefully reassess their planned road programmes for 2014 in light of the impact of the recent storms on their road networks. In principle, I intend to give local authorities greater, possibly full, discretion over their spending of State grants for roads in 2015. I believe local authorities and their elected members are best placed to make decisions of where and for what roads funding should be spent in their own county rather than allowing that decision to be made by central government or the Department. This, however, will depend on wider Government consideration of the funding of local authorities and the various sources from which local authorities now receive their funds.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I thank the Minister for his response. His intentions and efforts in this area are very welcome. It is very important local authorities do not reduce their funding for road maintenance or for improvement works where they can happen. It is important to continue to invest in roads through maintaining existing local roads or improving road networks where we can, not only because of the recent weather issues but also in terms of investment and economic stimulus for the country. It is also important that individual local authority members rather than the executive take more responsibility in managing funding and prioritising where the money must go. It is not an unlimited amount of money, and some areas need more investment than others. It is for the individual members of Dublin City Council and other local authorities to make use of the money and they know how best to do it. It is regrettable that the provision to each local authority of 80% of the funding from the local property tax raised in its area is not being maintained. We need to put this commitment back in place on a statutory basis for 2015 so that future Governments will not be able to reverse it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	While no definite decision has yet been made on this, next year I would like to make a block grant to each local authority and leave it up to them to decide how they want to allocate it. If we are serious about local government, this is what we should be doing. As I pointed out earlier, this is only one source of funds that local authorities can use to improve roads. They can also use money from commercial rates. It is intended that next year 80% of the local property tax will go to the local authorities concerned, and this can be increased or decreased by up to 15%.The Government is moving towards much greater discretion on the part of local authorities in how they raise and spend money on local and regional roads, which is what local government should be all about. As Deputy Eoghan Murphy will be aware, the local property tax is really a matter for the Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Community and Local Government. However, I am of a similar view to the Deputy, that we should ensure the aforementioned 80% commitment will be honoured in 2015 and that the money will stay at a local level and be spent locally.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	Recent questions to the Minister for Defence have revealed that almost once a day on average the Defence Forces are called out to back up the Garda Síochána at Shannon Airport. What does the Minister think of this, given that not one single US aircraft has been searched? Is this not somewhat mad and does it not undermine the viability of Shannon as a commercial airport?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	The Shannon Airport Authority, SAA, has statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop Shannon Airport. I have no involvement in matters affecting its commercial operations. Primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, rests with An Garda Síochána. When requested to so do, in what is referred to as aid to the civil power, ATCP, the Defence Forces may assist An Garda Síochána in carrying out some of its functions. I understand from the Department of Defence which has responsibility for this matter that the Defence Forces have provided assistance for An Garda Síochána at Shannon Airport on occasion. The SAA advises that every effort is made to ensure any disturbance, including those requiring the assistance of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, does not affect its operations. Citizens have the right to assemble and protest peacefully at Shannon Airport and An Garda Síochána will facilitate such gatherings on occasion. In this regard, organisers of peaceful protest events should liaise with local gardaí beforehand. However, if protesters do not abide by the laws of the land and engage in criminal activities or public order offences, the Garda and the Defence Forces, if necessary, must intervene to the extent necessary to protect the operation of the airport, its user airlines and the travelling public.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	Although the Minister uses the term "on occasion", on average it is approximately once a day. Does he not think it is an incredible irony that legislation is used against protesters and yet not one single US aeroplane has been searched by the relevant authorities? He also speaks about the airport's commercial viability not being undermined, but is it not strange that a 79 year old woman with impaired mobility was able to access the runway together with a colleague? Not only did she occupy the runway but she was obliged to telephone from it to alert the aviation authorities that they had been on the runway for approximately half an hour and that their presence had not been noticed. If that is not peculiar, I do not know what is. Shannon Airport has been operating almost as a 51st state of the Union in facilitating the US military. The Minister will be aware that the United Nations Committee Against Torture asked the Government recently to account for its actions in the use of Shannon Airport. What is he doing in this regard?

The number of occasions on which the Defence Forces have been called on to aid the civil power has increased in recent years, at a cost of €250,000 per year to the taxpayer. However, the number of munitions of war civilian flights landing at Shannon Airport fell significantly from 1,149 in 2011 to 349 last year. While the number of military flights at Shannon Airport has fallen by more than two thirds in two years, the number of protests and incidents requiring the Defence Forces to be called has increased. There is a story to be told in that regard. I hope the Deputy will agree with me and state in this House that while all Members respect and recognise the right of people to engage in peaceful protest, no one should risk his or her life or the lives of others in engaging in incursions on the runway.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I do not agree with the Minister. For the Official Report, I note that citizens have an international obligation to speak out about wrongdoing and what has gone on in respect of the US military war machine.Citizens such as Margaretta D'Arcy are to be complimented on sacrificing themselves for the greater good by speaking out against that injustice and the use of Shannon Airport for rendition flights. The authorities are too lax in using the legislation we have to have a go at the military aircraft that are using our facility, but much too harsh on citizens who are speaking out for peace.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	No action has been taken under Article 16 provisions of the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation on the searching of planes suspected of involvement in renditions, troops or arms transportation. While the Chicago Convention applies to civil rather than military aircraft, the US has on several occasions commissioned private companies for the transport of troops and arms and to conduct rendition operations. In 2006, Amnesty International highlighted the fact the CIA was hiring civilian aircraft for military purposes to bypass the legislation and regulations in Shannon Airport. Does the Government have any intention of addressing this? Does the Minister not think it is a bit outrageous that a 79-year-old woman, Margaretta D'Arcy, has to go on the runway to highlight the fact that the Government is not doing what it is supposed to do?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The power to search aircraft lies with the Garda, so that is a matter that either Deputy can take up with the Minister for Justice and Equality. They engage with him regularly in Dáil debates so perhaps they can add that to the list of complaints they want to raise with him.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	What gave the Minister that impression?

It seems she actually thinks it is to be encouraged for somebody to go out on a runway, sacrifice his or her life and maybe even cause the deaths of other people to make some political protest. I find it very disturbing that she would see it as some sort of blood sacrifice that an elderly lady should offer up her life and potentially threaten the lives of others at Shannon.

We have made no commitments for any project beyond 2016 in any part of the island. At the meeting, the council noted that following the court judicial review ruling on 8 April 2013, work is progressing on an appropriate assessment process, which will be the subject of a public consultation exercise that is expected to take place this spring. I and my Northern counterparts have agreed that once the environmental reviews are completed and the position with regard to the project programme has been clarified, updated programme milestones will need to be prepared for agreement by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, taking account of financial commitments that are in place.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	Can the Minister elaborate on the likely timeline for the completion of that planning process? Could the Minister outline his understanding of where the Northern Ireland Administration is regarding its funding for this project? Before the last election and the planning problems that have arisen there was a commitment from both Governments to co-fund this project. There have been planning issues since than and a change in the funding commitment from the Irish Government, moving from a co-funding commitment to what the Minister just outlined - that is, €25 million in 2015 and again in 2016. However, the Northern Ireland Government indicated that it would continue with the project and do two particular stretches of it. There was time-specific funding from Westminster to the Northern Ireland Executive flowing from the funding commitment given in the St. Andrews Agreement. Planning issues have delayed the spending of that money this year.Will the Minister update us on the position regarding that funding at the Northern Ireland level? Is it his understanding that the commitment remains, or is there an agreement in place to ensure the money that has been specifically allocated will remain available?

It will take however long it takes to get planning permission for the road. I cannot speak on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive when it comes to its funding commitments. However, as far as the Government is concerned, we have renewed and reiterated our commitment to contribute £25 million in 2015 and the same again in 2016. To date, we have already committed €22 million for a road that has not yet been started, which is a little frustrating. I hope planning permission is given for this road. I would hate to see us allocate £25 million in 2015 and for that not to be drawn down because of the lack of planning permission. We cannot really make allocations or commitments until the road has planning permission. If this was a house, a factory or a school, we would not be making financial commitments until planning permission was granted. The road does not have planning permission at this stage and if the project does get planning permission, it may look very different from the project we are talking about now.

There was clarity on the funding commitment in the past; the project was to be co-funded. The Government is now three years into its term and next year the first £25 million it has committed to the project is due to be allocated. Hopefully the planning permission is in place for that. The Minister has indicated that there will be a further £25 million for the following year as well. We are only two years away from the end of that period. Will the Minister give us an update on the Government's commitment after that date in terms of what it will give towards the project? Also, I urge the Minister to engage closely with the Northern Ireland Executive, because we are very much dependent on it to progress this project with the specific funding it had allocated towards it. It is key that the Minister be part of that. I know this is primarily a responsibility for the Executive, but what will happen the ring-fenced funding that was supposed to be spent on the road this year but was not spent due to the planning issues? This funding is critical to seeing the project built. The £50 million we have committed will not be sufficient to build the road, even with the level of funding the Northern Ireland Executive has. Will the Minister elaborate on our Government's long term commitment funding-wise?

This is true in the case of the DART underground, the metro north, the bus rapid transit project and just about every other road project around the country. The only commitments we have made are up to 2016, except where a contract has already been signed or in the case of an advanced project. The project in question here is a proposed project and does not even have planning permission. We do not know what the project will look like when it finally gets permission. For any project like this, in any part of the island, we have not yet made commitments for 2017 or 2018. We will do that as part of the preparation of a new national development plan to replace the existing plan, which expires in 2016, and we will need to start work on that quite soon.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 797 together. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road schemes is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities. The main purpose of the Roads Bill 2014, which is currently at Second Stage in the Dáil, is to facilitate the merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency. The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to the existing provisions of the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007. At present there is no provision in either the Roads Acts or the Planning Acts for the NRA or road authorities to enter into pre-planning-application consultations with An Bord Pleanála on proposed road developments. However, the Planning Acts make provision for pre-planning consultation in regard to various other strategic infrastructure developments, including transport-related projects, with An Bord Pleanála prior to the submission of a planning application. I believe there is merit to the Deputy's suggestion, which has arisen from our discussions of the future of the Adare bypass.It makes little sense to me, for example, that the promoters of the Luas can engage in preplanning consultations with An Bord Pleanála but the relevant roads authority cannot do so for a new road. Therefore, if the Deputy wishes to bring forward such an amendment to the Roads Bill on Committee Stage, I am open to accepting it. Alternatively, I will seek to introduce such an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage. However, as preplanning consultations are a function of An Bord Pleanála and, therefore, primarily a planning matter, this will require close liaision between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and An Bord Pleanála to ensure we all agree on the way forward.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I welcome the Minister's reply. He will agree that it is intolerable that local authorities and regional road design offices work in a vacuum in designing roads for which An Bord Pleanála refuses permission. We saw this happen in Adare and other parts of the country. The problem does not arise only at preplanning consultation stage but when permission is refused by An Bord Pleanála and the board does not engage with the local authority or the road design office, with the result that they continue to work in Limbo and cannot anticipate the problem in a redesign. Vast sums of Exchequer money are rightly going into projects around the country at the design stage and it is essential to engage in preplanning consultation. One would not build a house without engaging in preplanning consultation with one's local authority, but it is expected that one can be allowed to build roads without doing so. I will bring forward an amendment to the Roads Bill. Will the Minister liaise with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in advance of its being taken? I would like to work with the Minister and the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the amendment.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	The Deputy's point is well made. I did not know until I held this job - it does seem very strange - that the RPA could engage in preplanning consultation with An Bord Pleanála on a Luas project but that the NRA could not do so in the case of a road project. It can certainly be done in the case of a factory or other large development. It makes no sense to me and I am not sure why it is so. It is not provided for in legislation. I do not think that necessarily means that it is precluded, but that is the way it is being interpreted. One thing that frustrates Ministers and the public is that very often millions of euro and a great deal of time can be invested in planning road projects which An Bord Pleanála rejects. It would make a great deal of sense to me if one could sit down with An Bord Pleanála to get a steer on what it might find acceptable or have a problem with. If an amendment could be made with the co-operation of my colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and An Bord Pleanála, it could save us a lot of money and wasted time in the future.

I hope the N21 which conveys the bulk of the tourist traffic from Dublin and Shannon Airports to County Kerry and the south west will be prioritised as part of the capital envelope for future NRA work because the situation is intolerable. I will bring forward the amendment the Minister suggested and would like his officials to liaise with me on it.

I know the NRA is considering afresh how the roads around Foynes and Adare could be improved. I have been stuck in Adare on several occasions and it is the major bottleneck on the way to County Kerry. I am very keen to make progress on the issue.

Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The planning, design and implementation of national road projects are matters for the National Roads Authority in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads are the statutory responsibility of each local authority, funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. I understand the preferred route has been selected for the proposed N56 Letterkenny relief road which encompasses the Bonagree relief road. However, given the reduced level of funding available for major schemes such as this, it is not possible to provide any additional funding at this time to enable the scheme to progress further. As regards the N14 Letterkenny to Lifford scheme, I have been advised that Donegal County Council was allocated €300,000 in 2013 to review and update the design of the scheme.  A further €50,000 has been provided in 2014 for the N14-N15 to A5 link element of the scheme to allow for the closing out of the statutory processes. Donegal County Council applied to the Department in 2010 for funding under the specific improvement grants scheme for funds for the Cockhill bridge scheme. The projected cost of the project was €2.95 million. Given the costs associated with the project, it was not possible to approve this application and no further formal funding application has since been received by my Department. Given the need to prioritise funding for repair and strenghtening works, the specific improvement grants scheme has been curtailed in 2014. While provision was made for bridge repair and rehabilitation works in 2014, I understand the Cockhill bridge proposal as submitted in 2010 is outside the scope of such works as it involves major widening works. It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grant aid is to supplement councils' own resource spending on regional and local roads.

As he will no doubt be well aware, local authorities have limited funds and depend to a large extent on the Government to progress projects such as the Cockhill bridge scheme. The funding he provides just about allows local authorities to keep up with maintenance, but specific funds from central government must be allocated for projects such as the one referred to in Buncrana. The problem with this project has been ongoing for many years. It is a project that should have been undertaken in the past, but, equally, it is one that needs to be completed now. I ask the Minister to give me an indication as to when we can expect to see funds provided of the nature needed to ensure for the people of Buncrana a major artery to the Innishowen Peninsula can be provided. Regarding the Letterkenny-Lifford link road, does the Minister see potential in terms of the provision of funding in 2015 and 2016 in respect of that allocated for the A5? Does he envisage some of that funding being spent on improving the Letterkenny to Lifford link road?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	The Deputy is right. Local authorities are strapped for cash but so is central government. The cutback in funding for roads has been dramatic. The cutback in the National Roads Authority's budget is nearly 80% from its peak. This has been done to protect front-line services such as health, education, the Garda and others. As a result, all we are able to do this year, where something is not a public private partnership, is maintenance and repair work. If I get extra money, I can reconsider this but without extra money, I cannot. To give the Deputy an indication of what it means, the amount of money going to Donegal County Council from my Department for the repair and maintenance of roads in the county is €18.5 million which is a lot of money, but if I was to take €3 million from that figure for the bridge he proposes - it would not come from something else - it would amount to a 20% cut in the maintenance budget for the rest of the county. That would not be the right decision for County Donegal. Money is finite and there is no pot of unallocated moneys. If I did put money towards new bridges, I would have to take it from the funding for maintenance works. Therefore, to build this one bridge in County Donegal, we would have to cut the maintenance budget for the entire county by 20%, which would not be a good idea.

In the past two years we have seen it decrease. If he could give an assurance that he would not reduce funding to the level to which it has been cut, he might be in a position to proceed with some of the projects mentioned. I know the national finances are in a difficult position, but, equally, there are significant projects that need to be progressed. It is important that people are given a timeline to allow them to look forward to seeing these projects come to fruition. I ask the Minister to consider providing a fund to deal with specific major infrastructural projects similar to the three I have outlined. It simply cannot be done with the funding he is giving which is essential to maintain the current road network.

The reason we have had to cut back on road spending so much is that the economy crashed under the watch of the Deputy's party.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	The Minister can do better than that.

I cannot do that, but if there are signs in the economy, they are that a slow recovery is under way. I hope that in next year's budget we will see an increase in funding for roads. I cannot guarantee this, but that is what I am fighting for.

The matters raised by Deputies Deputy Peadar Tóibín; Noel Harrington; Michael McNamara; and Dara Calleary and John O'Mahony have been selected for discussion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	Ever since the reports appeared in The Sunday Times on the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, being placed under surveillance, the Government, in particular the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has sought until now to undermine public confidence in GSOC and essentially rubbish the allegations about the alleged surveillance. The Taoiseach told an untruth, deliberately or otherwise, about GSOC's reporting obligations under the legislation to the Government. That very cleverly switched the focus early on from whether the office had been bugged to the reason GSOC had not reported the matter to the Minister. Last Tuesday when he addressing the Dáil, the Minister essentially said, "There is nothing to report here. Please move on," and he withheld vital information given to him by GSOC in written form. If we look at his statement and contrast it with GSOC's document, it is fascinating to note the deliberate omissions by the Minister, matters he should have placed before the Dáil last Tuesday evening. They include, for example, the security company which was brought in to do the sweep stating the level of technology used was only available to government agencies. The Minister did not say this. In regard to threat No. 2, the conference call facility, the likelihood of the threat being benign was so small as to be at virtually zero. Again, this was air-brushed out of the Minister's presentation. Critically, a public interest investigation was launched pursuant to section 102(4) of the Garda Síochána Act of 2005; essentially, as gardaí were suspects in GSOC's perspective, there was, therefore, the invocation of that section of the Act.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	I understand the Government has now decided to set up some form of inquiry, but does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister for Justice and Equality fundamentally withheld very basic and vital information that was in the public interest from the House last Tuesday evening? Is he satisfied with the Minister's behaviour in this entire episode?

However, the point is that in regard to the responsibility of GSOC which is to oversee the Garda Síochána, when GSOC initiates a public investigation into a matter of public interest, it can only be about the Garda.In that sense, section 103 states that the commission shall provide the Minister with information regarding what it has done. GSOC has dealt with that issue. The commission stated that it considered the decision to be very difficult, it chose not to inform the Minister at the time and it regretted that. The matter has been dealt with.

The Minister for Justice and Equality will go before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions. That committee was set up by this Government and it now deals with this purpose. The Minister has no difficulty in going before the committee to deal with whatever questions, concerns or anxieties members of the committee might have. The Minister's sole remit is to obtain the facts and the truth because, as we have said on many occasions, it is imperative that the working relationship between and the integrity and credibility of the Garda Síochána and GSOC be maintained at the highest level. Under section 103, the duties imposed by subsection 1 do not extend to requiring the ombudsman to provide information where disclosure would, in its opinion, prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution, jeopardise a person's safety or for any other reason is not in the public interest.

The Minister briefed the Cabinet on the events that have occurred in the GSOC controversy following from the committee's hearing last Wednesday. He also briefed the Cabinet in regard to further information and documentation received from GSOC since then and further technical information he has received regarding the alleged surveillance of GSOC. In light of all of that information and his briefing, the Cabinet decided to appoint a retired High Court judge to review all of these papers and reports completely independently -----

It is more than two weeks since this controversy developed. The Minister announced that he would be bringing to Cabinet a number of amendments to the Garda Síochána Act 2005 relating to GSOC and it was agreed at today's Cabinet meeting that the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will be asked to hold hearings for members of the public, agencies and organisations. I have heard a number of comments from noted members of the public about the inefficiency of the law in this regard. The joint committee will hear views on how the law should be changed or amended, and will furnish its findings to the Minister. The Minister will appear before the Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions to address any questions, anxieties, concerns or issues that members may have fully, openly and comprehensively in the interest of truth and the facts.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	The only people who have been endeavouring to sow confusion on this issue are the Taoiseach and the Minister. I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the role and remit of the retired High Court judge. Can we expect a commission of inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 or simply the appointment of a retired judge to review documentation and make subsequent recommendations? Is that the scale of what will happen in respect of a matter that is extremely important? I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister did not level with the Dáil last week. He did not share written information that was in his possession because he wanted to down play the entire matter by saying it was just a bottle of smoke. One could hear the message on the news bulletins over the following 24 hours that we should move on because it was a bottle of smoke. The members of the commission had to go on "Prime Time" to bury that notion. The Minister did not refer to the fact that a public interest investigation had been invoked, that government level technology was being used or that the likelihood that the threats were benign was remote or close to zero. He should man up and apologise to the House for his behaviour on this issue and the manner in which he treated GSOC. The issue is wider than this. I raised it with the Taoiseach last week and it is not going away because I will be raising it again this week. There is something fundamentally wrong at the very core of the administration of justice. The Minister has taken the wrong route on this issue and on a number of other issues that go to the very heart of the administration of justice in this country. I know that certain Ministers know this. It is time the Taoiseach wised up to it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	I suggest to Deputy Martin, as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, that if he has information about the maladministration of justice in this country it is his duty and bounden responsibility to bring it to the notice of the Minister for Justice and Equality.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	I advise the Deputy that if he has information to back up what he has just said in this House as the leader of his party, he has a duty to bring it to the notice of the Minister and to do so in person. That has happened on many occasions previously. I was speaking about the appointment of a retired High Court judge to review all of the documentation and reports that have been produced on this matter to date. That will be done completely independently.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	Just a review.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	If Deputy Martin wants to question the independence of a High Court judge, he can do so. The judge will look at all the documentation, the process, the technical reports and the statements that have come from everybody in a completely dispassionate and independent way and report to the Minister in the next eight weeks.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	Interview the Minister and report to the Minister.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	It is evident from the Taoiseach's stance that he has been brought to the position of commissioning an independent inquiry very reluctantly. It is also a matter of fact that we have clear cut information on the matter and it is on the record that the Minister was less than forthcoming in his account to the Dáil. His account of matters did not tally with the document he received from GSOC. I ask the Taoiseach his response to that matter and what he intends to do about it. We need clarity on the proposed inquiry. All we know thus far is that it will involve the appointment of a retired High Court judge. Will the Taoiseach provide the Dáil with the full terms of reference for this inquiry? Why is the Minister for Justice and Equality setting the terms of reference? He has hardly covered himself in glory throughout this episode. What powers will the judge have and how much access will he or she be given to the systems and documents of An Garda Síochána? Will he or she be able to draw on a panel of experts who can read, understand and interpret technical data and matters relating to surveillance? This cannot be confined to the appointment of a judge to review documents. That is not sufficient. We need a thoroughgoing investigation that is fully equipped with the necessary expertise and powers to compel witnesses and papers so that the investigators can make balanced judgments and findings of fact. Why is the judge being asked to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality? Given that GSOC is accountable in the first instance to the Oireachtas, is it not more appropriate that the judge, following a full inquiry such as I have outlined, would report to these Houses?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	Surely Deputy McDonald is not questioning the independence and objectivity of a High Court judge. I do not expect she is insinuating that in her comments here. The High Court judge will be appointed shortly. The terms of reference will be drawn up by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the advice of the Attorney General.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	That is the problem.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	Of course, those terms of reference will be published. It means the High Court will have access to all of the documents and all of the technical reports. With regard to the requirement for clarity about the sophisticated technical issues in those documents, he will have the opportunity to have expert personnel explain what those complex technicalities might be. These can be difficult for many to understand.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	Statements.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	Deputy McDonald's point about balanced judgment is fair, and I expect that the decision taken by the Government here is a decision in the interests of finding fact and truth from all the documents, comments and statements, some of which have been quite confusing. It is important that that clarity brings the issue of the integrity of both GSOC and the Garda Síochána right into play here. For that reason, the decision of the Government to have the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality reflect in public hearings on the efficiency, effectiveness and robustness of the law is important. There have been many claims made about that. There is also the decision already announced by the Minister for Justice and Equality to make changes to the Garda Síochána Act in so far as GSOC is concerned to make it more accountable, transparent and professional in the issue of the Act. There are a number of processes here: the Oireachtas committee, the High Court judge, the Minister going before the committee tomorrow and the Private Members' motion that takes place here today and tomorrow. In all of these, the interest of the Government is to see that what has emerged out of all of these hearings leads to a conclusion in which the law can be made absolutely clear and transparent, in which there is integrity, belief and trust in both organisations, which have an important job to do, and to ensure that the committee in due course will respond to the Minister, for public discussion here, on recommendations in so far as the Act might be changed or amended.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	The Taoiseach knows full well that I was not questioning the independence of any member of the Judiciary, much less this judge, whoever she or he may be. Is he establishing this inquiry under the 2004 legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	No.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	We have clarity on that. The Taoiseach is entrusting the setting of the terms of reference for this inquiry - it is an inquiry, not a review - to the Minister for Justice and Equality. Can the Taoiseach see how there is a difficulty not only for Members of the Dáil but for members of the public with that approach? The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been deliberately evasive and has used tactics deliberately to distract attention from the issues at play in respect of this GSOC debacle. He has done that consistently and all of us, not only here but in the wider public, know that. Why leave the terms of reference in his hands? Why ask that inquiry to report back directly to him? Why would this inquiry not report to the Houses of the Oireachtas? Can we be guaranteed, for instance, that the full report, as and when it finds its way back to the Minister, will be made public? We need reassurances on these matters. We also need assurance that the judge in question will not only have access willy-nilly to expertise should the need arise, but will have an established panel of experts to assist that person in carrying out his or her inquiry. The judge would also have to know that he or she would have the power to compel, if necessary, different individuals, including, perhaps, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to co-operate with the inquiry and, for that matter, the Garda Commissioner or any personnel from GSOC.

I take from Taoiseach's remarks that he and his Government colleagues will be supporting the Sinn Féin motion when it comes before the House for debate this evening and for a vote tomorrow evening.

The Minister will introduce a clear set of amendments to Sinn Féin's motion which are in the interests of bringing about clarity, transparency, fact and truth.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	It is typical of Deputy McDonald to play the old political football in all of this. This is not an inquiry under the 2004 Act. The terms of reference are being set by the Minister for Justice and Equality as advised by the Attorney General. Is Deputy McDonald insinuating that the Attorney General is in any way complicit in something that might not be fair and objective?
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	The Attorney General only gives advice when the Government has a question on a point-----

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	I wish to raise another issue that has developed over the past week or two. In recent weeks, the Taoiseach, along with the Tánaiste, held out the possibility of tax cuts, as he said, as the Government finances improve. It would be a miracle of convenience if the scope of such tax cuts became apparent in the run-up to the general election. Such a cynical return to auction politics would surely fly in the face of everything the Government claims it stands for. The debate on tax cuts has begun and a conversation has started. The tax cuts are being presented as necessary to give middle-income Ireland a break, but who precisely is middle-income Ireland, and will cuts in income tax benefit anyone to any great extent? I refer the Taoiseach to the Quarterly Economic Observer from the Nevin Economic Research Institute, which was produced last week, based on the CSO's 2009 survey on income and living standards, which throws up some important facts, the most important of which is that there is now no middle-income Ireland. What exists is a vast army of poorly paid working people struggling to make ends meet. The average household disposable income after tax, PRSI and universal social charge is €46,000. Some 56% of householders have gross income of €10,000 to €50,000. There are 2 million adults with disposable incomes of less than €500 per week and more than 500,000 are on less than €200 per week. Only 30% of households have a gross income of over €70,000. Income tax cuts would benefit this layer but would do nothing for most households. Does the Taoiseach agree that what is required to give people a break is not a cynical political stunt by the Government on income tax cuts but a pay increase, particularly for the low paid, an increase in the minimum wage, strong wage floors in the revamped joint labour committees, and affordable child care? A 50% reduction in costs would give more families an extra €50 a week. These are the things that can be done.Is the Taoiseach prepared to look at these rather than introducing cynical tax cuts? In the debate on tax cuts, VAT has not been mentioned once, even though it obviously would have been of most benefit to those with the least.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	Do not hedge your bets.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	The Government has set out its priorities for this year in the sense that the action plan for jobs and driving forward the Government's priorities to grow our economy constitute the real priority in terms of creating jobs. As the Deputy is aware, following the exit from the bailout, the Government published its medium-term economic strategy. That indicates a 2% growth this year, 2.5% next year and 3% in 2016. It also indicates that in 2015 our deficit will be below 3%, eliminated by 2018, and all the jobs that were lost during the course of this recession restored by 2020. To that effect, the Government introduced a number of issues in the recent budget to help small and medium enterprises, including bank targets for increased lending and access to credit. The Deputy mentioned the minimum wage and other things but these are all matters that have to be considered and discussed as we prepare for budget 2015. Work on that measure is already under way. The Deputy also referred to the report from the Nevin Institute, but the ceilings have been set for this year and the budget is in place. As we move through 2014 the Minister for Finance and his Department will monitor the growth of our economy in the context of jobs.  For 20 consecutive months we have had a fall in the live register, which is now approaching European norms. That is the best way of giving young unemployed people an opportunity to get jobs and to pursue careers.  As regards the Deputy's question on tax cuts, I have made it perfectly clear that it is the Government's priority that people hit the high rate of tax on too low a wage at the moment. It is a priority to assist people in these sectors who are caught because of the challenges arising from the economic collapse a number of years ago. All of those issues will be considered by the Government as we prepare for budget 2015. That work will continue during the course of this year until the budget in October.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	The figures I cited were based on 2009 CSO statistics. After three more austerity budgets those incomes have been eaten into again. People are not demanding a cynical attempt by the Government to make a play on tax cuts, but rather to give them real money in their pockets. The Mandate union won a 3% increase for Penney's workers recently, backdated to 2013. Mr. John Callan, a shop steward from Dundalk, was delighted with the backpay but he spent it on the local property tax. Some 3,000 workers got 3% extra in their wages which should enable them to buy into the real economy. People on low incomes require wage increases, not tax cuts. That is what would make a difference to the domestic economy. I do not buy into this sort of auction politics. People are demanding that these real issues are addressed by the Government, rather than playing games.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	I do not accept the Deputy's assertion of auction politics. We have set out this clearly for the preparation of the budget for 2015. The discussion on tax cuts is part of a jobs plan to grow our economy and to provide employment. Research shows that is the best way to reduce the tax burden on people. The Minister for Finance has made it perfectly clear that is a priority for us. I know the Deputy did not support paying the household charge and she is also opposed to the property tax. Yet the councillors elected on 23 May will have the responsibility of making decisions about the provision of public services in local authority areas.  To answer the Deputy's question again, the Government has made it a clear priority that, depending on how the economy grows and the leeway available to the Government, the reduction of tax and widening of bands are priorities. Clearly, however, it will happen only if it can be afforded. In that sense, careful fiscal discipline and economic monitoring are important elements of the Government's work that is now under way as we prepare for budget 2015. There are no auction politics here; it is a straight statement of fact. The Government would like to be in a position to help people who are squeezed both by creating jobs and impacting on the level of tax. To be able to do that, however, we must continue with the momentum we have gained and not lose any ground. We will reflect on that as we go through the year and prepare for budget 2015 in October.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears and credit availability met on 20 January 2014 and has met on nine occasions since January 2013. I anticipate that it will meet again in March.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	I call Deputy McDonald on behalf of Deputy Adams.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	The Taoiseach has told us that the committee has met nine times since 2013. I would like him to confirm that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	That is correct.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	It met in January and the Taoiseach proposes that it will meet again in March. That does not suggest any great sense of urgency on the part of the Cabinet in respect of this issue. According to the Central Bank's figures more than 140,000 families are in arrears but those figures do not include buy-to-let properties. It seems to me the Government has made no real impact on reducing the numbers of families experiencing mortgage distress. For instance, in September 2009 the number of families in arrears for more than 90 days was approximately 3.3%. The latest statistics show that this figure has increased to 12.9%. Rather than having a solution to this matter we are seeing an escalation of the crisis for families and householders across the State. The number doubled in the last 18 months of the previous government and it has doubled again in the first two years of this Administration. A research paper by the Central Bank analyst, Yvonne McCarthy, states that three-quarters of all homes in mortgage arrears have at least one person in employment. That is interesting because it means that mortgage distress touches not just those thousands of unemployed people but also those in work. Ms McCarthy notes further that when one examines the figures, employment is not always secure. That raises all sorts of issues concerning security of employment, the misuse of flexible work arrangements and zero-hour contracts.  The Taoiseach amended the Land and Conveyancing Act in such a manner as to leave home-owners at the mercy of banks when the threat of repossession looms. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears has removed some of the protections the code originally offered to home owners. There are also issues around the personal insolvency regime, which was much lauded by the Taoiseach. For many people, however, it is not fit for purpose.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	176	Perhaps we could have a question.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	177	This does not add up to a confident scenario. Why is this Cabinet committee not meeting until March? Is there not an argument for more regular meetings? What is being done to add a new dynamic and urgency to dealing with this issue? The Taoiseach has said time out of number, both here and elsewhere, that this is one of the great crises facing our people.If this is one of the great crises facing our people, we do not deduce it from the record of meetings and the actions of the Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	I am more interested in taking decisions and action rather than just having meetings. We tend to meet on a monthly basis and devote one Monday in the month to seven or eight Cabinet sub-committee meetings. They start at eight in the morning and go through the day. That is why the committee will meet again in March. It is sometimes interfered with by requirements to attend meetings elsewhere. The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 has been passed and the legislation introduced three new forms of non-judicial debt settlement arrangement. The Act also reduces the automatic discharge period of bankruptcy from 12 years to three years. The Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, was established to regulate the new debt settlement arrangements and it is open to accept applications from applicants in September 2013. As of February, there are 111 personal insolvency practitioners who develop debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements. These are two of the debt solutions. There are also 63 individuals capable of acting as approved intermediaries who can develop a debt relief notice. The insolvency service has indicated that there are hundreds of cases in the pipeline at different stages of verification by the ISI before it can be forwarded to the court for a decision. The court may issue a protective certificate, which offers debtors legal protection for a period of 70 days, during which time an arrangement between the creditor or creditors and the insolvent debtor can be put together. To date, two debt relief notices, two debt settlement arrangements and one personal insolvency arrangements have been approved. There is, as yet, no definitive evidence of any banks vetoing proposals. There is some evidence that some banks are trying to reach arrangements with clients short of entering into a formal insolvency process. Banks are clearly becoming more focused in their attempts to reduce the mortgage arrears book and the existence of the ISI is helping as a catalyst in this process. Since March 2013, the Central Bank has set quarterly targets for six banks to make offers of sustainable solutions, and I mean sustainable solutions, to customers with arrears in excess of 90 days. These banks are Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank. The Central Bank has conducted an audit of the banks quarter 2 2013 results and found the banks have achieved their targets for sustainable solutions of 20% of those in arrears for 90 days or more. At the end of September 2013, the lenders in total report that they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears, as against a target of 30%. The Central Bank will shortly make undertaken audit of the banks progress against quarter 3 and quarter 4 targets for 2013. The introduction of the mortgage to rent scheme, which facilitates families to stay in their homes through the transfer of ownership to a local authority or an approved housing body is another issue. To date, almost 1,975 cases have been put forward by the lenders and, of these, 1,360 are being followed through.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	Is that mortgage to rent?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	180	In addition, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced a new €20 million fund to allow local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages. Deputy McDonald also mentioned arrears. The total number of mortgage accounts in arrears has fallen by 5,833 between August and December of last year. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has fallen from 82,624 to 79,782, a drop of 2,842 compared to the end of August. The number of total temporary restructures continues to fall and this indicates a move towards greater utilisation of permanent solutions. The total number of permanent restructures has risen by 9,952 up to December. There has been a significant rise in the split mortgages arrangements, from 2,500 to 6,239. The Central Bank mortgage arrears statistics reinforces the picture of a gradual improvement, although not as quick as one would like. Figures for quarter 3 to end of September in 2013 show that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears fell from 142,892, or 18.5% of the total stock, to 141,520. That is the first decrease since the Central Bank series began in September 2009. Deputy McDonald mentioned mortgages being sold to portfolio buyers and suggested they would not be regulated by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, of the Central Bank. The Deputy is aware that the sale process for the IBRC residential mortgages is currently under way. The final bidding date is 14 March 2014 and the continued application of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears in respect of the IBRC residential mortgage portfolio depends upon the regulatory status of who acquires the portfolio at the end. In 2012, GE Money sold its residential portfolio of approximately 3,500 mortgages to the Australian company Pepper Finance Corporation (Ireland). As the group acquired the entire servicing platform from GE Money, the acquired entity remains regulated and CCMA continues to apply to the transaction. In December 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold its Irish residential portfolio of 2,000 mortgages to Apollo Global Management. Apollo Global Management met the Central Bank and the Department and indicated clearly that it intended to voluntarily adopt the CCMA to manage the acquired loans. Apollo Global Management believes following CCMA is in the best interests of both and forms part of its core strategy. The Minister for Finance is aware of the concerns of borrowers about the sale of mortgage books to funds not covered by the CCMA. The Minister has instructed his Department to examine the issue in consultation with the Central Bank with a view to bringing forward a solution. Given that it is a complex legal issue, it requires careful consideration so as not to put at risk the application of the code of conduct. We will not know the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the portfolio until the sale process is concluded. The outcome will determine whether we need to do anything. The Fianna Fáil Party proposes to make adherence to the CCMA a condition of the sales process but the insertion of such a condition is legally questionable as it leads to the erosion of the value of the assets from which all creditors must seek proceeds. The insertion of conditions that may erode the value would leave the special liquidators and the State open to challenge and possible compensation. Under current laws, compliance with the CCMA is a necessary condition for lenders seeking to obtain court orders for repossessions of primary residences. The court will otherwise not allow it. I do not have figures to hand but the vast majority of repossessions have been voluntary. A number have gone down the court route but the vast majority have been voluntary. I can supply the Deputy with up-to-date figures.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	The inescapable reality is that the Taoiseach has no real appreciation of the huge crisis and distress in the lives of so many of our people as a result of unsustainable mortgages. Over the ten-year criminal property bubble, a generation of young people were blackmailed into paying prices for the simple human right of a roof over their heads, the level of which has now imprisoned them. With the number of crisis mortgages having doubled under this Administration, as the previous Administration did, putting forward that it has reduced somewhat, to just 80,000, as a major step forward does not in any way recognise that these are 80,000 individuals, or often families, who are hugely distressed.The Government has come up with no alternative of a sustainable variety that would provide a quick way out for those in distress. In his reply, the Taoiseach was at pains in referring to the 13,000 IBRC mortgages to look out for the interests of creditors, or in other words, the financiers that are involved. Their interests have always been put first. Is the Taoiseach in any way ashamed that his Government is handing over 13,000 individuals and families to vulture funds from God knows where? Despite what he said, these people do not and will not have guarantees if the mortgages are bought by outside interests based in the United States. Is it not the case that those home owners could be subjected, for example, to increases in interest rates and put under intolerable pressure with regard to repossession by means of threats or debt collection agencies pursuing them if the vulture fund wants to change or implement a sell-off in the portfolio? Is it not quite shocking that as far as the Fine Gael and Labour Government is concerned, the financial institutions, bondholders and the hedge funds which were up to their necks in creating the financial gambling casino that was the international financial markets in the ten or 15 years to 2008 - a cabal that reaped obscene profits on the backs of vulnerable mortgage holders-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	We cannot have speeches now, as this is Question Time.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	They crashed the economy as a result but the Government is now handing over the victims of the crash for further torture to the very people who caused it. Does the Taoiseach not see a massive irony, to say the least, in that? Some of the outlined solutions, such as split mortgages, are simply a matter of maintaining in bondage home owners into old age and even passing on the debts to their children. Is it not the case that a bold policy is required in the interests of our people rather than the financial markets? It should write down generally to today's prices the level of blackmail mortgage debt that people were forced to take, calibrate downwards monthly mortgage payments and give security to the people now in distress. It should also release hundreds of millions of euro per year into the domestic economy that would otherwise go into dead banks. It would be part of a process of rebooting the economy. Is that not the real issue? Has the Cabinet committee even discussed the IBRC mortgages or will the matter be discussed urgently in order to change the Government's implemented policy?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	Before the Taoiseach replies, I should point out that these questions are purely statistical, requesting the number of times a Cabinet committee has met. The line Minister is responsible for policy. We cannot go on at this rate, as we have spent almost 20 minutes on three statistical questions when other Deputies have important questions. I ask people to recognise that these sorts of issues should be raised with line Ministers rather than during Question Time for the Taoiseach. I ask everybody to be conscious of that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I remember when I used to sit where Deputy Martin is now and I would get no answer at all from the Government as there is no requirement to make any answer about Cabinet sub-committees. It is an important issue and I have indicated to Deputies that there can be a series of priority questions regarding particular issues. With regard to Deputy Higgins's contribution, we are talking about the recovery of the economy. The number of people in work is increasing and the number of people on the live register has been decreasing for 20 consecutive months. That is helping a number of people get out of their mortgage difficulties and provide the opportunity to make progress. I have given the figures to Deputy McDonald. There is a modest recovery in house prices, so that will lessen negative equity, although it does not apply all over the country by any means. It is a small but welcome development. Deputy Higgins is well aware that at the height of the so-called Celtic tiger we were building 100,000 houses when we needed 30,000 houses per year but we are now building 6,500 houses when we need 25,000 or 30,000 houses per year. To get to a point where we can catapult this goal into action, we must consider where planning permissions were issued that are not suitable for building, where other planning permissions are under consideration and the requirement for good contractors to be able to have a stream of income so as to develop a site and build houses. That requires a lending opportunity from a lender or lenders. There is clearly much pressure for detached and family houses in the greater Dublin area and that will be the focus of housing discussions here and at a special Cabinet meeting I called for next week. The Deputy specifically mentioned the IBRC. There are legal requirements to maximise the returns in all these cases and at the end of May there were 17,411 residential loans in IBRC outstanding to 13,000 customers. Taxpayers have already incurred far too high a price from this bank and no further costs should be imposed on them. It is important to note that the special liquidators have confirmed that all borrowers are permitted to pay their mortgage at par value and there are no legislative barriers to that. If the bids received are not in excess of the valuation set out, the portfolio will be sold to NAMA. As I indicated to Deputy McDonald, in two previous cases in 2012 and 2013, the full compliance not only of the contracts applicable to the mortgages but also the extra code of conduct requirements set up by the Central Bank were adhered to. The latest interested group has stated clearly that it wishes to be regulated and voluntarily submitted to abide by the codes of conduct if it ends up completing the acquisition. That is the interests of everybody. The position with regard to repossessions is very clear and I do not accept at all the Deputy's scaremongering tactics and argument that people will have investigators outside the back door telling them to move because the house is in negative equity or the mortgage holder is in arrears. If the bids are not received to value, NAMA will acquire these loans, and it complies completely with codes of conduct. Repossession is the last resort, and as I stated in response to an earlier questions, the vast majority of cases have been voluntarily submitted, as distinct from being a decision of the court. People make up their minds when they identify in their particular circumstances what is the best course of action. As the Minister for Social Protection has often pointed out, the fact that a person in a household is working allows for a solution to be brought about. The banks have set targets to offer people sustainable solutions by the end of the year and we want to keep the pressure on. This will be the subject of discussions at our forthcoming meeting.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I will allow very quick supplementary questions from Deputies Martin and Boyd Barrett.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	I will not have such a discussion. When will the committee meet again to specifically discuss those 13,000 mortgage holders affected by the IBRC liquidation, as the Taoiseach has mentioned March? The vast majority of these are rank and file people and they are being thrown to the wolves. They are very insecure and anxious about this issue.It is remiss of the Government not to have thought something through regarding this cohort of mortgage holders. In essence, their loans can be sold to concerns that will not be regulated by the Central Bank and that will not have obligations under the code of practice. When one talks to people, it seems that those higher up the scale get sorted out and looked after, while mortgage holders do not. Will the committee be meeting specifically on that issue in the very near future?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	With regard to the meetings the Taoiseach has had or intends to have, will he offer clarification because I did not quite hear what he said? He mentioned a debate or discussion on housing. As he knows, I have called for such a debate for two years. Owing to the mortgage arrears crisis and the potential for people to lose their homes or not to sustain their mortgages, something must be done urgently to provide affordable housing. Council housing-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	We are not moving on to affordable housing.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	Will the Taoiseach clarify when the discussion by the committee will happen? Will it happen in the Dáil? Has the committee discussed the potential implications of the winding up of the mortgage interest supplement scheme and how it may take more people into mortgage arrears? What will be done about it? Many people in the mortgage arrears resolution process – I received a letter about it this morning – are saying they are finding it extremely difficult to engage with the banks. One person who wrote to me had engaged an accountant to try to represent him before his bank in regard to updating his mortgage arrears resolution process agreement. He had adhered to it fully, but it was coming to the time of expiration and he was trying to renegotiate it. The accountant received a letter from the Central Bank stating it would not deal with the person's representative because he was not approved.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	The Deputy cannot proceed with this.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	This seems to run contrary to what the Central Bank is supposed to be doing, namely, assisting people in mortgage distress in dealing with the banks, rather than backing up the banks against mortgage holders.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	The Central Bank is the client’s own bank. Obviously, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has made quite a number of significant changes to the way we are dealing with the live register. The extent of mortgage interest payments - a figure of 50,000 comes to mind - was so high as to keep people out of work, despite the fact that getting them into work is the priority of the Government. I do not want to set out what the agenda of any Cabinet committee should be, nor am I entitled to say. Clearly, however, the discussion centred around these issues and the need to require banks to get on with offering sustainable solutions to people with mortgage problems or in mortgage arrears or distress. The targets I have set out have been met. In the two cases I have mentioned, in 2012, GE Money acquired 3,500 mortgages and complied fully with the code of conduct and the contractual obligations. The same applied in the case of Lloyds. It acquired 2,000 mortgages. It sold its mortgages to Apollo Global Management and voluntarily committed to honouring the codes of conduct set down by the Central Bank. The Minister for Finance has been very clear about this. It is a complex issue which warrants careful consideration. The Minister has written to the Central Bank outlining his concerns. If the bids do not reach the valuation, they pass to NAMA. NAMA complies fully with both the contractual obligations and codes of conduct set down by the Central Bank. As stated, repossession is the last thought in anybody's mind. The objective is to work out a solution in each case.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	As this is a statistical question, the supplementary questions should be based on that fact.

In the past 12 months the Cabinet committee on health met nine times and has met on three occasions since the October budget. It last met on 20 January and is due to meet again next Monday, 24 February.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	When the committee last met, was the issue of free GP care on the agenda? I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, who stated the Government's promised free GP care scheme might have charges attached. This runs contrary to the commitment of the Minister for Health that "free" will mean "free" and the commitment in the programme for Government to have universal primary care, whereby fees for GP care would be removed within the Government's term of office. Is the Taoiseach considering attaching a fee to the free GP scheme at the point of access? What might the fee be?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	That is a matter for the Minister for Health. This question should be to the Minister for Health.

I am not allowing this. It is unfair to everybody else who has tabled a question in that we will never reach some questions. Question No. 33, for example, relates to a discussion that took place on 19 December and we have yet to get to it. We will never get to these questions if we stray into every matter concerning health and mortgages. I cannot allow it and it would be grossly unfair of me to do so. I direct the Deputy to the question asked by Deputy Gerry Adams, that is, when the health committee last met.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	At that rate, the Taoiseach need simply to stand up and say the committee met six times.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	214	The Deputy is not being fobbed off because the question is about the number of times the committee met.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	215	I am putting it to the man who made the apology to the women concerned and who is on the front line in guaranteeing the commitments made to them are honoured. When precisely will these commitments be met, specifically in so far as they relate to health care? I trust that the Taoiseach can answer that question.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	No; he cannot answer it.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	Because it is not in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House; it is as simple as that. Deputy Gerry Adams asked the number of times a committee had met and the Taoiseach answered. The next question is by Deputy Micheál Martin and the same principle applies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	I have no doubt about that. The Taoiseach has stated the committee met nine times since the October budget. I believe he has said the committee is due to meet again in the next two weeks.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	There is a very acrimonious debate, through anonymous briefings in the media, between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the forthcoming White Paper on health. When will the health committee of the Cabinet meet specifically to discuss this issue? Will it be meeting to ensure the White Paper will give specific details on how much individual families will have to pay under the new system? Will there be a specific meeting on that issue, given the acrimony between the two Ministers? As the Taoiseach knows, the Minister for Health is saying nobody will pay more, that everything will cost less and that services will be expanded. I do not believe anybody believes this. I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach gave me a straight answer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	The White Paper is due to be published in a couple of weeks. It will deal with the changes in the structures that are required to introduce universal health insurance. That will not happen overnight. The White Paper will not provide details of individual costings because what is involved here is the level of charges that might be applied by insurance companies in regard to health a couple of years hence. There are issues which are clear and must be discussed regarding cost containment, the level of subvention that will apply in respect of particular packages and the range of medical packages that will be on offer from the insurance companies. These are all complex matters to be discussed. When the White Paper is published it will not individualise costings per package, because that is work that must take place over the next 18 months to two years. I can confirm that there were no acrimonious debates between Ministers. Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for future health care and the delivery of health services for years in the future. It will be discussed not only at the Cabinet sub-committee but also by the Cabinet.

All of these promises appear to be in the process of being pushed over the horizon of the next general election and disappearing into smoke. Will the Taoiseach arrange for the sub-committee on health to have a discussion on whether it is the case that all the pre-election promises to sort out our crisis-ridden health service are being shunted off until after the next general election? Following that meeting, will he clarify whether that is the case for the Irish public and this House? Are those promises now being abandoned? The Government cannot even manage to implement the free GP care for children under five years of age, not to mind provide it to everybody, or to sort out the universal health insurance, given the row that appears to be erupting between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister. After the next meeting of this sub-committee, will we get clarity on those matters? People need that clarity.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	Part of the process of the introduction of UHI is the introduction of free GP cards for children under five years of age. It is the first part of the process. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, has been very diligent in pursuing that and, as has already been announced, €37 million was allocated for it this year. This is not disappearing into smoke and is not being shunted out beyond the horizon. I made it clear on many occasions that universal health insurance cannot be introduced until the end of the term of this Government because we must deal with all the issues mentioned in Deputy Martin's question, such as cost containment, demographics and the range of the medical packages that will be provided by the insurance companies.

The White Paper on UHI will set out those structures. The work afterwards on the details, costings and range of medical care packages that will be provided by the insurance companies is a matter for very close scrutiny and consultation over the next two years.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	The Taoiseach's so-called fair care system and universal health insurance involves handing over inordinate power to private health insurers in our health service. When the Taoiseach produces his legislative proposals they will be hugely opposed by a substantial cohort of people in this country. I have a short question. When the Cabinet sub-committee on health meets, does it meet on specific issues relating to the health service, or does it have an overall report in general at every meeting? I did not think the Minister for Social Protection, who is beside the Taoiseach, had become the Minister for Health now in an advisory capacity to the Taoiseach. At the next meeting of the committee, will the Taoiseach make a particular issue of the crisis in speech and language therapy for children? It is a huge issue on which we receive representations from distressed parents on a weekly basis. There are very serious issues with regard to the development of young children. Will the Taoiseach put that down as a matter of urgency for extra resources to ensure an immediate ending of the waiting lists?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together. On 9 October 2013, I had an informal meeting with former US President Bill Clinton, who was visiting Dublin to attend an event organised by Philanthropy Ireland. The President is a very good friend of Ireland and is keenly interested in our progress, so I took the opportunity to update him on a range of issues in which he remains keenly interested. President Clinton, of course, has been a major influence on the Northern Ireland peace process over the years, so I updated him on the current situation in Northern Ireland, including the talks process chaired by Richard Haass, which was still in its early stages at that point. President Clinton has also provided valuable assistance to Ireland during our economic difficulties. In February 2012, for example, he hosted the "Invest In Ireland" round-table event in New York, which I attended. This was a valuable opportunity to engage with investors and to promote Ireland as a location for investment. Our meeting on 9 October was a good opportunity to update President Clinton on Ireland's progress towards economic recovery. He had a particular interest in this. We also discussed political and economic developments in the US. The main reason for President Clinton's visit to Dublin was to support Philanthropy Ireland, and we discussed recent progress with Ireland's objective of increasing the level of philanthropic giving. President Clinton also updated me on the work of the Clinton Foundation. I was pleased to learn about the progress the Clinton Foundation is making in tackling issues such as HIV-AIDS, health access, development, climate change and child health and nutrition. We also discussed Ireland's very successful partnership with the foundation through the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Ireland has partnered with the Clinton Health Access Initiative in Africa since 2003 and supports HIV-AIDS programmes in Mozambique and Lesotho, as well as programmes to improve maternal and child health and child nutrition. This was essentially the range of our conversation. I again took the opportunity to thank President Clinton for his ongoing support for Ireland over the years.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	As the Taoiseach said, President Clinton has been a friend to Ireland over many years, not least in respect of the Irish peace process. The Taoiseach said he briefed the President on what was, at that time, the early stages of the Richard Haass negotiations. Can I ask the Taoiseach, if I am allowed to, where the Government stands regarding the outcome of those negotiations?There is a marked reluctance, in some cases a downright refusal on the part of unionism, and by that I mean the political leadership of unionism, to embrace the opportunity that the Haass process represents. I think it very unfortunate, if one is to judge by some media commentary, that the American system has taken umbrage at the perhaps discourteous or even dismissive attitude of some towards Richard Haass and the outcomes of the process. That is deeply unfortunate. It certainly is not the disposition of my party. We see within those proposals real potential to deal with issues that are very difficult for parties on all sides. Will the Taoiseach comment on the Haass process and where he considers it stands now? Did the Taoiseach have any discussion with President Clinton on immigration reform and the issues faced by so many Irish people living in the United States who work there and have made their homes, lives and families there? Immigration is an issue of some controversy in the United States. It is a complex issue but it is one in which we have an enormous stake and it is one which we would wish to see resolved. The Taoiseach is correct to commend the work not least in respect of HIV-AIDS that is carried out. Like everyone else I am very proud of the fact that this country has such a strong track record on those matters. Those partnerships should continue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	We had discussions in the House on the conclusion of the Haass talks. We expressed disappointment that it was not possible to get agreement on the flags, parades and the past, but it is important to note that the Haass talks provide a basis for making further progress. As Deputy McDonald is well aware, that is not an easy issue. While her party agreed that the conclusion of the talks process should be endorsed, others did not. The talks were hosted on the invitation of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to Dr. Haass and his team. The five parties did engage pretty well during the two short periods in which they discussed matters. The process did not work out. I am pleased to note that at least the parties continue to follow through by having a series of meetings on how matters might be progressed. The Government is more than willing to support and assist in whatever progress can be made. The talks were not hosted by the Government or the British Government but we are very supportive of every little piece of progress that can be made in that regard. The Tánaiste spoke to the Secretary of State recently and also to Dr. Haass. I did discuss with the President the question of immigration. I hope to raise the matter again when I have the opportunity to travel to Washington in March. A great deal of activity is going on in the United States. I commend Ambassador Anderson on the number of meetings she has had both with representatives in the Senate and in the Congress on the matter. It boils down to what will happen in the US House of Representatives. President Obama and the US Senate have laid out their position very clearly. I cannot say what will happen with the House of Representatives but meetings are taking place. The general hope is that things could happen on immigration in 2014. We are approaching the last two years of this presidency for President Obama and in that sense there is an understanding that immigration has a major impact in the United States given the number involved. For our part, we will certainly engage with the immigration reform group and the Irish connections. There are 50,000 young Irish people in particular who are undocumented. It is a small segment of a very big pool but we would be hopeful that progress could be made. We discussed the matter and President Clinton is hopeful. President Obama and the Senate are also hopeful and now it is a matter for the House of Representatives. Elections are coming up later in the year and that might well impact on what action is taken. I will raise the matter again with the leaders and groups I hope to meet when I go to the United States. In so far as that is concerned, we will keep Irish interests very much alive and to the fore. I hope to mention it specifically to President Obama when I have the opportunity to speak with him.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	Could the Taoiseach confirm who attended the meeting? Was it just the Taoiseach and President Clinton or were others at the meeting as well? On the briefing the Taoiseach gave on Northern Ireland, Richard Haass and Meghan O’Sullivan came to Northern Ireland but the failure to reach agreement was very disappointing to all concerned and reflected badly on the main parties in the Executive. These issues are going on a long time, in particular the parades issue and flags and emblems. There have been many false dawns. There is an obligation on the main parties in the Executive to fulfil the commitments they gave a long time ago on those issues. The British and Irish Governments need to become more involved than has been the case. They are standing back a bit too far from the fray. The dangers that can develop are very real in terms of the communities in the North and the potential of the issues to create more disturbances on the streets, as we witnessed at the outset when the issues came back onto the agenda in terms of the flags dispute, protests on the streets and the threats to people in their homes. We do not want to go back to that. I wonder at the toleration of people who come from the United States and elsewhere to mediate in such situations. In some respects due deference is not shown by bringing the situation to a conclusion and getting a deal done. A deal could have been done but that did not happen on this occasion for reasons of focusing on one’s electoral base. Could the Taoiseach indicate the type of discussions that took place in terms of Ireland’s level of philanthropic giving? In that context, was there any discussion about tax relief or the situation pertaining to tax exiles and their treatment? The head of Philanthropy Ireland, Mr. Frank Flannery, has made public statements in that regard. Did he bring to the attention of the Taoiseach that the treatment of tax exiles should be changed in the context of the level of giving by the Irish philanthropic sector?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	Deputy Martin asked me who was at the meeting. I cannot recall, except to say that I was there myself with President Clinton and a couple of officials. I can send on the details to him. As far as I can recall, tax exiles and tax on exiles was not discussed. We had a discussion in respect of the work of Philanthropy Ireland. I indicated earlier that the President was in the country to attend an event relating to Philanthropy Ireland. He is very aware of Ireland’s efforts to increase the activity in terms of philanthropic giving. The forum on philanthropy and fund-raising set out a target to increase philanthropic giving by 10% year-on-year in Ireland from its current level of approximately €500 million per annum to €800 million per annum by 2016. The drivers were the national giving campaign, improving the general fiscal environment and the opportunity to give, developing fund-raising capacity among not-for-profit organisations and creating a national social innovation fund. Since the launch of the forum's report in July 2012 a good deal of progress was made in the implementation of the recommendations. The national giving campaign - the 1% difference – has been launched by Philanthropy Ireland. The tax treatment of donations to charities has been simplified and decoupled from business tax incentives.A road map has been set out for implementation of the Charities Act and establishing a charities regulator which the Minister announced some time ago. The social innovation fund has been incorporated and a board appointed. All of these things are moving in the right direction. I take Deputy Micheál Martin's point on dangers developing in Northern Ireland and cross-Border issues if there is no constant engagement and interaction. As I stated to Deputy Mary Lou MacDonald, these talks followed the invitation of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to Dr. Haass. I met him on a number of occasions, as did the Tánaiste, and we stated we were very supportive of his efforts. People may ask why they were not able to conclude them. It turned out that the most contentious issue was that of flags, as distinct from the past or parades. They made progress on all three fronts, on some more than others. It is fair to state that while they did not conclude by being accepted by everybody, there is a basis for moving forward at different levels on each of the three issues. The five parties involved intend to meet in the coming period, of which we are very supportive. I hope to travel to London early in March to speak further to Prime Minister Cameron and that from our perspective and theirs the support of both Governments will continue for the efforts of the parties to make further progress. I hope we will keep engaged and involved. We are cognisant of the dangers to which the Deputy referred and I share his concern.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	What is it about Presidents and ex-Presidents of the United States that so mesmerises establishment politicians in Ireland? Are they drawn to the aura of power or former power, the fact that the people concerned were and the incumbents are in charge of the biggest imperial power on earth? It is something about which I always wonder. When the Taoiseach takes advice from President Clinton, I ask him to be careful, particularly with regard to economic advice, considering that for eight years he presided over the policies of extreme liberalisation of the financial markets, the casino economy and the privatisation and liberalisation that took place which, among others policies, laid the basis for the disaster which became the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the Freddie Macs and Fannie Maes which crashed the economy with disastrous consequences for the working class people of the United States and the world. I ask the Taoiseach to be cautious when he takes an apparently uncritical approach to President Clinton. With regard to Northern Ireland and discussing issues of civil and human rights in which President Clinton supposedly took an interest, did the Taoiseach speak to him about similar issues in the United States, particularly about Irish America and how the establishment there treats the gay and lesbian community in banning it from marching on St. Patrick's Day in New York and Boston? Did the Taoiseach discuss whether he should boycott either of these marches in the event that he has been invited to them? The Minister for Social Protection who seems to be part of his protection detail today as far as Dáil duties are concerned has apparently taken such a position. Will the Taoiseach do the same or will he go along with the homophobic disgraceful approach taken by some of the conservative Irish-American institutions?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	257	It is not a case of being mesmerised by people who are or were elected to the highest political office in the United States, rather it is a case of engaging with people who either hold or held that high office and their interest in our country. The Deputy should never underestimate the advice and encouragement given to business interests from Ireland to invest in the United States and from the United States to invest in Ireland. On more than one occasion President Clinton has pointed out to international audiences of considerable significance the advantages Ireland offers in terms of its attractiveness as a location for investment-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	-----be it in terms either of the IFSC or the brain power Ireland exhibits in its young people and their ability to reach the highest targets and highs level of challenge. It has been a powerful instrument in delivering many US investors in our country and the resulting jobs and opportunities for the people. It is not a case of being mesmerised; rather, in the case of President Clinton, his interest in Ireland, the part he played in the peace process and his direction that George Mitchell should be the mediator in very difficult circumstances leading to delivery of the Good Friday Agreement more than 20 years ago were important considerations and decisions. The same applies in the case of President Obama who received a certificate of honorary Irish heritage because of his particular interest in the country. The Clinton years were very powerful for the US economy in terms of restoring economic credit to the United States, the number of people at work and the opportunities presented. Obviously, the bank collapse led to catastrophic consequences throughout the country. I hope to travel to the United States. The St. Patrick's Day parade is a parade about our Irishness, not sexuality. I will be happy to participate in it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	The Taoiseach has stated he discussed the issue of flags and parades with President Clinton. I suggest the New York St. Patrick's Day parade has given new meaning to what James Connolly called the carnival of reaction in its disgraceful refusal to allow people in the LGBT community to parade their identity. The Taoiseach should make some statement in response to this disgraceful decision. Will he comment on rumours that at least if he will not boycott the parade as some of us think he should, he will wear the rainbow badge to symbolise his support for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans community and make some protest over this really outrageous and homophobic decision to ban the LGBT community from the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York?

Obviously, the organisers set down their regulations for how the parade is conducted.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	It is proposed to take No. 6, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision 2005/681/JHA establishing the European Police College, CEPOL; No. 7, motion re appointment of An Coimisinéir Teanga; and No. 19, Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 [Seanad] - Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. tonight and shall adjourn on the adjournment of Private Members’ business, which shall be No. 137, motion re the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, and shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 7 or at 7.30 p.m., whichever is the later, and adjourn after 90 minutes, if not previously concluded; No. 6 shall be decided without debate; and the proceedings in respect of No. 7 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7.30 p.m. tonight and the following arrangements shall apply: the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and such Members may share time, the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and such Members may share their time, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply, which shall not exceed five minutes.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	274	In respect of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, I believe the Taoiseach indicated earlier there would be a referral of issues to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	275	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	276	Can the Taoiseach clarify whether the Government is proposing legislative changes or will be sending the heads of a Bill? In that context, my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, has published legislation that would give additional powers to the ombudsman commission, particularly in terms of bringing the Commissioner within its remit of accountability, giving access to PULSE and a number of other matters. Will the Government be prepared to facilitate the committee considering that legislation and discussing its contents? It was put forward in good faith by Deputy Niall Collins and is a constructive contribution to the issues in respect of giving greater powers to an independent statutory body such as the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. I ask the Taoiseach to clarify whether the Government proposes legislation. Second, with regard to the health (general practitioner medical service) Bill, there is much confusion abroad regarding the position of the Minister of State, Deputy White, which appears to suggest there will not be completely free GP care for all, which was a key promise and plank of the programme for Government. He suggested that nothing is free and that fees for the free service were being considered. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm when that Bill will be published and whether it will legislate for free GP care, as contained in the programme for Government? In that context, will the long-term illness part of the programme for Government be deleted or will it be followed through in this legislation? I refer to the commitment to provide medical cards to long-term illness card holders.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	As for the consideration by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, there has been a great deal of comment in recent weeks on this legislation's structure, efficiency and effectiveness. Consequently, the Government has asked the joint committee to take public hearings from those who have commented publicly about inefficiencies in the Act and so on. This is part of the change to engage with civic society to a far greater extent. I have not had sight of Deputy Niall Collins's Bill but if it is constructive, I am sure it can feed into the report the Oireachtas committee can make with regard to any recommendations for amendment, change or addition to this Act. The Government genuinely seeks to have a situation in which there is absolute integrity, a working relationship and working capacity between GSOC and the Garda Commissioner. I make the point that the other day, I heard some comments on the difference between the position here and in Northern Ireland. Whereas the ombudsman in Northern Ireland had the opportunity to oversee the chief constable, that ombudsman did not have the capacity to oversee MI5. We do not have an MI5 but have a Garda Commissioner.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	That is an odd excuse.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	279	Clearly, the High Court judge appointed to look at the use of surveillance equipment produces an audited report each year and has completely unobstructed access to all the information about that matter. There is a difference there that people must understand. This is part of a process and I am sure Deputy Niall Collins can feed his views and constructive proposals into that business. Alternatively, if he wishes, he may move his Bill here in the House. The Bill mentioned by the Deputy will be published in this session and obviously, people will have an opportunity to have their say on it.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	280	On that point, I presume that when the High Court judge is appointed to inquire into these matters, that High Court judge will have access to the same information as has the supervising High Court judge in respect of surveillance activities. The Taoiseach might clarify this point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	The terms of reference are being drafted at present for the judge to be appointed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	Everyone has the same access to that report because it is a published report on the direction of a High Court judge. In respect of access about the matters of surveillance, it is a published report each year.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the recent enactment of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Act 2013, which provides for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to regulate for sick leave across the public service. Does the Taoiseach remember this? Ministerial regulations are to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and these regulations can be annulled within 21 sitting days. This new sick leave scheme is due to begin on 31 March and the Minister responsible, Deputy Howlin, was to confirm last week when the regulations would be laid before the House but he has not done so. The Taoiseach might shed some light on that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	I am advised that a letter has been prepared for Deputy McDonald on that matter. The effective date for implementation is 31 March.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	I refer to another matter I attempted to raise with the Taoiseach earlier, I am advised inappropriately, because I was not asking the questions. Therefore, let me now ask the Taoiseach about this matter pertaining to promised legislation from the Department of Health on foot of the Quirke recommendations for the Magdalen women. I remind the Taoiseach that promises were made and agreed in respect of the health needs of these women. The services were to include GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental services, ophthalmic services, aural services, home support, home nursing and counselling services, as well as a range of other services including chiropody and physiotherapy. None of this has been delivered on despite the fact that together with many others, I have raised this issue repeatedly. It appears as though there is a block in the Department of Health in respect of the necessary legislation to make these services available. When will that blockage cease and when will Members have sight of the legislation? Then when will the Minister for Justice and Equality and his Department introduce the necessary measures to make sure those services will be equally available to survivors who live outside of this jurisdiction?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	I stated there was a letter for the Deputy regarding the other matter of 31 March. For once, I can confirm to the Deputy that there is no blockage in the Department of Health.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	That is not what I have been told by the Department of Justice and Equality.

The Government made it clear in respect of the Magdalen decision that it wished to be as generous as possible to those who live within and outside the State.The Magdalen report is being implemented. Much work is being undertaken, payments are being made, etc. This Bill from the Department of Justice and Equality dealing with these issues is on the A list and will be published this session.

Can the Taoiseach facilitate a debate on this issue and will he agree to putting a stay on plans to spend €13 million at University Hospital Galway to replace a state-of-the-art acute psychiatric facility already commissioned in Ballinasloe, which is costing €3.1 million?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	That sounds like a parliamentary question to me.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	The matter is one for discussion on Private Members' Business in the Seanad. Deputy Naughten is aware of the Vision for Change document setting out the view on how psychiatric conditions should be dealt with for the future. I am aware of the situation in Ballinasloe in both St. Brigid's Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is dealing with this area. There are patients in St. Brigid's in a new unit, as yet unopened, who are supposed to be in the unit which is deemed to be closed, with the transfer of patients to Galway. There are implications for Portiuncula and Roscommon. I am not sure which entity Deputy Naughten favours and whether he wants them both kept open in the context in which they were built.

It is a case of not losing focus on the patients, who should be the central feature of all concerns here - both the younger psychiatric patients and elderly people with a psychiatric condition.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	Yesterday it emerged that considerable funding is needed in Gallery Quay in the docklands, purchased by Túath Housing, to refurbish homes purchased which were not properly built. Many homes around the country could be in the same position and voluntary housing bodies could face serious financial problems as these are discovered. Tenants need to know where they stand when they are left without a home by one of the main prongs of Government housing policy. Will the forthcoming housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill provide protection for these tenants of voluntary housing schemes?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	I am afraid we do not discuss the contents of Bills, only when they are due.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	As far back as 2002, when I was a member of the Midland Health Board, the strategic task force published its report and recommended an outright ban on alcohol advertising. We have the largest binge-drinking population in Europe, something we cannot be proud of.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	That is all very interesting, but this is the Order of Business.

#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	316	There is a commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a gender recognition Bill. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has referred the general scheme of the Bill to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection. That committee has concluded its consideration and consultation process. When does the Taoiseach expect to see the legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	It is part of the more open process to have the committees take pre-legislative hearings in order to engage with civic society to a far greater extent than ever before. That is concluded by the committee and it will send a report to the Minister, who will then prepare the detailed process of the legislation. It is on the conveyor belt, but having engaged with wider society far earlier than used to be the case.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	It is two and a half years since the Government announced that the strategic investment fund would be established on a statutory basis to channel money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund into commercial projects. For whatever reason, we are still awaiting the legislation, which will facilitate job creation. The Betting (Amendment) Bill is going through the House, awaiting Committee Stage. The gambling control Bill should be taken in parallel to deal with the negative aspects of betting, particularly the addictive nature of some of the betting patterns in the country. Why is that Bill delayed and when will it be published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	It is not due until the back end of this year. The Betting (Amendment) Bill awaits Committee Stage. The National Treasury Management Agency (amendment) No. 1 Bill, which will deal with the strategic investment fund legislation, is listed for publication this session. That is practically finalised and I expect it to be published very soon.

To what extent have the heads of that Bill been discussed or approved by Cabinet? When can we expect to see it before the House? The Red Cross (amendment) Bill has been proposed for some considerable time. The good people sitting in opposition now had thoughts on it before they left office. Have the heads of the Bill been approved, when is it likely to come before the House, and is it likely to be passed this year?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	The Red Cross (amendment) Bill is not listed on the current programme and the heads have not come before Government. At the current rate of progress it will be next year before it is published. I asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to send around an up-to-date information note on the adoption Bill for Members of the House. This is not as easy as it seems. There are complex legal and constitutional issues involved.

A number of organisations are in touch with us to get an approximate timescale on this.

The CAB has raised a number of issues that need to be teased out. I presume the organisations Deputy O'Dea mentioned were anxious about the gender Bill have already given their proposals at the pre-legislative hearings. It now goes into the process of a report being prepared for the Minister and they can then translate this into the legislation. Once the Minister receives the report I will be able to give a better idea of when it might be published.

Two key issues have arisen recently: the publication of mortality rates in the various hospitals throughout the country and the consultants' report into maternity services in the west, with which the Taoiseach will be very familiar. When will this Bill be published? It is critically important that we have informed debates on these issues. Major concern is being raised about maternity services in the west. As a proud Mayo man, the Taoiseach would like people to continue to be born in Mayo for many years to come.The report will undermine confidence in maternity services in the west today, tomorrow and next week. We cannot wait a long time for the Bill when there is concern among the public about the consultants' report on maternity services. The same holds true with regard to the report on mortality rates in hospitals and the comparisons between them. When will the Bill be published? It might bring some credibility on the issue of data.

The Bill would enshrine the dual mandate of Members of the Oireachtas - of representation and responsibility to conscience - in the Constitution. It is clear and simple. It reads: "The Members of each House of the Oireachtas shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience". This is identical to the second sentence of Article 38.1 in the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Constitution of Germany. The explanatory note on the Bill clearly and simply sets out its purpose, objectives and how it would work. The purpose of the Bill is to effect an amendment to Article 15 of the Constitution by inserting a new section 15.16 after section 15.15. The proposed new section would provide that all Members of the Dáil and the Seanad "shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience". The background is Article 38.1 of the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany which states:Members of the German Bundestag shall be elected in general, direct, free, equal and secret elections. They shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions and responsible only to their conscience.Accordingly, this is an independent mandate. Therefore, any coercion to influence a Member's vote, be it legally, physically or psychologically binding, including an obligation to vote in line with a political party's policies, would violate that basic law. Party discipline among the members of parliamentary groups can, therefore, only be based on the Member's free decision. The principle of Members of the German Bundestag being responsible only to their conscience was enshrined in the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany in the re-establishment of the Bundestag following the Second World War. This has the effect that fundamental democratic principles cannot be undermined by incremental, non-transparent power grabbing by individuals, parties, organisations or groups. This fundamental principle of Members being responsible only to their conscience also applies in the subsidiary regional parliaments of the Federal Republic of Germany. Under the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany, Members of Parliament are responsible only to their conscience and party discipline is based on this freedom. Generally, parties adopt a joint or party position on issues and members who opt to deviate from the joint position must announce this deviation ahead of any vote. The rules of procedure grant them the right to explain their vote, orally or in writing, after the conclusion of the vote. Explanations of votes are commonly made in the Bundestag. At other times the parties will not adopt joint positions. This usually happens in the case of matters of conscience or ethical matters. The principle of individual responsibility only to conscience has worked well in Germany in the aftermath of the Second World War through coalition governments and governments which have had a very slim majority. The proposed new provision sets out to replicate in an Irish constitutional context the elements of this basic law and express the fundamental principle that the individual Member's responsibility is only to his or her conscience. I remind Members that this proposal is an exact lifting of the official translation. I also remind them that Edmund Burke, one of the greatest thinkers of his or any other time, established the same principle. In this regard, I invite them during the course of the debate to read the book by Jesse Norman, MP - perhaps the best regarded backbench MP in the United Kingdom - Edmund Burke: Philosopher, Politician, Prophet.  There are other jurisdictions in which the same principle is established. In New Zealand 5% of all legislation has been introduced on this basis. This is true in the United Kingdom also. There are areas such as neutrality, the declaration of war, the defence of human rights, biological and scientific research and human embryo research where there is or ought to be an enshrined dual mandate - representatives of the whole people and responsible only to conscience.

It also needs sufficient capacity for the future and accessibility to sustainable energy generation. It needs to provide this energy in an even manner across the regions. What we do not need is a system that may endanger the lives and health of citizens or create fear. We do not need a system that will reduce the cost of agricultural land and personal property. We do not need a system that will prevent the development of the energy market for decades, owing to intractable conflict. We do not need a system that will be forced on unwilling communities throughout the State. In the mid-north east, where it is proposed to provide the north east-south interconnector, we have had six years of this process. We know more than most what is involved. We have had surveys, meetings, fund-raisers, Oireachtas committee meetings and expert reports and in the intervening period there has been a huge increase in the level of technology. We are now faced with confusion.I believe the Minister made a statement to The Irish Times at the end of January indicating that the North-South interconnector could not be put underground. This is despite the Government’s paying big money to an independent commission which stated that it could be put underground and after the fact that similar kV lines from Rush to Batterstown in County Meath run underground. We were told initially that the Minister said that it would not be included in the current review. I have some sympathy for the Minister because the Taoiseach may have pulled the rug from under his feet, after speaking to some of his backbenchers, and disregarded a Cabinet agreement on the North-South interconnector. An EirGrid planning application is being withheld, or held back, until the independent review decides how to proceed. I stress that the North-South interconnector’s material impact on the citizens of the counties it goes through will be no different from that of any of the other projects going through the country. Not including it in the review is shockingly unfair to the citizens of that area. The North-South interconnector, Grid West and Grid Link projects have the same challenges and issues. They should be afforded the same level of analysis. I have heard the talk of urgency in that the North-South interconnector project is further advanced - some have stated that it is 97% there. This is not true. It is at planning inquiry stage, exactly as it was almost five years ago. EirGrid withdrew the planning application from this project in the middle of the oral hearing in 2010 because of a lack of thoroughness in its submission. Where is EirGrid's urgency in that process? A total of 97% of landowners along the route of the North-South interconnector have stated that they will never allow EirGrid onto their land to proceed with this. This has major implications for the opportunity for this project to proceed in a timely fashion. We are nowhere near 97% of the way through this process.  It has also been stated that there have been two previous reports on the North-South interconnector. These reports, however, did not tackle the proper construction cost and route identification, neither did they include the cost-benefit analysis to cover all the associated costs outside the technical and construction costs. We should make sure that we proceed in that manner.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	I have appointed an independent panel of experts, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, a former judge of the Supreme Court, to decide terms of reference for comprehensive, route-specific studies of fully underground and overhead options for EirGrid's Grid Link and Grid West projects. The panel will ensure that the studies are complete, impartial, objective and comparable. Both the overhead and underground options will be published side by side, in objective and comparable terms, before consideration is given to appropriate next steps. On the North-South transmission line, the situation is different. Planning for this project has been under way for the past ten years. A planning application has already been submitted for the part of the project in Northern Ireland and that planning process is in train. Detailed studies have already been conducted, most recently by the independent international commission of experts appointed in July 2011. A route-specific underground analysis was conducted by PB Power, which found that the cost of undergrounding would significantly exceed the cost of the more usual overhead cables. The PB Power analysis was considered and confirmed by the independent commission, which estimated that the cost of undergrounding would be at least three times that of overhead cables. The North-South transmission line is a critical and strategically urgent transmission reinforcement and is of vital importance in the broader North-South context. As well as reinforcing the grid in the north-east region of this State, the transmission line will be vital to maintaining the security of electricity supply for Northern Ireland into the future. I met with my Northern Ireland counterpart, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, to discuss the very real security of supply concerns that would arise for Northern Ireland from any significant delay in progressing this project, and to assure her of our continued commitment to timely delivery. I have previously said I recognise the public would be reassured if they knew that the overhead and underground options for North-South were both investigated and that the published studies are sufficient to enable a similar comparison be made by An Bord Pleanála in deciding on the merits of this planning application. When I met Mrs. Justice McGuinness I accordingly asked her to consider what work, if any, the panel might usefully undertake to establish whether there has been parity of treatment between the North-South project in terms of the work already undertaken and the issues the panel will examine in respect of Grid Link and Grid West. Mrs. Justice McGuinness has since convened the first meeting of the panel and she has undertaken to raise with it what, if anything, it can do to help. Another very relevant factor is that the North-South line has been designated at EU level as a 'project of common interest', one of 248 key trans-European energy infrastructure projects listed as such. It seems now to be clear, although I have yet to receive formal confirmation that, because of this status, the planning application will be subject to enhanced principles for public participation, which are set out in EU Regulation 347 of 2013, published in April last year. It is too early to say to what extent this enhanced form of public participation in the planning process - which I stress will apply to the North-South project alone - might meet the concerns of the public and, perhaps, make separate and additional deliberations by another body both unnecessary and otiose.

The Minister mentioned it has taken ten years to get the planning levels to this point. The nub of the problem is that the current conflict is leading to delays and each year of delay costs tens of millions of euro. The Minister also mentioned the two reports. If they are relevant to the North-South interconnector they are also fully relevant to the other projects overhead around the State, which have exactly the same issues. One of the key differences in the expert panel the Minister has put together is that it has been given the latitude to develop its own terms of reference and will include the full comparative analysis of underground versus overhead. This option was not available for the other report whose terms of reference did not allow it to study costs other than potential technical costs, in other words, the hundreds of millions of euro costs caused by the drop in property and land prices in the area. The sense of urgency that the Minister mentioned should also be afforded to the other projects. If they are urgent we should seek a process to allow them to proceed without replicating what has happened in the case of the North-South interconnector which has gone on for ten years. We need to develop a framework model to restore public confidence and participation in this process. The exclusion of the North-South interconnector does nothing for public confidence. We all need and want to see a conclusion to this process but we want it to be based on fact rather than the current system.

It is a considerable parliamentary talent to be able to present obstruction and opposition in reasonable tones. Some mornings I wake up and hope I live long enough to see Deputies Tóibín and Mary Lou McDonald being given responsibility for doing something, as distinct from talking up opposition to everything. This project has been planned for ten years. Deputy Tóibín says he accepts there is urgency around it. If he does not accept it, if he talks to his colleagues in Northern Ireland where they have real concerns about security of supply in the not too distant future, they will reinforce the point of view for him. A route specific analysis was undertaken by PB Power for Eirgrid and there was the international commission to which the parties that comprise the current Government committed. It was carried out by experts from Scandinavia and Belgium and their conclusions are in the public domain. All I can say at this stage is that we should leave it to Mrs. Justice McGuinness to opine. I have explained that I have put the case to her and she, in turn, has undertaken to examine with her expert independent panel what, if anything, they can do to assist in this situation because it appears that the Deputy and I are agreed that the country needs an interconnector that is fit for purpose and that, which not being in place, is costing between €20 million and €30 million per annum. There is some urgency attaching to this matter, particularly in Northern Ireland, and we have to let the process in place work itself out.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	I welcome the funding allocation the Minister announced recently which will go a long way towarding repairing many of the piers and quays and harbour infrastructure damaged and also the €1.5 million in funding announced to alleviate the losses incurred by some inshore fishermen through the loss of shrimp and lobster pots and other gear. I am pleased to report that in the past day or two much of the fishing fleet that had been tied up for so long finally put to sea but a problem remains. Many of the fishermen who will go to sea today will not be in a position to catch many fish for the next few days, perhaps even for a week, because of the swell. Effectively, the nets are hopping along the bottom of the sea. This will make for a very poor fishing trip but desperation has forced them out in relatively safe and good weather. I wish them well. I am a little pessimistic, but that is the reality as relayed to me. Even when they do make a catch, it will be some weeks before they receive any remuneration for it. The reality is that it takes a couple of weeks for the cheque to arrive in the post. It will take at least eight to ten weeks for some fishermen solely because of the bad weather.  Allied with this, the Minister is aware of the challenging quota issue in the whitefish sector. Unfortunately, some fishermen have not had the benefit of a remuneration package or a cheque in the post since October. That aside, I want to ascertain if it is possible to come up with a compensation scheme for fishermen, many of whom will go on a trip of up to five days. Some of those heading for the Porcupine Bank to fish for prawns could be taking a 15 day trip to earn a wage to put food on the table for their families. A compensation scheme was initiated about 20 years ago but it was so badly handled by the previous Administration that Members of this House could claim money. That was a poor reflection on that Administration and there are those in the fishing industry who criticise that scheme. They will say it was inefficient, poorly administered and not targeted, but the position has changed. The regulations in the administration of sea fisheries have been tightened and a scheme could be easily targeted at those worst affected by the recent bad weather. I raise this issue also in the context of the much publicised comments made by a French MEP who publicly stated there might be access through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, under Article 33(c)(1). Even though it has not yet been fully signed off on, it may well be a provision through which this country could make an application for funding. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the Department and his officials were considering making such an application. If not, will he consider providing for some compensation scheme for hard-pressed fishermen and their families along the coast? We have heard calls from our colleagues in the North of Ireland who are also affected by weather issues. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	343	I thank the Deputy for raising this genuine issue. I know that he comes from the heartland of the whitefish fleet in Castletownbere and this is primarily a whitefish fleet issue. We have tried to do what we can within the rules and regulations. That is why, for example, in terms of a Government response, we have committed nearly €9 million to repair over 100 harbours and piers around the coastline and also nearly €1.5 million for fishermen who have lost gear, in the form of pots, and will have to bear the cost of replacing it. We will provide capital grant aid of about 40%. However, that is no of consolation to those involved in the whitefish sector who are looking to catch in the months of January and February a quota allocated in these months. In terms of the EMFF, the truth is that it has not been signed off on yet and we do not know how much money Ireland will be allocated. It would be naive and foolish of me to look to spend money when we do not even know how much we will have to spend and I do not have access to it. Some have been calling on me to do this and deal with the issue retrospectively in six or eight months' time when we hope people will be fishing and have had a good middle of the year. I am anxious to do something practical to help people. We sat down in the Department today to examine what we could do. We have looked at the figures for the amount of fish caught in the whitefish sector in January and to date in February. The figures for the pelagic sector are quite impressive. There has been a very significant landing of mackerel and horse mackerel. Some 40,000 tonnes of mackerel and 18,000 tonnes of horse mackerel have been landed, primarily in Killybegs, in the north west, but on the whitefish side the story has been very difficult. Many boats have not been out since mid-December. About half of the whitefish quota allocated was caught in January and probably less than this has been caught so far in February. We are looking to convene a special meeting of the quota management advisory committee which essentially comprises representatives of the industry and my Department to look at a significantly increased allocation for the remainder of February and next month in order that, as fishermen start to have a weather window, they could catch much more fish than they would otherwise be alllowed to catch and in that way try to compensate them for what happened in the first six weeks of the year which proved very difficult for them. Fishermen will, rightly, tell me that there is a real problem in that when there is very bad weather, for safety reasons they cannot go out and as a result have no income. If I had access to a fisheries fund and was allowed to provide some income support, that is something we would examine. I spoke to my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, this morning. The Department of Social Protection has a facility to provide income support within the fishing industry under a number of schemes, in particular the fish assist scheme.I recognise that is somewhat limited for many people because of the difficulties they have with access and the assessment procedure. Given that fishermen have gone out today and yesterday, I want them to be able to catch more fish. I hope the weather window lasts so they can earn a living. We will allow them to catch more fish than they would otherwise catch for the remainder of February and next month to make up for the fact that they have caught only half of the quota allocated to them in the whitefish sector thus far this year. I hope that will allow them to catch up in terms of income after a difficult start to the year.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I welcome the Minister's proposal for allocating extra quota over the next six weeks. Fishermen do not want to go cap-in-hand to anybody. It is a proud industry, albeit a difficult one, and they do not want to look for funding. However, most of them are now living on credit and the goodwill of businesses in their areas. We need to have a debate on the fish assist scheme because it is far from perfect with respect to fishing. I am increasingly convinced that issues of social protection, combined with evolving policy on days at sea for the demersal or whitefish fleet, will give rise to some form of family income supplement instead of fish assist. These individuals are self-employed and even though they are not fishing it does not mean they are not working. They may not be earning but they still have to respond to their skippers' requests to keep their vessels and gear maintained. They are working every day of the week they are ashore but they have no prospect of being paid in the next couple of weeks. I look forward to seeing how the extra allocation of quota will be divided. I hope it will take account of when prices are optimal and that the extra quota will not have a depressing effect on prices.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	I share the Deputy's concerns. Many people do not understand how the fishing industry works. Those who work on a trawler receive a percentage of the catch rather than being paid a salary as such. Essentially, they are sole traders working on somebody else's boat, with the result that they do not have easy access to social welfare without a time-consuming assessment procedure. We need to consider issues of income protection for people who are committed to the fishing industry. The sector also employs a considerable number of non-Irish nationals who work as deckhands on fishing boats. Issues arise in this regard which we also need to consider. I started a conversation with the Minister for Social Protection this morning about income issues in the fishing industry, and we will continue that conversation. In the meantime, however, I want to give a strong signal that we are going to hold a special quota management meeting this Friday to significantly increase the amount of quota that boats in the whitefish sector will be able to catch for the next six weeks so that they can catch up, from an income and cashflow point of view, as long as the weather permits. If the weather window does not persist we will have to consider other ways of supporting the families concerned.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	In responding to the previous Topical Issue, the Minister discussed the precarious existence of fishermen. I take this opportunity to draw attention to the increasingly precarious existence of Irish farmers due to prices. The volatility of milk prices has been well ventilated but we are also seeing great volatility in beef prices, particularly bull beef prices. I discussed this issue over the weekend with Deputy Ann Phelan, who wanted to partake in the present discussion but unfortunately had to attend another meeting. I understand the Minister recently met representatives of the IFA to discuss this issue. As he will be aware, the price for bull beef has fallen by €150 to €250 per head since feeding started this year. This is now beginning to have an impact on beef prices more generally. The number of livestock killed per week currently stands at approximately 31,000, and we are edging towards the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, but two years ago when the targets were being set, farmers did their part by retaining bulls, including Friesian bulls, and meeting the cost of feeding them. They are now paying the price, however, because they are losing money on every head of livestock they hold. This calls into question some of the general targets in Food Harvest 2020. If the result of increasing our beef kill to 31,000 per week is a fall in prices, farmers will be worse off as a result of ramping up production. I should point out that I am a farmer. I finish cattle, although I am not a winter finisher. The prices obtained in September for cattle finished on grass were higher than the prices beef farmers are now getting for finished steers. As the Minister will be aware, the cost of finishing cattle in the winter is much higher. Farmers are taking losses on cattle they are finishing. I realise there are no easy answers to this problem. The factories will say there is no market for all of the bull beef produced, but farmers were encouraged to finish these bulls. If there is no market, it raises the question of why they were encouraged to finish them. Over time greater efforts will be needed to find markets for these bulls, but in the short term I encourage the Minister to call a meeting of producers, the IFA and the factories to see what can be done to ensure the ongoing viability of the beef sector. Farmers took losses across the board last year. We had an excellent summer but last winter was difficult. Farmers cannot take another winter of losses without the beef sector being damaged.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	I thank Deputy McNamara for raising this important issue. I spent considerable time discussing the issue with the IFA this afternoon. The value of Irish beef exports was estimated at almost €2.1 billion in 2013. This export performance, which was based on a wide portfolio of customers, has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia's marketing strategy and its focus on the key attributes of Irish beef, namely, environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages of production and superior eating quality. I am committed to developing a policy framework that fosters innovation and promotes efficiency and improved performance at all levels of the beef supply chain. Aggregate cattle supplies at Department-approved meat plants to early February 2014 are up 7% on the corresponding period in 2013, with strong increases recorded in the steer, heifer and cull cow categories. This higher throughput has led to factories giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the requirements of their retail customers. Prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable but the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand. However, I note that the young bull kill increased by 60% between week one and week six of 2014. The Irish beef sector is hugely dependent on exports and needs to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets. One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls older than 16 months is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU and it is where we sell most of our beef. Delays in young bull slaughtering undoubtedly put pressure on producer profit margins but neither I nor any agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations. Of course, I am entirely sympathetic to those farmers facing difficulties in getting their cattle slaughtered at a price that will allow them any margin at all. In our discussions today, I gave a commitment to ask the CEOs of the meat companies concerned to come into the Department to have a blunt conversation to find a way forward that farmers can accept as fair and that factories can maintain an acceptable margin on, and I hope to do that within the next day or two. It is the responsibility of the industry - in the first instance, processors and farmers working together - to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of bull beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. I understand that producer and meat processor representatives have recently engaged in dialogue with some initial progress being made, but I can vouch for the fact that there is much more progress required in this area. I fully recognise that we need to maintain confidence in the beef sector and earlier this month I announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to €40 million to beef farmers in 2014. This package will include €23 million for the beef genomics scheme, €10 million for the beef data programme, €5 million for the beef technology adoption programme and €2 million in residual payments under the suckler cow welfare scheme. That being said, we have a genuine problem in the bull beef sector which is now translating into a problem in steer beef and heifer beef also. Producers, that is, farmers, are growing ever more frustrated by this. I will do what I can to assist in the process but, ultimately, both parties concerned will have to find an acceptable solution moving forward.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	I greatly welcome the fact that the Minister acknowledges there is a problem and that he will do what he can. He mentioned that there was an increase in bull beef killed in the first weeks of this year but no doubt part of the reason for that was that, normally, beef prices increase in the run in to Christmas, this year they did not and many farmers were holding on in the hope that the prices would inevitably increase although they still have not done so. The factories are aware there is a glut out there and they intend to take advantage of it. That is one side of the coin. The State has consistently stepped up to protect the sector because it is hugely important, and a facet of that sector is the factories. When the factories were in trouble last year with the horses, we stepped up. The Dáil was reconvened during the summer to protect one group which now enjoys a dangerously dominant position in beef, both here and in the United Kingdom, which is a considerable market. The Minister mentioned that retailers are not interested in this type of beef, and that is true. The unhealthy power that retailers, particularly the large multiples, enjoy is something that we have worked on in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I note Deputies Doyle and Deering are here today and we all put a great deal of work into that. Not surprisingly, there has been a certain backlash from lobbyists and other groups. Those retailers have an unhealthy power to determine and, ultimately, they can decide that they will increase or drop prices whereas farmers have to plan two or three years ahead. As I stated, farmers made plans a year or two years ago to increase bull beef production because they were told that was the thing to do and now they are losing money because of it. Notwithstanding all of that, I greatly welcome the fact that the Minister is calling in the CEOs of the processors to a meeting. I would ask whether he would consider bringing in a farmers' representative to that meeting as well, if that is feasible. In the longer term, I would ask is there a way to find markets. I welcome the fact that there is a live trade being opened up through Stena but we need to increase the live trade to third countries outside of the EU. Every calf we export live, if it is exported to European markets, we face as competition to one that we rear in Ireland whereas if we can get them out to third country markets it is a different matter entirely. However, I welcome what the Minister has done. My last suggestion, which may seem a little silly and many might find funny, applies to all Ministers. There are many of them going abroad. Maybe one item on each of their agendas should be whether there is a market in the state they are visiting for bull beef because, as the Minister stated, it is a particular market. British retailers, in particular, which are important customers for Irish beef, are not interested in it but that does not mean that there cannot be markets somewhere in the world, maybe even in Sochi, for bull beef. Who knows?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	Last year we got Japan, Lebanon and the Gulf states open. We got live exports to North Africa, which is a difficult market to manage. Even today, I spent half my meeting with the Chinese ambassador talking about beef access into China. In addition, we are pushing to get access into both the United States and Canada this year. We are expanding the spread of beef markets that we can access and we have a mature and street-wise group of companies that can take advantage when those markets open. I agree with Deputy McNamara. We need to have an alternative outlet for farmers, the primary producers, if they feel they are not getting a fair price from the factories here in Ireland, and that is where live cattle exports come in. However, my preference would be that we would minimise live cattle exports. It needs to be there as an option, but what we want is to be getting a good price here in Ireland and employing people in processing and adding value to meat here before it is exported. That is where the maximum dividend is. As many farmers would say, however, it is important to have a live cattle export trade to keep factories honest. There is a specific issue around beef prices in the United Kingdom versus Ireland. That is because the UK has become a separate market to the rest of the European Union in terms of prices. Last year we were at 106% of EU beef prices, which is unusual. Up until a couple of years ago, we would have been probably below 95%. Irish beef is selling at a premium across the European Union, above the price of most other European beef. That is not the case in the UK because consumers there are choosing UK beef and are willing to pay more for it. We have a particular issue with that in terms of labelling, etc. This problem is not simply solved by a live cattle export trade to the UK because factories in the UK do not want to kill Irish animals. They want to kill British animals and label them as British beef. They want to import Irish beef and label that as Irish beef. With Irish-reared and British-slaughtered beef there is a confusing message on the label which is not what retailers want. There is an issue here that we are trying to address as best we can. There is also an issue with new restrictions that are being introduced in terms of slaughtering in Northern Ireland of animals that have been reared south of the Border, which is another issue. On the specifics of the bull beef issue which I accept is a big issue for farmers, 20% of our specialist beef is bull beef and we need to find an outlet for that. I will do what I can to work with the factories to facilitate a more acceptable solution than is currently available for farmers but I cannot perform miracles. There is ultimately a marketplace that decides here what it wants and what it is willing to pay for.

According to The Connaught Telegraph, a report commissioned by the HSE conducted by the Dublin-based firm, Health Partnership, is examining maternity services in the west-northwest hospitals group. The initial first draft of the report is recommending closure of the units at Castlebar, Sligo and Roscommon, and the centralisation of maternity services into University Hospital Galway and Letterkenny General Hospital. As the Minister can imagine, that has caused considerable distress so the matter needs to be clarified urgently. The HSE has confirmed that the review is under way but has still not made any report. The HSE subsequently said that there was a preliminary report. The HSE has issued a number of different press statements, so maybe that can be clarified. There was a preliminary report but this recommendation was not included in it.  I am asking the Minister to clarify a number of issues. In 2012, the last year for which I have full figures, Mayo General Hospital had 1,788 births. It is a busy maternity unit. The Minister knows the geography of Mayo well and his roots are there. A round trip to Galway from Belmullet or Erris is over 300 miles. Some weeks ago, somebody travelling from Achill experienced a difficulty and had to go to their local GP who, luckily enough, had the skills to deliver a child in Mulranny. The geographic difficulties are significant in the area and there is a need for access to maternity services. Mayo General Hospital provides a quality service in its busy maternity unit. The staff in the unit are renowned for their excellent work. They are deeply caring and there is a huge level of community trust in their abilities, as there is in the other hospitals.  How many reports are there and will the Minister publish the preliminary report? What are the terms of reference for the overall examination and will the Minister publish them? What level of public consultation will there be with GPs and local representatives? What is the date for this report to be delivered?

The worst thing one can have is speculation started by leaks, which is suddenly taken as being the truth. I firmly believe that is the case here. The suggestion that Mayo General Hospital, Portiuncula and Sligo will have their maternity units closed is totally off the wall. I have spoken to many people who have attended those maternity units and they have nothing but praise for the care and attention they received from staff. As Deputy Calleary has said, there were over 1,700 births in Mayo General Hospital in 2012 - a figure that has grown from 1,200 at the turn of the millennium. The size of County Mayo is relevant also. In recent times we have centralised many services at Mayo General Hospital, including the renal dialysis unit, which means that patients can be treated in Castlebar rather than having to travel to Galway. I presume that there is absolutely no truth in the latest report but it needs to be nailed now. We have heard a lot of good stories about Mayo General Hospital, including treatment for renal dialysis and cystic fibrosis. In addition, there are plans for palliative care between the Mayo-Roscommon hospice in conjunction with the HSE. Only yesterday, the hospital was named as one of the top performers in meeting targets for treating people in accident and emergency within nine hours. This is despite the fact that the hospital has taken extra patients as a result of the accident and emergency unit closing down in Roscommon. By any measure, Mayo General Hospital has performed well. It is important, however, that this matter is not made into a political football. We do need these matters to be clarified.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	I welcome the opportunity to provide reassurance regarding the future delivery of high quality and safe maternity services in the west of Ireland. I thank both Deputies for having raised this issue. Recent reports appear to suggest that some hospitals within the west-northwest group, including Mayo General Hospital, are to lose their maternity services. These reports are purely speculative and, as such, unhelpful. I fully recognise that such unsubstantiated reports are a cause for concern for patients and staff, and I regret any upset which may have been caused. Maternity services in the west-northwest hospitals group are under review but, let me be clear, no decisions on reconfiguration will be taken in that context. The position is that the review arises from the implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar. In addition, the Higgins report on the establishment of hospital groups, requires that each hospital group prepare a strategic plan for service configuration, consistent with national objectives for the delivery of patient services. These reports provide the backdrop for the review currently under way in each hospital in the west-northwest hospitals group, including the maternity units at Mayo General Hospital, University Hospital Galway, Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe, Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital. The review is in the early stages and will take some months to complete. Maternity services in all parts of the country will be subject to review and evaluation this year as part of the development by my Department of a new national maternity strategy. The development of this strategy is currently under way and will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure that women in Ireland have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs. It is the intention to publish the strategy this year. Deputies can be assured that any decision on maternity service reconfiguration will be considered in the context of the national strategy and, therefore, on a national rather than a local basis. No decisions on service reconfiguration will be implemented without the agreement of my Department and certainly not in advance of the publication of the proposed national maternity strategy. Developing the strategy will provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided to women and their babies. The strategy will ensure that our services are fit for purpose and in accordance with best available national and international evidence well into the future.

I accept that no decision on reconfiguration will be taken in a regional context, but the Minister is opening up the reconfiguration issue in a national context. What stage is this national maternity review at and what is the timeline? Will it be delivered in the Minister's time in office? What are its terms of reference? The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, said that on his watch, and that of the Taoiseach, nothing will happen to maternity services at Mayo General Hospital. Given the strong track record, level of throughput and excellence of care both there, in Sligo and in the other hospitals concerned, can the Minister give a guarantee on maternity services in the context of this review?

I welcome any reviews that will increase or improve on the already great care that is provided in Mayo General Hospital. I have seen at first hand the wonderful care that is given. Unless we nail it now, this kind of scaremongering is damaging for staff morale as well as causing worry for expectant mothers. It is totally at odds with what we are hearing on the ground from our constituents about the care that is provided. A family member of mine who is working abroad will be flying back to Ireland to have her baby at Mayo General Hospital in the next few months. We need to ensure that maternity services will continue at that hospital.

The Department will oversee the development of the strategy, which will be informed by our national expertise as well as international expertise and analysis of maternity and gynaecological service configurations. The project is currently being scoped and it is expected to be published later this year.

In December 2011, I announced new management arrangements for two groups of hospitals in the west and midwest, Galway University Hospital, incorporating Merlin Park, and Portiuncula, Ballinasloe and Roscommon hospitals, were placed within a single management structure led by a single chief executive officer, Mr. Bill Maher, who is responsible for group performance. The hospital group has a single clinical governance model, one budget and one employment ceiling. We are trying to devolve as much authority as possible locally in respect of budgets, staffing and recruitment. However, no local review will supplant the national maternity review and no local decisions can be in conflict with national policy. National policy will determine matters. Mayo General Hospital joined this group. I agree with Deputy John O'Mahony that this scaremongering is unhelpful and undermines confidence in the hospital and the staff. A great service is available in Mayo General Hospital, in particular, and in the other hospitals and it is one they have every right to be proud of. I am here to reassure people that there is no plan to close maternity hospitals.

Tá sé i gceist go dtiocfaidh an tUasal Ó Domhnaill i gcomharbacht ar an gCoimisinéir Teanga reatha, an tUasal Seán Ó Cuirreáin, atá ag éirí as oifig ar 23 Feabhra 2014, tar éis deich mbliana a chaitheamh san oifig sin. Is oifig reachtúil neamhspleách é Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bunaíodh sa bhliain 2004 faoi alt 20 d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 chun monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm an Achta. Is é Uachtarán na hÉireann a cheapann an Coimisinéir Teanga ar chomhairle an Rialtais tar éis do Thithe an Oireachtais rún a rith ag moladh an cheapacháin. Maireann téarma oifige an Choimisinéara Teanga ar feadh sé bliana. Is féidir é nó í a athcheapadh don dara téarma nó do théarmaí eile ina dhiaidh sin. Leagtar amach feidhmeanna an Choimisinéara Teanga faoin Acht mar seo a leanas: faireachán a dhéanamh ar chomhlíonadh an Achta ag comhlachtaí poiblí; gach beart riachtanach atá faoi réim a údaráis nó a húdaráis a dhéanamh chun a chinntiú go gcomhlíonfaidh comhlachtaí poiblí forálacha an Achta; imscrúduithe a dhéanamh, cibé acu ar a thionscnamh nó ar a tionscnamh féin, ar iarraidh ón Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta nó de bhun gearán, i gcás ina líomhnaítear go bhfuil teipthe ar chomhlacht poiblí a dhualgas a chomhlíonadh faoin Acht; comhairle a sholáthar don phobal maidir lena gcearta faoin Acht; comhairle a sholáthar do chomhlachtaí poiblí maidir lena ndualgais faoin Acht; agus imscrúduithe a dhéanamh, cibé acu ar a thionscnamh nó ar a tionscnamh féin, ar iarraidh ón Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta nó de bhun gearán, i gcás ina líomhnaítear nach bhfuil foráil d'aon achtachán eile a bhaineann le stádas nó le húsáid na Gaeilge á chomhlíonadh. Tá sé de dhualgas ar an gCoimisinéir Teanga faoin Acht tuarascáil bhliantúil faoi obair Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a sholáthar don Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta le leagan os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais; agus cuntais bhliantúla faoi chaiteachas Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a chur faoi bhráid an Ard-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste agus a sholáthar don Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta le leagan os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais. Baineann na dualgais agus na cearta seo ar fad le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bhfuil sé mar phríomhaidhm aige a chinntiú go mbeidh seirbhísí poiblí ar fáil níos fairsinge trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh caighdeán níos airde ag baint leo. Mar is eol do Theachtaí, tá athbhreithniú déanta ag mo Roinn ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla i gcomhréir leis an ghealltanas a tugadh i gclár an Rialtais. Ba í an aidhm a bhí leis an athbhreithniú ná a chinntiú go bhfuil caiteachas ar an nGaeilge dírithe ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí ar fhorbairt na teanga agus go bhfuil dualgais á gcur i bhfeidhm go cuí ag brath ar éileamh ó shaoránaigh. Mar thoradh ar an athbhreithniú, tá na cinn do Bhille na dteangacha oifigiúla (leasú) 2014 dréachtaithe. Tá mé ag súil go dtabharfar os comhair an Rialtais go luath iad. Tá sé i gceist na cinn a fhoilsiú ansin agus iad a thabhairt os comhair an Chomhchoiste um Chomhshaol, Iompar, Chultúr agus an Ghaeltacht. Tá sé i gceist chomh maith torthaí an phróisis chomhairliúcháin phoiblí, a reáchtáil mo Roinn, a fhoilsiú i dteannta le cinn an Bhille. Tógadh cinneadh Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a chónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman mar chuid de réimse gníomhartha athchóirithe faoi phlean athchóirithe an Rialtais don tseirbhís phoiblí a foilsíodh i mí na Samhna 2011. Tá sé beartaithe an cónascadh seo a chur i bhfeidhm trí Bhille na dteangacha oifigiúla (leasú) 2014. Faoin chónascadh, coimeádfaidh an Coimisinéir Teanga a chumhachtaí neamhspleácha faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla agus leanfaidh Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga ag feidhmiú ó cheannáras atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht. Is gné lárnach d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla iad na scéimeanna teanga a dhaingnítear le comhlachtaí poiblí chun líon agus caighdeán na seirbhísí poiblí a chuirtear ar fáil a mhéadú ar bhealach eagraithe agus tomhaiste thar thréimhse ama. Is é Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a dhéanann monatóireacht ar fheidhmiú na scéimeanna teanga. Tá tuairim is 200 comhlacht poiblí clúdaithe faoin 113 scéim reatha atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair. Tá plé gníomhach ar siúl ag mo Roinn, ar a bhfuil an fhreagracht scéimeanna a dhaingniú, le breis agus 120 comhlacht poiblí faoi láthair chun scéimeanna teanga nua a aontú nó scéimeanna atá i bhfeidhm cheana a athnuachan. Aithním nach bhfuil córas na scéimeanna gan laigí agus go mbaineann dúshláin ar leith le scéimeanna a chur i bhfeidhm. Aithním chomh maith an comhoibriú agus an dea-thoil atá le sonrú i measc na gcomhlachtaí poiblí éagsúla agus iad ar a ndícheall na seirbhísí i nGaeilge atá á gcur ar fáil acu a fheabhsú. Beidh céimeanna chun feabhas a chur ar an bpróiseas i gcoitinne sonraithe sna leasuithe reachtúla atá beartaithe don Acht. Tá an cumas atá ag comhlachtaí poiblí seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a sholáthar ag brath go mór ar na hacmhainní cuí a bheith ar fáil chuige sin, acmhainní daonna ach go háirithe. Tá an cheist maidir le hearcaíocht daoine le cumas Gaeilge i gcomhair post sa tseirbhís phoiblí lárnach don phlé seo. Ní haon ionadh é go bhfuil an cheist seo go mór i mbéal an phobail le tamall anuas. Tá sé tráthúil mar sin léargas a thabhairt ar na bearta atá tógtha ag an Rialtas chun cur leis an líon daoine sa Státseirbhís a mbeidh sé ar a gcumas feidhmiú go héifeachtach ar bhonn dhátheangach. Is aidhm lárnach pholasaí de chuid an Rialtais é úsáid na Gaeilge. Tá sé ina ghné thábhachtach den pholasaí sin go mbeadh baill foirne atá inniúil sa Ghaeilge ar fáil sa Státseirbhís. Ceaptar gurb é an bealach is fearr chun an aidhm pholasaí seo a bhaint amach ná trí chur chuige níos spriocdhírithe a úsáid chun a chinntiú go mbeidh foireann leis na scileanna riachtanacha Gaeilge ar fáil chun seirbhísí a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge nuair a theastaíonn sin. Ceapadh scéim de mharcanna bónais don Ghaeilge beagnach 40 bliain ó shin. Glactar leis go coitianta nach bhfuil mórán déanta ag an ionstraim pholasaí seo chun feabhas a chur ar sholáthar seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge sa Státseirbhís. Mar gheall air sin agus mar thoradh ar chinntí a thóg an Rialtas i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 2013, tá na bearta seo a leanas chun teacht in áit an pholasaí de mharcanna bónais a tugadh as inniúlacht sa Ghaeilge. Tá an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe ag iarraidh ar Ranna agus ar oifigí sainaithint a dhéanamh ar phoist agus ar réimsí oibre ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge mar chuid den phróiseas pleanála don fhórsa oibre. Táthar ag iarraidh ar Ranna aird ar leith a thabhairt ar phoist atá lonnaithe i gceantair Ghaeltachta nó a dhéanann freastal ar na ceantair sin. Beidh an próiseas seo lárnach i gcinntiú go ndéanfar foráil dóthanach i gcomórtais earcaíochta amach anseo do cheapacháin i bpoist ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge. Ina theannta sin, sonrófar na poist sin ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge i scéimeanna teanga amach anseo faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003. Mar chéad chéim sa chomórtas earcaíochta d'oifigigh feidhmiúcháin atá ar na bacáin i láthair na huaire, tá sé i gceist fo-phainéal de dhaoine le Gaeilge a bhunú nach rachaidh thar 6% den phainéal iomlán. Déanfar measúnú ar thoradh an chomórtais sin chun an t-éileamh atá ar oifigigh le Gaeilge ar fud na Státseirbhíse a mheas. Má tá an toradh sin dearfach, tá sé i gceist an socrú seo a chur i bhfeidhm de réir mar is cuí d'earcaíocht amach anseo agus d'arduithe céime i ngráid neamhspeisialtóra sa Státseirbhís. Chun feabhas a chur ar inniúlacht Ghaeilge na Státseirbhíseach atá ann faoi láthair agus chun feabhas a chur ar sholáthar seirbhísí i nGaeilge, tá sé i gceist córas nua do thástáil inniúlachta a chur i bhfeidhm faoina bhféadfar Státseirbhísigh atá ann faoi láthair a shannadh do phoist shonracha ina dteastaíonn oifigigh le Gaeilge, mar a shainaithnítear sin i scéimeanna teanga atá aontaithe faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003. Déanfaidh Ranna éascaíocht do Státseirbhísigh chun freastal ar chúrsaí oiliúna i nGaeilge agus chun scrúduithe a dhéanamh faoin gcreat náisiúnta cáilíochtaí nó faoi theastas Eorpach na Gaeilge. Beidh an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta freagrach as na córais nua oiliúna agus inniúlachta a chur i bhfeidhm faoi théarmaí an chomhaontaithe seirbhíse a aontaíodh leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe anuraidh. Creidim gur céim sa treo ceart é an polasaí seo. Don chéad uair le 40 bliain anuas, cuirfear córas úr i bhfeidhm faoina ndéanfar cuóta sonrach de phoist a shocrú chun daoine le cumas sa Ghaeilge a earcú don Státseirbhís. Ciallaíonn cur i bhfeidhm an pholasaí nua seo fosta go bhfuil ceann de bhearta tábhachtacha na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge á chur i gcrích. Moladh sa straitéis go ndéanfar díriú isteach ar an leibhéal earcaíochta i gcomhthéacs na faidhbe seo. Tá obair an-fhiúntach curtha i gcrích ag Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga le deich mbliana anuas. Glacaim buíochas arís le Seán Ó Cuirreáin agus le foireann a oifige as a saothar díograiseach i gcaitheamh na mblianta sin. Is mian liom an deis seo a thapú fosta gach rath a ghuí ar Sheán agus a theaghlach sna blianta amach romhainn. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tUasal Rónán Ó Domhnaill tar éis glacadh leis an ainmniúchán don phost mar Choimisinéir Teanga úr. Roghnaíodh é as measc 21 duine a rinne léiriú spéise i gcomhair an cheapacháin chuig an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do gach duine dóibh a rinne léiriú spéise sa phost seo. Is de bhunadh Ghaeltacht an Cheathrú Rua i gContae na Gaillimhe é an tUasal Ó Domhnaill ó dhúchas. Tá taithí leitheadach aige ar an Státchóras trína phost mar chomhfhreagraí polaitíochta le Nuacht RTÉ agus TG4 le seacht mbliana anuas. Ón aithne atá agam ar Rónán Ó Domhnaill, agus déarfainn ón aithne atá ag muintir an Tí seo ar Rónán Ó Domhnaill de thairbhe a chuid oibre, a phearsantacht agus a phroifisiúntacht mar chomhfhreagraí anseo le blianta anuas, sílim go nguífidh gach éinne gach rath agus sonas air sa phost atá á thairiscint dó. Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh tacaíocht gach duine san Oireachtas le fáil ag Rónán Ó Domhnaill nuair a bheidh a ainm á chur ar aghaidh chuig an Uachtarán lena cheapadh mar Choimisinéir Teanga. Sílim go gcuirfidh sé a shéala féin ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta sa tír seo. Molaim a ainm go hard don Teach.

Tagann Rónán Ó Domhnaill ón gCeathrú Rua i nGaeltacht Chonamara. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, d'oibrigh sé mar iriseoir ar son Nuacht RTÉ agus TG4 i dTeach Laighean le blianta anuas. D'oibrigh sé freisin ar chlár teilifíse RTÉ, "The Week in Politics". Caithfidh mé buíochas a ghabháil le Seán Ó Cuirreáin, an coimisinéir atá ag éirí as, as ucht an méid oibre atá déanta aige. Chuala mé Seán Ó Cuirreáin ag caint ag dhá chruinniú Oireachtais. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, ní raibh sé sásta le polasaithe an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge. Cheap sé nach raibh na moltaí a bhí á ndéanamh aige á gcur i gcrích ag an Rialtas. Beidh na fadhbanna céanna ag an gcoimisinéir nua muna n-athraíonn lucht an Rialtais na polasaithe atá acu. Thuig Seán Ó Cuirreáin gur beag eile a d'fhéadfadh sé a bhaint amach go pearsanta i dtaca le cearta teanga phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta sa dhá bhliain a bheadh fágtha aige sa phost. Ar ndóigh, bhí díomá air gur cheap sé go mbeadh sé níos fearr gan an dá bhliain a chaitheamh sa phost. Bhíomar ag súil le dul chun cinn nuair a tháinig Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla isteach. Tá méadú tagtha ar an tuiscint atá againn ar chearta teanga. Tá Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga ag tabhairt tacaíochta don tuiscint sin. Ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh an tAire Stáit an scéal dúinn faoin mhéid gur féidir leis a dhéanamh chun níos mó Státseirbhísigh le Gaeilge a cheapadh. Ba cheart seirbhísí Stáit a sholáthar trí Ghaeilge gan cheist gan choinníoll. Ní bheadh mórán costais ag baint leis sin, go háirithe ós rud é go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur níos mó daoine ar fáil sa Státseirbhís. Dúirt an Coimisinéir Teanga ag na cruinnithe ar a d'fhreastal mé go bhfuil níos mó ná dhá bhliain caite ag déanamh athbhreithnithe ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla gan chinn an Bhille curtha chun cinn go fóill. B'fhéidir gó mbeidh an tAire in ann a rá cathain a bheidh na leasuithe sin ullamh. Dúirt sé ina ráiteas go mbeidh siad linn "go luath". An mbeidh na leasuithe fhoilsithe roimh an samhradh? Is ceist an-tábhachtach í sin dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.Labhair an tAire Stáit faoin gcinneadh Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga a chónascadh le hOifig an Ombudsman. Tá sé soiléir go dtógadh an cinneadh seo dhá bhliain ó shin i ngan fhios don dá oifig. Níos mó ná dhá bhliain níos déanaí, níl a fhios ag éinne conas a n-oibreoidh an oifig nua. Deirtear go mbeidh an cónascadh déanta roimh mhí Mheán Fómhair. Caithfidh Oifig an Chomisinéara Teanga na hacmhainní riachtanacha a fháil chun a chuid oibre a chomhlíonadh. Ní féidir le haon choimisinéir iomarca muiníne a bheith aige nó aici sa chóras nua pleanála teanga atá beartaithe faoi Acht na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom caint faoi Lá Mór na Gaeilge, a tharla i mBaile Átha Cliath Dé Sathairn seo caite. Bhí daoine ag máirseáil ó Chearnóg Phamell go dtí Sráid Chill Dara, os comhair Theach Laighean. Bhí pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ó Thuaidh agus ó Dheas ag iarraidh cothrom na féinne a fháil. Tá sé i gceist go mbeadh seirbhísí Stáit ar fáil don phobal, go háirithe sa Ghaeltacht, trí mheán na Gaeilge ar chomhchaighdeán agus ar chomhchéim leis na seirbhísí atá ar fáil trí mheán an Bhéarla. Ócáid an-tábhachtach a bhí ann. Is mór an trua é, i gcomhthéacs na rudaí a bhí á rá ag Lá Mór na Gaeilge agus na rudaí a mhol Seán Ó Cuirreáin, nach bhfuil an Rialtas ó Dheas ag tabhairt tacaíochta do chearta teanga phobal na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge. Luaigh Comhairle na hEorpa i dtuairisc a d'fhoilsigh siad ar 14 Eanáir seo caite go bhfuil cosc á chur le fás agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i dTuaisceart Éireann mar thoradh ar an dearcadh i leith na teanga i Stormont, go háirithe an easpa tacaíochta dá húsáid sna cúirteanna agus i gcúrsaí oideachais. De réir bileog a sheol Conradh na Gaeilge chugainn, tá siad ag iarraidh ar pholaiteoirí ó Thuaidh agus ó Dheas todhchaí a roghnú don teanga agus nithe áirithe a dhéanamh: seirbhísí Stáit as Gaeilge a chinntiú do phobal na Gaeltachta gan cheist gan choinníoll faoi dheireadh 2016, seirbhísí Stáit a chur ar fáil as Gaeilge do phobal na Gaeilge ar chomhchaighdeán leis na seirbhísí as Béarla; Acht Gaeilge cuimsitheach ceartbhunaithe a achtú ó Thuaidh; Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a láidriú i mbliana; deireadh a chur leis an maolú ar stádas na Gaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil den Aontas Eorpach; agus an pobal Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a aithint mar gheallsealbhóirí i gcur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain don Ghaeilge ó Dheas agus sa straitéis don Ghaeilge ó Thuaidh. Mar a dúirt Conradh na Gaeilge, is le gach éinne an teanga. Creideann siad go gcaithfear an deis agus an ceart sin - an teanga a labhairt - a thabhairt do na daoine a roghnaíonn í a úsáid. Bhí daoine ag caint ag Lá Mór na Gaeilge Dé Sathairn seo caite faoi thacaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Bhí na focail "táimid dearg le fearg" scríofa ar na bratacha a bhí ag daoine ag an máirseáil sin - ar ndóigh, bhí an áit dearg le bratacha freisin. Bhuail mé le bean ó Chontae Mhaigh Eo a dúirt liom - tá sé seo sna nuachtáin - "if you send the HSE an e-mail in Irish you'll get a response in English and that says it all really". Ní dóigh liom gur cheart go bhfaigheadh duine le Gaeilge ón nGaeltacht a leithéid de fhreagra. Ceapann a lán daoine go bhfuil an teanga faoin ionsaí. D'fhéadfainn ceisteanna eile, a bhaineann le cearta daonna agus leis an daonlathas, a lua sa chomhthéacs seo. Ní bhfuair muintir na Gaeltachta seans vóta a chaitheamh d'iarrthóirí Údarás na Gaeltachta ós rud é gur cuireadh na toghcháin ar ceal. Tá gearradh siar déanta ar airgead an údaráis cé go bhfuil méadú tagtha ar líon na ndífhostaithe sa tír seo, an Ghaeltacht san áireamh. Tá amhras ar dhaoine faoi thodhchaí na seirbhísí farantóireachta agus aeir go dtí na hoileáin. Cuirim fáilte roimh an airgead atá á sholáthar ag an Aire Stáit don straitéis 20 bliain. Fáiltím freisin roimh an obair atá á déanamh ag Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4. An rud is mó a ghoileann orm - bhí sé seo soiléir Dé Sathairn seo caite - ná nach bhfuil daoine in ann a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Tá gealltanas déanta go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an bhfadhb seo roimh 2016. Thug Conradh na Gaeilge le tuiscint ag an deireadh seachtaine gur féidir a rá nach bhfuil gá le Acht teanga, ós rud é go bhfuil sé seo clúdaithe sa Bhunreacht, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh Acht nua againn ar aon nós. Cuirim fáilte arís roimh ainmniúcháin Rónán Ó Domhnaill. Tá súil agam go mbeidh Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga fós neamhspleách agus láidir. Tá súil agam nach ndéanfaí aon mhaolú ar stádas na Gaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil den Aontas Eorpach tar éis 1 Eanáir 2016. Níor cheart go mbeadh aon laghdú eile ar bhuiséad Údarás na Gaeltachta, ar bhuiséad Foras na Gaeltachta nó ar bhuiséad Roinn na Gaeltachta. Ba cheart go mbeadh na mbuiséid sin méadaithe de réir a chéile. Cuirim fáilte arís roimh an gcoimisinéir nua. Tá súil agam go mbeidh obair fhiúntach á déanamh aige.

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Seán Ó Cuirreáin as an obair iontach a rinne sé le linn na tréimhse a chaith sé mar Choimisinéir Teanga. Is laoch díograiseach é. Is mór an trua go bhfuil sé imithe ón bpost seo. Ba mhaith liom freisin fáilte a chur roimh an gCoimisinéir Teanga nua, Rónán Ó Domhnaill. Tá aithne agam air agus aithním an méid oibre atá déanta aige sna meáin chumarsáide le blianta anuas. Is fear cumasach é. Is ardfhear é. Tá mé lán cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall a chuid dualgais a chomhlíonadh. Caithfidh mé a rá, áfach, go bhfuil mé buartha go ndéanfaidh an Rialtas iarracht bac a chur ar a chuid iarrachtaí, díreach mar a rinne siad i gcás an iar-choimisinéara. Táimid ag maireachtáil i dtréimhse uafásach phráinneach don teanga. Tá doras na Gaeilge ag dúnadh ag an bhomaite. Tá 3,000 bliain de stair, cultúr, eolas, ealaín, smaoineamh, fealsúnacht agus féiniúlacht sa tír seo ag teacht chun deiridh fad is atá an Aire Stáit ag faire amach. Tá sé ráite go bhfuil an cuma ar an scéal go mbeidh an ghlúin seo an ghlúin dheireanach ina mbeidh an teanga beo i measc an phobail timpeall na tíre. Nuair a tháinig an t-eolas seo chun cinn ó thaighde a rinneadh thar tréimhse chúig bliana, socraíodh gur cheart an straitéis 20 bliain a chur le chéile. De réir an taighde, b'fhéidir go bhfuil 15 bliain fágtha ag an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail. Tá an straitéis 20 bliain foilsithe, ach níl sí á cur i bhfeidhm ag an Rialtas. Níl riachtanas ar bith sa straitéis - braitheann sé ar toil an Rialtais. Tá sé ráite ag Seán Ó Cuirreáin nach fiú tráithnín féir aon straitéis mura gcuirtear i bhfeidhm í. Conas a bhfuil ag éirí leis an Rialtas sa chomhthéacs seo? Bíonn an tAire, an Teachta Deenihan, in easnamh i gcónaí nuair a bhíonn an Ghaeilge á plé. Níl guth na Gaeilge le cloisteáil ag an gcomh-aireacht ar chor ar bith. Deireann an tAire Stáit rud amháin agus déanann sé rud eile. Tá an tóin tite amach as an mbuiséad. Tá an daonlathas bainte amach as Údarás na Gaeltachta. Fiú sna háiteanna nach bhfuil airgead de dhíth chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge, níl an Rialtas ag déanamh róchabhrach. Mar a dúirt Seán Ó Cuirreáin, caitheann saoránaigh na tíre seo 14 bliain ag foghlaim na Gaeilge, ach ina dhiaidh sin tá orthu Béarla a labhairt leis na Státseirbhísigh. Níl aon rogha acu. Fiú nuair atá rialacha ann chun daoine a earcú, níl an Státseirbhís sásta glacadh leis na rialacha sin. Nuair a dhíríonn an coimisinéir isteach ar na fadhbanna sin, níl an Rialtas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt dó chun iad a réiteach. Ní chosnaíonn oibrithe le Gaeilge níos mó ná oibrithe le Béarla. I mo thuairim, eachtra uafásach a bhí ann nuair a sheas an Coimisinéir Teanga síos. Ba é an chéad uair riamh sa tír seo gur sheas Ombudsman siar. Nuair a tháinig Seán Ó Cuirreáin isteach go dtí an tOireachtas cúpla seachtain ó shin chun a chuid cleachtaidh agus a chuid tuairimí a roinnt linn, ní raibh ball den Rialtas ar bith sásta freastal ar an gcruinniú sin. Bhí an tOmbudsman ann, ach ní raibh éinne ó Fhine Gael nó Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre i láthair. Léiríonn sé sin masla uafásach do Sheáin Uí Chuirreáin. Léiríonn sé sin masla uafásach don Ghaeltacht agus do mhuintir na Gaeilge timpeall na tíre. Bhí mé ag an mhórshiúl an deireadh seachtaine seo caite. Mar a dúirt na daoine a ghlac páirt san ócáid sin, tá fearg uafásach ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar mhuintir na Gaeilge de bharr na ndrochrudaí atá an Rialtas seo ag déanamh don teanga.

Is mór an trua nach raibh sé sásta fanacht sa phost, go dtí deireadh a réime. Gan amhras, bhí díomá air maidir leis an tslí atá rudaí ag dul, ní hamháin leis an Rialtas ach leis an Státchóras. Tá dul chun cinn mór déanta timpeall na tíre, sa Deisceart agus sa Tuaisceart. I mo cheantar féin, tá na scoileanna, Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin i bhFionnghlas agus Scoil an tSeachtar Laoch, i mBaile Munna, ag fás go tapaidh agus tá scuaine fada ar an liosta feithimh le dul isteach iontu. Tá scoileanna tríú leibhéal de dhíth i mo cheantar agus timpeall na tíre. Tá daoine ag lorg oideachais níos leithne trí Ghaeilge agus ag lorg coláistí le gach ábhar trí Ghaeilge ar an gcuraclam. Níl go leor daoine agus Gaeilge acu á úsáid go rialta, fiú sna Gaeltachtaí agus is sin an dúshlán atá os comhair an fhir nua, Rónán Ó Domhnaill, agus ár sochaí. Tá cáil ar Rónán Ó Domhnaill mar fhear macánta, díograsach agus an-ábalta ar fad. Cuirim fáilte roimhe agus é ag dul i mbun a phoist nua. Tá sé le feiceáil go bhfuil daoine sa Státchóras a thacaíonn go láidir leis an nGaeilge, ach tá fórsaí níos láidre agus níos forleithne ann ar an mheon gur cuma leo faoinár dteanga náisiúnta. Tá ár dteanga in ainm a bheith ar an leibhéal céanna le Béarla, ach níl sin le feiceáil. Teanga gan phobal, is teanga gan anam í. Níl go leor daoine le cumas Gaeilge sa chóras riaracháin phoiblí agus níl an toil ann athrú a dhéanamh chun déileáil leis an bhfadhb seo. Rinne saineolaí áirithe staidéar cuimsitheach teangeolaíoch ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus dúirt sé go raibh an Ghaeilge níos imeallaí ná riamh sa Stát Seirbhís. Caithfimid troid ar son ár dteanga agus caithfidh gach eagraíocht Ghaeilge obair le chéile leis an aidhm céanna a bhaint amach, ár dteanga a chur chun cinn. Ba cheart go gcuirfí níos mó béime ar labhairt na Gaeilge i scoileanna thart timpeall na tíre. Tá athrú de dhíth maidir leis an tslí a múintear Gaeilge. Tá daoine ag caitheamh blianta i scoileanna ag foghlaim, ach níl siad ábalta comhrá a bheith acu le chéile. Cén fáth gur féidir linn teanga eile a fhoghlaim, ach nach féidir linn an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim? Tá busanna ar Bhóthar na bhFál agus ceannscríbe i nGaeilge orthu. Ní raibh mé ag súil go dtarlódh seo riamh agus tá sé dochreidte go bhfuil seo ag tarlú ar Bhóthar na bhFál.  Tá dúshlán mór roimh Rónán Ó Domhnaill, ach tá dóchas ann. Féach ar an dTuaisceart agus ar an mhéid daoine ansin atá ag úsáid na teanga, gan chuidiú mhaith ó Rialtas Shasana. I mo cheantar freisin, tá daoine ag lorg Gaelscoileanna agus naíscoileanna agus tá scuaine mór ag feitheamh orthu. Tá dóchas ann don teanga agus is dóigh go n-aontódh an tAire Stáit liom faoi sin.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Ó Murchú. Tá súil agam gur thóg an Rialtas ceann ar na mílte daoine óga a bhí amuigh ar shráideanna Bhaile Átha Cliath Dé Sathairn seo caite ar mhórshiúl de chuid na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus a leithéid, i rith Lá Mór na Gaeilge. Séard a bhíodar ag lorg ná go mbeadh an Rialtas dáiríre faoi staid na Gaeilge sa tír seo. Dúirt an-chuid díobh go rabhadar dearg le fearg toisc nach gceapann siad go bhfuil sin amhlaidh. Ní cheapann siad go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre faoi chearta lucht labhartha na Gaeilge a chur i gceart. Dúirt an coimisinéir deireanach, Seán Uasal Ó Cuirreáin a d'éirigh as oifig, agus é os comhair An Comhchoiste Oireachtais um Mhaoirseacht na Seirbhíse Poiblí agus Achainíocha, go ginearálta, dóibh siúd atá gafa go gairmiúil nó go deonach le cosaint nó cur chun cinn na teanga, gur tréimhse í seo atá lán le héiginnteacht. Dúirt sé:  Ní fhaca mé in imeacht 30 bliain mar iriseoir nó mar Choimisinéir Teanga an oiread ísle brí agus lagmhisnigh, d'ainneoin tacaíocht ollmhór ag tromlach an phobail i gcoitinne sa tír don teanga. Tá sí á ruaigeadh go leanúnach chuig imeall na sochaí. Airím anseo cuid mhaith den riarachán phoiblí. Ní bheidh sé furasta í a thabhairt ar ais go háit níos lárnaí.Tá sé imníoch amach is amach go mbeadh ar Choimisinéir Teanga a leithéid a rá. Is cúis náire é don Rialtas agus do rialtais roimhe seo atá tar éis a leithéid de staid a ligean a theacht i gcrích. Ceann de na gearáin is mó, fiú amháin insan Ghaeltacht féin, ná nach féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta a gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge mar cheart choitianta. Tá an scéal mar an gceánna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Is minic go mbíonn daoine ag glaoch ar Rannaí Rialtais nó ar rannaí phobail agus go dteastaíonn uathu a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge, ach nach féidir leo mar nach bhfuil éinne ann chun labhairt leo sa teanga. Tá sin náireach amach is amach. Bíonn ar na daoine sin fanacht go dtiocfaidh duine éigin thar n-ais chucu, b'fhéidir nach sa lá céanna. Ní cheart go dtarlódh sé sin in aon tír maidir le gnáth theanga an phobail, pé acu Béarla nó Gaeilge sa tír seo. Caithfear achmhainní a chur isteach chun an cheist seo a athrú. Maidir le staid na Gaeilge, ar ndóigh tá comhthéacs níos leithne anseo. Tá an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta sa tír seo ag bánú na nGaeltachtaí agus tá polasaithe déine an Rialtais agus na ciorruithe sa chaiteachas phoiblí agus seirbhísí phoiblí ag bánú na nGaeltachtaí. I measc na mílte postanna sa tseirbhís phoiblí atáthar tar éis ligean le sruth, bí cinnte go raibh an-chuid daoine de lucht labhartha na Gaeilge a d'fhéadfadh gnó a dhéanamh le muintir na Gaeltachta agus iad ag glaoch isteach. Dá bhrí sin, tá na polasaithe déine ag déanamh an-scrios agus an-dochar don Ghaeltacht agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá lucht óg na Gaeltachta ag imeacht as an dtír agus is mór an náire dúinn é sin. Dá bhrí sin, caithfear deireadh a chur leis na polasaithe déine agus polasaithe radacacha eacnamaíochta, polasaithe sóisialacha a chur i bhfeidhm. Mar fhocal scoir, guím gach rath ar Rónán Uasal Ó Domhnaill, ach ní bheidh éifeacht ag baint leis an oifig mura dtugtar na hacmhainní cuí agus tacaíocht oifigiúil don oifig, i dtreo agus gur féidir le daoine a gcearta a bheith acu maidir leis an dteanga go dteastaíonn uathu a labhairt go laethúil.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I am very much a product of the Irish education system. I studied Irish in primary and secondary school and I even went to the Gaeltacht on about three occasions and, much to my regret, I still could not converse in Irish. I did make a contribution to the Irish language by virtue of the fact that I sent my children to an all-Irish school so they do not have the same disadvantage as me from that point of view. I thank the outgoing Irish language commissioner for his dedication, work and obvious concern. The concern is the regret we will all have at the manner of his departure and the fact that he is pessimistic about the future of the Irish language. I also wish Rónán Ó Domhnaill all the best. He will need to see some elevated concern from the Government because there is clearly a problem. The number of people on the street on Saturday shows there is a serious issue that must be addressed. As Deputy Ellis mentioned, it is not exclusively in the Gaeltacht areas that issues arise with the Irish language. North Kildare is not an area in which one would expect to find such a problem. We have four primary schools where teaching is done through the medium of Irish, three of them in the north-east part of the county. The schools in Kilcock, Leixlip and Maynooth are very popular and have refused places to 200 pupils at primary level because they are oversubscribed. Scoil Uí Riada in Kilcock has allocated 56 places and 94 children have been refused places. Scoil Chearbhaill Uí Dhálaigh in Leixlip was established in 1979, which indicates that it is no fleeting idea. The school has allocated 64 places for September and refused 32 children. In Gaelscoil Uí Fhiaich in Maynooth 62 places have been allocated and 71 children were refused a place. There is no place for those children in secondary school. An entire class of secondary school students is being pushed towards An Aonad in Maynooth, which according to parents is a downgrading in terms of education through Irish because they want their children to be wholly educated through Irish. They understand the difference involved in being immersed in a language and being offered a few subjects in Irish. There is no shortage of people to assist in the revival of the language but there is a real problem with the necessary provision to allow that to occur. That is a very practical issue. If that position had been articulated 100 years ago when people were talking about the revival of the language and culture they would have been horrified to think that on the cusp of the centenary of a number of major events in our history we would refuse to educate children who were queuing up to be educated through Irish. We must examine dimensions of the issue that are not exclusively related to the problems that occur in the Gaeltacht. This is another missed opportunity. The children who started in the first all-Irish school in north Kildare are now parents and are sending their own children to the same school. We are into the second generation and a community has been established in the area but there is no Gaelscoil for the children to attend. The Gaelcholáiste that was built in Lucan is fully subscribed to by the two Gaelscoileanna in Lucan. A real opportunity is being missed. The information must be factored into the initiatives and a co-ordinated approach must be taken by the Government, including the Department of Education and Skills, in the provision of the opportunities that are so demonstrably absent in the areas to which I draw attention.

Is duine den chéad scoth é Rónán Ó Domhnaill. Tá an-mheas air mar iriseoir agus mar chraoltóir. Is céimí de chuid Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh é. Tá sé ag obair mar chomhfhreagraí polaitíochta le Nuacht RTÉ agus TG4 le seacht mbliana anuas. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach gur fear Gaeltachta é. Is duine stuama láidir é. Bhuail mé leis cuid mhaith uaire agus rinne mé cuid mhaith agallaimh leis. Go háirithe, tá scileanna idirphearsanta faoi leith aige. Beidh sé sin an-chabhrach dó agus an jab tábhachtach seo á dhéanamh aige. Is oifig reachtúil neamhspleách í Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, a bunaíodh sa bhliain 2004 faoi Alt 20 d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003. Is iad dualgais an choimisinéara ná faireachán a dhéanamh ar chomhlíonadh an Achta ag comhlachtaí poiblí agus gach beart riachtanach atá faoi réim a údaráis a dhéanamh chun a chinntiú go gcomhlíonfaidh comhlachtaí poiblí forálacha an Achta. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go bhfuil na dualgais sin aige. Tá sé mar aidhm ag an Rialtas go mbeidh seirbhísí poiblí ar fáil níos fairsinge trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh caighdeán níos airde ag baint leo. Tá an Rialtas lándáiríre faoi seo. Tá córas nua earcaíochta i bhfeidhm chun déileáil leis na fadhbanna atá luaite le tamall. Beidh Ranna Stáit ag scrúdú na riachtanais atá ann maidir le poist Ghaeilge sa Státseirbhís. Tá sé i gceist sa chéad chomórtas eile d'oifigigh feidhmiúcháin 6% d'fholúntais a chur ar fáil do dhaoine atá ábalta gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach. Tréaslaím leis an Aire Stáit de bharr an jab sin a dhéanamh. Tá mé an-sásta go bhfuil an tionscnamh riachtanach seo ag tarlú. Tá athbhreithniú ar siúl ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Beidh moltaí ag dul chuig an Rialtas gan mhoill. Tá sé geallta i gclár an Rialtas go ndéanfar cearta lucht na Gaeilge a chruthú ar bhealach níos éifeachtaí. Cé go bhfuil géarchéim airgeadais sa tír seo, táimid ag déanamh infheistíochta sa teanga, go háirithe sa Ghaeltacht ach freisin i ngnéithe oidhreachta agus cultúrtha na teanga. Táimid ag tabhairt tacaíochta do TG4, do Raidió na Gaeltachta agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar ba chóir go ndéanfaimid, in ainneoin go bhfuil géarchéim sa tír seo. Sílim go bhfuil sé iontach tábhachtach go gcaitheann 24,000 mic léinn tréimhse sa Ghaeltacht gach bliain. Tréaslaím leis an Aire Stáit go raibh sé in ann deontas na mná tí a choinneáil. D'ísligh an Rialtas deireanach an méid airgead a fhaigheann na mná tí. Tá an tAire Stáit ag cosaint an méid airgid a fhaigheann siad. Tá an-jab á dhéanamh againn leis na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge.Ba mhaith liom an tAire Stáit a mholadh as an tacaíocht a tugadh don fhoirgneamh agus d'áiseanna nua don Gaelscoil iontach atá againn i mBaile an Chábháin, atá againn le cúpla bliain anois. Tá an tAire Stáit ag dul os comhair an choiste ar 6 Márta agus táim lán sásta go mbeidh sé ábalta an coiste a shásamh go bhfuil muid ag comhlíonadh na ndualgas atá againn sa Ghaeilge agus ag iarraidh na straitéise a chur i bhfeidm. Is fear Gaeltachta é an tAire Stáit, tá a chroí sa teanga agus tá sé lán dáiríre faoin obair seo. Tá an meas céanna ag na daoine ar na binsí seo ar ár n-oidhreacht agus ar ár dteanga agus táimid dáiríre futhu, mar atá gach duine sna Tithe seo. Ba mhaith linn go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt go fairsing sa tír agus go mbeadh tacaíocht níos fearr ar fáil di. Táimid ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus nílim sásta éisteacht le daoine atá ag iarraidh muid a cháineadh as ucht sin.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	373	Tá an-áthas orm a bheith anseo ag an ainmniú oifígiúil don Choimisinéir Teanga nua, Rónán Ó Domhnaill. Tá Rónán molta ag an Rialtas don phost mar an dara Coimisinéir Teanga. Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an iar-choimisinéir, Seán Ó Cuirreáin, as ucht an obair a rinne sé le deich mbliana anuas ar son na Gaeilge. Tá dul chun cinn déanta aige ar son na Gaeilge i rith a thréimhse mar Choimisinéir Teanga, tréimhse atá ag teacht chun críche ar 23 Feabhra.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Rónán Ó Domhnaill, fear óg as mo dháilcheantar féin - Gaillimh Thiar. Is as an gCeathrú Rua é Rónán, an baile sheirbhíse don Ghaeltacht is láidre sa tír, Gaeltacht Chonamara. Cé go bhfuil sé óg, tá taithí aige sa pholaitíocht, mar iriseoir polaitíochta, agus leis na meáin chumarsáide. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann an taithí sin a úsáid ar son na teanga. Tá ról tábhachtach anois ag an gCoimisinéir Teanga nua. Rinne an t-iar-choimisinéir ráiteas ag an gComhchoiste um Chomhshaol, Cultúr agus Gaeltachta sa Dáil roimh an Nollaig agus arís an mhí seo caite. Ag éirí as an ráiteas sin, bhí feachtas ag Conradh na Gaeilge ar son na teanga i dtaobh stádas na Gaeilge sa tseirbhís phoiblí agus na fadhbanna atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus lucht na Gaeilge seirbhísí poiblí a fháil trí Gaeilge. Dúirt an t-iar-choimisinéir nach raibh sé in ann níos mó a dhéanamh ina phost chun seirbhísí a fheabhsú ar son lucht na Gaeilge agus, mar sin, go raibh sé chun dul ar scor. Caithfidh mé a rá nár thosaigh na fadhbanna sin i Mí Márta 2011 nuair a tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht. Bhí fadhbanna ann i bhfad roimhe sin.  Ghlac an Rialtas seo le moltaí a bhí leagtha amach sa straitéis 20 bliain agus tá dul chun cinn déanta le cuid acu. Tá na pleananna do na limistéir Ghaeltachta ag dul ar aghaidh - tá plean i bhfeidhm i gceantar Chois Fhairrge, i mo dháilcheantar. Tá an scéim nua chun tacú le haon chlann atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge sa bhaile, an clár tacaíochta teaghlaigh i bhfeidhm chomh maith. Ach tá níos mó le déanamh fos. Tá a fhios ag daoine go mbeidh gardaí ag teacht ar ais go dtí Teampall Mór i mbliana, i ndiaidh an choláiste traenála a bheith dúnta le roinnt blianta. Chuir mé síos ceist pharlaiminteach an tseachtain seo caite don Aire Dlí agus Cirt agus Comhionannais, an Teachta Shatter, agus d'fhiafraigh mé dó an mbeadh cuóta ag Coimisinéir an Gharda Síochána maidir le cainteoirí Gaeilge, mar go bhfuil cuspóir sa straitéis 20 bliain faoi ról na Gaeilge sa Gharda Síochána. Dúirt an tAire go raibh Coimisinéir an Gharda Síochána sásta go mbeadh cainteoirí líofa sa Ghaeilge aige san earcaíocht nua seo. Maidir le caighdeán na Gaeilge sa tseirbhís phoiblí, chuir eagraíochtaí Gaeilge milleán ar Rialtas 1973-77, a rinne cinneadh deireadh a chur leis na coinníollacha gur gá Gaeilge a bheith ag gach duine le dul isteach sa seirbhís phoiblí. Ach cén fáth nár athraigh aon Rialtas na coinníollacha sin ó 1974? An raibh sé deacair daoine a fháil le caighdeán maith i nGaeilge, b'fhéidir mar gheall ar chaighdeán labhartha na Gaeilge nó mar gheall ar an gcaoi a mhúintear í? Tá plean ag an Rialtas é sin a athrú agus tá súil agam go mbeidh feabhas ar na figiúirí sna blianta amach romhainn. Leag an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich, plean le cuóta a shocrú le daoine le cumas sa Ghaeilge a earcú don Státseirbhís. Is maith an rud é sin. Seo an chéad uair le 40 bliain anuas go bhfuil cuóta nua mar sin leagtha amach. Labhair mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Joe O' Reilly, faoin mhéid atá déanta. Is maith an rud, mar shampla, nach raibh aon ghearradh siar ar na rátaí do mhná tí i mbliana, cé gur ghearr an t-iar rialtas siar ar an mhéid a bhí ar fáil do mhná tí. Tá díospóireacht ag teastáil maidir le stádas na Gaeilge. Ba cheart freisin go mbeadh leathuair nó uair an chloig againn gach lá sa Teach seo ina mbeadh an díospóireacht ar fad trí Ghaeilge. Ba chóir mar sin go mbeadh díospóireacht againn faoi stádas na Gaeilge. Is í an teanga oifigiúil agus caithfidh muid í a chur chun cinn gach uair is féidir. Tá a fhios agam go mbíonn lá againn ar a mbíonn díospóireachtaí as Gaeilge againn, thart ar Sheachtain na Gaeilge nó Lá Fhéile Pádraig, ach tá níos mó ná sin ag teastáil. Labhair an Teachta O'Reilly faoi na Gaelscoileanna chomh maith. Tá an-dul chun cinn déanta le Gaelscoileanna ar fud na tíre agus tá siad ag dul i méid. Tá níos mó daoine anois taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ag foghlaim na teanga agus is maith sin, ach tá laghdú ar an gcaighdeán in áiteanna eile. Is mór an trua é sin, go háirithe nuair a tharlaíonn sin sa Ghaeltacht. Tá feachtas ar bun chun an teanga a mhúineadh níos fearr agus aontaím leis an méid a rinne an Rialtas agus an tiar-Rialtas maidir leis an bhéim a chur ar Ghaeilge labhartha. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an gcaighdeán dá bharr sin amach anseo.

Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Rónán Ó Domhnaill as a cheapachán mar Choimisinéir Teanga. Is duine aitheanta é Rónán i dteaghlaigh na tíre de bharr a thréimse mar iriseoir polaitiúil le RTÉ agus táim cinnte go mbeidh sé in ann caighdeáin ard a chothabháil ina phost nua. Tá ról an Choimisinéara Teanga an-tábhachtach agus tá freagracht ollmhór ag baint leis an bpost. Tá lán muinín agamsa as Rónán Ó Domhnaill agus tá a fhios agam go mbeidh sé in ann jab iontach a dhéanamh. Beidh neart dúshlán sa todhchaí don Ghaeilge agus mar náisiún, caithfimid go léir oibriú le chéile agus ár ndícheall a dhéanamh. Ní Gaeilgeoir mise nó ní as an Ghaeltacht mé, ach táim ag déanamh mo dhíchill faoi láthair chun an teanga a fhoghlaim agus a úsáid chomh minic agus is féidir liom. Níl sin simplí. Caithfimid, mar náisiún, tús a dhéanamh sa bhaile. Caithfimid tosú le páistí óga agus caithfimid ár mbeagán Gaeilge a úsáid lenár bpáistí sa bhaile. Dá ndéanfadh muid sin, bheadh muintir na tíre ar fad in ann níos mó a dhéanamh don teanga. Bhí mé i nDaingean Uí Chúis an Aoine seo caite, mar bím ann gach Aoine le haghaidh clinicí. Is mór an trua gur sin an t-aon seans a bhíonn agam i rith na seachtaine mo chuid Gaeilge a úsáid le gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.  Bhuail mé le cairde an Aoine seo caite agus bhíomar ag labhairt faoin teanga agus faoi Lá Mór na Gaeilge Dé Sathairn seo caite. Bhíomar ag plé freisin le smaointe a bhí againn maidir leis an Ghaeilge. Bhíomar ag labhairt faoi mo cheantar, An Chill, atá in aice le Caisleán na Mainge.Mar a dúirt mé, níl sé sa Ghaeltacht. Bhíomar ag rá - bhí cúpla duine ann - gur cheart dúinn iarracht a dhéanamh rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin teanga. Tá plean fadteármach againn chun an teanga a fhorbairt sa Chill agus i gCaisleán na Mainge. Chuala mé an smaoineamh nua faoi twinnings idir áiteanna Gaeltachta, cosúil le Baile na nGall, agus áiteanna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, cosúil leis An Chill agus Caisleán na Mainge. B'fhéidir go bhfuil seans againn an smaoineamh sin a fhorbairt. An bhfuil an tAire in ann rud a dhéanamh faoi sin? B'fhéidir go mbeadh seans ann áit éigin i gConamara a nascadh le háit éigin i mBaile Átha Cliath.

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an gcoimisinéir atá ag éirí as, Seán Ó Cuirreáin, as ucht an méid atá déanta aige ar son na teanga. Is maith an rud é an Ghaeilge a chloisteáil sa Teach i rith na díospóireachta seo. Tá Seachtain na Gaeilge ag teacht arís agus beidh deis againn go léir páirt a ghlacadh i Lá na Gaeilge. Ba chóir do Theachtaí ó gach páirtí iarracht níos mó a dhéanamh an teanga a úsáid san Oireachtas. Cé nach bhfuil mé i mo shaineolaí, tá an-suim agam i mo theanga dhúchasach. Tá mé sásta úsáid a bhaint as mo chuid Gaeilge nuair a bhíonn seans agam. B'fhéidir go n-aontaíonn an tAire Stáit nach bhfuil Gaeilge róláidir agam i gcomparáid leis na Teachtaí ó chontaetha ar nós Gaillimh agus Ciarraí. Ba chóir dúinn go léir an teanga a úsáid. Admhaím go bhfuil obair le déanamh agam chun feabhas a chur ar mo chuid Gaeilge. B'fhéidir go mbeidh seans ag an Aire Stáit cabhair a thabhairt dom agus mé ag iarraidh mo chumas a fheabhsú. Is léir go bhfuil fíorghrá ag an Aire Stáit don teanga agus go bhfuil sé tiomanta ina leith. Tá a dhícheall déanta aige, ón uair a tháinig sé isteach sa Dáil sa bhliain 1982, cás na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Nuair a ceapadh é mar Aire Stáit, bhí sé soiléir do gach Teachta sa Dáil, ó gach páirtí, go raibh an post sin tuillte aige. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga nua, Rónán Ó Domhnaill, agus go mbeidh an t-ádh leis. Duine den chéad scoth is ea é. Tá sé soiléir ón am a chaith sé ag obair le RTÉ gur duine macánta é. Níl aon dabht ná go bhfuil an post seo tuillte aige. Nuair a bhí sé i mbun agallamh trí mheán na Gaeilge le RTÉ, thaitin sé liom go ndearna sé a dhícheall cabhair a thabhairt do pholaiteoirí nach raibh an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga acu. Bhí sé sin an-tábhachtach. Beidh sé in ann an scil chéanna a úsáid mar Choimisinéir Teanga nuair a bheidh sé ag obair le comhlachtaí poiblí agus daoine áirithe nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga acu. Is cinnte, ós rud é gur éirigh le Rónán Ó Domhnaill sa phróiseas seo, gur duine den chéad scoth é. Níl aon dabht ná go mbeidh ar an gcoimisinéir nua déileáil le mórán dúshlán ina phost nua má tá sé chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh i dtaobh na Gaeilge. I measc fheidhmeanna na hoifige atá leagtha amach sa reachtaíocht, tá sé de dhualgas ar an gcoimisinéir a chinntiú go gcomhlíonann comhlachtaí poiblí forálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Tá sé tábhachtach go gcoimeádfaidh an coimisinéir súil ar na comhlachtaí agus oifigí poiblí go léir ar fud na tíre ionas go mbeidh seans ag muintir na tíre seirbhísí a úsáid trí mheán na Gaeilge. Aontaím leis an Aire Stáit go bhfuil sé tábhachtach a chinntiú go bhfuil caiteachas ar an nGaeilge dírithe ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí an teanga a fhorbairt. Ba cheart do gach Teachta iarracht a dhéanamh níos mó deiseanna a chruthú do gach duine an teanga a úsáid agus a fhorbairt. Tá sé ráite agam cheana leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McGinley, gur mór an trua é nach bhfuil roinnt mhaith daoine in ann úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge tar éis blianta a chaitheamh ar scoil ag foghlaim na teanga. Dúshlán mór atá ann don tír, don Roinn agus don Oireachtas. Cé go bhfuil an-chuid oibre déanta ag na gaelscoileanna agus na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge, tá sé soiléir gur chóir dúinn go léir ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh leis na fadhbanna móra sa chomhthéacs seo. Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún seo. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go breá le Rónán Ó Domhnaill, a thagann as ceantar Gaeltachta i gContae na Gaillimhe. Tá a chosa ar an talamh aige. Tuigeann sé fadhbanna an teanga.

Chaith mé 14 years ar scoil, ach níl Gaeilge agam ná ag go leor daoine eile ar an oileán beag seo. Tá mé ag seasamh sa toghchán i nGaillimh agus i Ros Comáin. Is maith liom peil agus iomáint na Gaillimhe. Tá Ros Comáin go deas freisin. Tá mé ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus tá feabhas ag teacht orm. I wish Rónán Ó Domhnaill every success in his new job. We must ask ourselves why, on a small island like Ireland, tens of thousands of people like me have limited Irish despite going to school for 14 years. I do not know what the problem is. Maybe the Irish language has been taken over by a self-appointed elite group. When I was appointed to the arts, sports and Gaeilge portfolio three and a half years ago, some members of this group wrote an article in a local newspaper saying they were unhappy. They do not represent the Irish speakers or the people from the Gaeltacht. Indeed, the reception I got in the Gaeltacht and from Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge was absolutely terrific. We need to do something to ensure Irish is not the preserve of the self-appointed academics. People like me should be able to speak cúpla focal without having to worry if it is good enough or bad enough. There has to be a certain level. I wish Rónán Ó Domhnaill every success in his new job.It is vital that there be some discipline within the Irish language. Once again I thank the people from Clare Island and the Gaeltacht and from all the various organisations who were very kind to me who understood there were tens of thousands like me who spent 14 years at school. Maybe we did not apply ourselves as much. Something needs to be done there. I thank the Minister of State for all the work he has done in the last few years. This is an inspired appointment and I wish Mr. Ó Domhnaill well.

Ba mhaith liom freisin mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl dóibh as an bhfáilte chroíúil fhlaithiúil a chur siad roimh ainmniúchán Rónán Ó Domhnaill mar an dara Coimisinéir Teanga sa tír seo. Léiríonn an méid a bhí le rá ag na Teachtaí an meas, an urraim agus an aithne atá acu ar an bhfear seo. Ón eolas agus ón aithne atá agam féin air, táim cinnte nuair a bheidh sé ainmnithe ag Uachtarán na hÉireann mar an dara Coimisinéir Teanga, go mbeidh sé éifeachtach, díograsach agus dícheallach i gcomhlíonadh a chuid dualgas. Mar atá ráite ag na Teachtaí ar fad, is fear é a rugadh agus a tógadh sa Ghaeltacht. Is cainteoir dúchais é, tá cáilíochtaí acadúla aige agus tá taithí aige ar chúrsaí an Tí seo agus ar chúrsaí an Státchórais. Tá aithne air ní hamháin anseo, ach ar fud na tíre. Tá an t-ádh orainn go raibh duine leis na cáilíochtaí sin sásta a ainm a ligean chun tosaigh le bheith ainmnithe mar choimisinéir. Ba mhaith liom buíochas agus aitheantas a thabhairt freisin do na 20 duine eile a chur a gcuid ainmneacha isteach agus a léirigh suim sa phost seo. Bhí ard-cháilíochtaí ag gach duine acu agus d'fhéadfadh éinne acu a bheith ina choimisinéir ná ina Choimisinéir Teanga, ach tar éis na hiarratais a scrúdú agus a mheas, shíl mé féin agus mo chuid comharleoirí go raibh na cáilíochtaí cearta, cuí agus oiriúnacha ag Rónán Ó Domhnaill. Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Choimisinéir Teanga a bhí againn le deich mbliana. Rinne sé a chuid oibre go héifeachtach. Ní raibh an jab éasca, ach líon sé a chuid dualgas go héifeachtach agus is cinnte go ndearna sé seirbhís don Stát seo agus do theanga na Gaeilge. Nílim chun dul isteach i rudaí polaitíúla ag an phointe seo, ach ón taobh ar a bhfuil mé - mar adúirt an tiar-Theachta Ó Donnagáin 33 bliain ó shin sa Dáil seo - aithním go raibh suim agam i gcónaí i gcúrsaí Gaeilge. Bhí suim agam i reachtaíocht don Ghaeilge agus is minic a bhí mé mar urlabhraí ar an bhinse tosaigh don Fhreasúra ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta agus Gaeilge. Bhí mé mar chathaoirleach ar an chomhchoiste a bhí ag plé le Gaeilge i 1994, 1995 agus 1996. Bhí aithne ag daoine orm ó ghach taobh mar dhuine a raibh meas aige ar an Ghaeilge agus ar an teanga agus bhí a fhios acu go raibh mé féin as an Ghaeltacht. Ní aontaím ar chor ar bith leis an rud atá á rá ag daoine, go bhfuil an Rialtas seo i gcoinne na Gaeilge. Níl sin fíor; tá sé bréagach. Tá sé bréagach amach is amach. Níl muid i gcoinne na Gaeilge. Bhí mé ag éisteacht le cainteoirí anseo agus sheas siad suas agus labhair siad ar an ábhar seo agus dheimhnigh gach duine acu, cé acu ar labhair siad i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge, go bhfuil meas acu ar an teanga agus go bhfuil siad sásta gach tacaíocht, cuidiú agus comhairle a thabhairt don choimisinéir úr. Geallaim don Teach, nuair a bheidh sé ainmnithe ag Uachtarán na hÉireann, go ndéarfaidh mise an rud cheanann céanna.  Deirtear nach bhfuil seirbhísí á chur ar fáil i nGaeilge do mhuintir na hÉireann agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá sin fíor. Táim i mo chónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus tá aithne agam ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios agam go mbíonn orthu labhairt i mBéarla go minic nuair a bhíonn siad ag labhairt le hoifigigh. Ní haon rún é sin, ach ní Dinny McGinley a chruthaigh é sin. Fuair mise é sin le huacht; fuair mé mar oidhreacht é. Ní ormsa atá an locht maidir leis an easnamh atá sna seirbhísí Gaeilge nó i dtaobh seirbhísí nach bhfuil ansin. Ní ar an Rialtas seo atá an locht ach an oiread. Dúirt an Coimisinéir Teanga féin go bhfuil an locht ar ghach Rialtas agus ar an Stát. An rud atá an Taoiseach ag iarraidh a dhéanamh, agus é mar chathaoirleach ar an choiste Gaeilge, ná iarracht ionraic a dhéanamh na deacrachtaí seo a leigheas. Sin an rud atá á dhéanamh againn. Cibé córas a bhí i bhfeidhm le 40 bliain anuas chun státseirbhísigh a thabhairt isteach a bhfuil Gaeilge acu, níor éirigh leis. Dá mba rud é gur éirigh leis, ní bheadh muid ag argóint agus ag plé na ceiste seo inniu. Táimidne chun rud éigin a dhéanamh, rud a mhol an coimisinéir atá tar éis éirí as oifig agus a mhol lucht na Gaeilge agus a mhol na daoine a bhí ag an mhórshiúl Dé Sathairn. Táimid chun tabhairt faoi réiteach na faidhbe seo ag an phointe earcaíochta - recruitment. Sin an fáth go bhfuil cur chuige úr ar bun ag an Rialtas anois. Sin an fáth, nuair a bheidh an chéad fheachtas earcaíochta eile ar siúl - beidh sé ar siúl gan mhoill - go mbeidh gá le Gaeilge líofa a bheith ag cuóta áirithe de na hoifigigh feidhmiúcháin a bheidh á cheapadh agus go mbeidh siad ábalta a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh le saoránaigh na hÉireann i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla. Is céim ar aghaidh mhór í sin. Chomh maith le sin, tá treoir tugtha do gach Roinn scrúdú nó audit á dhéanamh - ó threoir ón Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí - ar cén áit i ngach Roinn a bhfuil feidhm le cainteoirí Gaeilge. Tá an scrúdú sin ar siúl i láthair na huaire agus tá mise iontach dóchasach go líonfaidh muid an bhearna sin. Bhí na daoine a bhí ar an mórshiúl ag caint faoi leasú ar Acht na dTeangacha 2003. Is féidir liom a dhearbhú don Dáil go bhfuil an leasú sin idir láimhe againn, go bhfuil dréacht chinn an Bhille ullmhaithe agus go mbeidh siad ag dul chuig an Rialtas le linn an téarma seo. Tá sin ráite agam arís agus arís eile, ach táim á rá arís sa Dáil anois.  Tá súil agam nuair a rachaidh an rún seo maidir leis an gcoimisinéir nua tríd an Oireachtais agus nuair a cheapfaidh an tUachtarán é, go rachaidh sé i mbun oifige díreach. Tá dúshláin roimhe agus geallaim go dtabharfaidh mise gach cúnamh gur féidir liom dó. Tig liom a dhearbhú go mbeidh cuidiú agus tacaíocht an Rialtais ar fáil chomh maith, mar go bhfuil comhchoiste na Gaeilge againn sa Rialtas. Tá an Taoiseach mar chathaoirleach ar an choiste sin agus tá na hAirí cuí air. Bím féin i láthair ag na cruinnithe. Tá cruinniú eile le bheith againn an tseachtain seo nó roimh dheireadh na seachtaine seo chugainn. Tagann muid le chéile go rialta agus beidh muid ag scrúdú na bpointí, na n-niarratas agus na gearán a bhí ag na daoine a bhí amuigh ag mairseáil an lá eile. Maidir leis an march, ní raibh aon rud agamsa ina choinne.An cheist gur mhaith liom a chur ná: Cén fáth nach raibh an march ar siúl deich mbliana ó shin nó cén fáth nach raibh an march 20 bliain ó shin? Más mall is mithid. Ba mhaith liom an rún seo a mholadh don Teach, go gcuirfidh muid ainm an duine uasal, éifeachtach, Rónán Ó Domhnaill ar aghaidh chuig Uachtarán na hÉireann len é a cheapadh mar an dara Coimisinéir Teanga.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	I move: That Dáil Éireann:Notes:— that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to provide an independent and effective civilian oversight of policing in this State;— that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda Síochána is maintained;— the reports that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission’s offices may have been subjected to covert surveillance; and— that the obfuscation by the Government, thus far, to these reports has only served to obscure the situation and undermine confidence in both State agencies, including statements made by members of the Government into the Dáil record which have now been flatly contradicted by the ombudsman;recognises that:— significant public concern now exists in relation to this matter and that there is an urgent need to ensure that public trust and confidence in the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is maintained; and— there is now a compelling case to establish an independent inquiry into this matter without delay, to be undertaken by a suitable person(s) with the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise; andcalls on the Government to establish an independent inquiry into the matter without delay and consider options including a commission of investigation, as provided for under existing legislation through the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.For the past ten days it has been clear that the institutions of the State have been severely undermined by two factors: first, the profoundly serious suspicions of bugging and intelligence gathering at the independent office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC - a statutory body established to provide independent and effective civilian oversight of policing in the State - and second, the response of the Minister, the Government and the Garda Commissioner to the mishandling of this affair over the past ten days. The situation has limped from chaos to crisis to chaos and back to crisis. It started on Sunday, 9 February, when The Sunday Times reported that a security sweep of GSOC's offices, which was conducted on the evenings of 23 to 27 September last year, found that GSOC had been targeted as part of a sophisticated surveillance operation which used "government level technology" to hack into e-mails and Wi-Fi and phone systems. On the following day, 10 February, what I can only describe as the knee-jerk reaction or instinct of the Minister was not to run to the aid of GSOC, but to summon the commission to his office for an explanation as to why it had failed to inform him - as per the law in his view - why it had taken such action. The tone and manner of this response caused grave concern and has compounded the situation rather than help resolve it. All this time the public has been watching from the sidelines. Despite everything the Government promised in the leadup to and since the general election regarding transparency and accountability, these were not forthcoming in the response to this issue on Monday, 10 February. On Tuesday, 11 February, the Taoiseach, responding to growing public concerns as articulated during Leaders' Questions in this Chamber from Opposition leaders, misrepresented the legislation. Again, he failed to grasp the gravity of the emerging crisis and went on to defend the Minister rather than acknowledge what had been reported over the previous two days. On 11 February, the Minister made a statement to the Dáil in which he provided an account based on the briefing he had received from GSOC. However, it has now emerged - a fact not disputed by anybody other than the Minister - that he was less than forthcoming with the information he had at his disposal.  On 12 February, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions invited GSOC to come before it to examine the matter. During the course of that meeting, the chairman of GSOC, Mr. Simon O'Brien, flatly contradicted what the Minister had said and put on the record in this Chamber the previous day. The written briefing the Minister received from GSOC has since come into the public domain and we now know what the Minister was told.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	386	I know that. I did not say the Minister did not publish it; I said it had come into the public domain. I will continue without interruption. What the document shows is that what the Minister said in this Chamber was not the full facts. It is no understatement to suggest that at this point the situation has become a farce and public confidence is on a downward spiral. This must be stopped. This is the reason Sinn Féin has put forward this motion calling for an independent inquiry and for all options to be considered, including a commission of investigation as provided for under the existing Commissions of Investigations Act 2004. Unfortunately, today's announcement by the Taoiseach, following a briefing to Cabinet today, falls far short of an independent inquiry. It is evident that the Government made this decision reluctantly. As Deputy Mary Lou McDonald said earlier today, it has been brought kicking and screaming to this decision to have what now appears to be nothing more than a review of documentation. The Taoiseach confirmed a number of matters during Leaders' Questions. First, he confirmed that a High Court judge would be appointed shortly to undertake a review within eight weeks. The terms of reference will be drawn up by the Minister for Justice and Equality in conjunction with and on the advice of the Attorney General, and the judge will report his findings to the Minister. Second, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will reflect, through a series of public hearings, on the efficiency and robustness of the law in regard to GSOC. Third, the Minister for Justice and Equality will appear before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions to answer questions on the issue. The Taoiseach also confirmed that a full, unredacted report would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that a debate on it would take place in the Chamber. What was announced today is not acceptable. Given the gravity of the situation that has unfolded over the past ten days, a number of questions remain unanswered. I hope some of them will be answered tonight and tomorrow, particularly in the Minister's contribution. It is evident that the Government came only reluctantly to the point at which it decided to appoint a High Court judge to review documentation. It is also evident the Minister was less than forthcoming with the information he provided to the Dáil in regard to the briefing he received.We need clarity. Why is the Minister setting the terms of reference for the review? That is like the fox designing the chicken coop. It makes no sense whatsoever, given the Minister’s performance in this regard in the past ten days. This is not personal. On many occasions at committee meetings and in this Chamber, I have congratulated and commended the Minister on some of his initiatives. On this issue, as Opposition Members, we have a responsibility to hold to account this Government and make no apologies for doing so in a robust manner. This is not personal. In essence, we are dealing with an allegation that An Garda Síochána in some way had the Garda Ombudsman’s office under covert surveillance. This is a serious situation. Why does this Government not see fit to enact the powers it has under the 2004 legislation to investigate an issue of such importance to the State? If this is not an issue of such national importance that it warrants a commission of investigation under that legislation, what is? The decision to hold a review does not restore public confidence. The question being asked and discussed around the country is who gains by not having a full, independent investigation into this matter. Who gained by the fact that all the information at the disposal of the Minister and his Department was not put on the table last week? Who will gain by having a High Court Judge review the documents and report back to the Minister, under terms of reference set by the Minister? We do not know whether the judge will have a panel of experts at his or her disposal. The Taoiseach stated today on Leaders' Questions that the judge will not have the power to compel witnesses or to take statements. The High Court Judge is being appointed to review documents and to come to a conclusion and report to the Minister. Who will gain by that? Why did the Minister not see fit to initiate a commission of inquiry under the 2004 legislation? Why has the Government decided to go for a review rather than a commission of inquiry? This is a very serious matter. Public confidence has been damaged. Questions remain. Answers must be given. Every Member of this Chamber, not just Opposition Members, has a responsibility to ensure that those who are tasked under law with the job of holding to account the policing authorities in this State can do so free from hindrance and from any targeting of their offices. It is essential that public confidence in this process be restored. We need a thorough, in-depth investigation into this, with the scope to examine all of the relevant papers and documentation as well as the power to compel witnesses to testify. This is needed so that a balanced judgment can be made with findings based on the full facts. We do not have that. That is why we will press our motion to a vote tomorrow night. We do not accept what the Government announced today. I, and many outside this Chamber, see this as the Government trying to wish away the issue, just as the Minister has been doing for the past ten days. His attitude has been cavalier, as much as to say there is nothing to say, let us move on and get on with business. This is the business tonight in this Chamber and will be the business of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions tomorrow. This is the business about which every member of our society is talking. We need a full, independent investigation, not a review of the documents. Nothing less than a full, independent investigation will suffice. 
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	The subject of this debate is hugely important to the safety of our citizens and to the quality of our democracy. We are addressing the integrity of the police service, An Garda Síochána, and the mechanisms established by this Oireachtas to ensure proper accountability of that service. I stress the word "service". Too often we hear the word "force" in respect of police here and in other jurisdictions. The Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinane, addressing the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, issue, referred to "my force". That displays a certain mind-set which has to be addressed if we are to see real reform and real accountability in policing. We need political will on the part of Government to ensure real accountability. Its conduct in this controversy, and especially, I regret, the stance of the Minister, shows a distinct lack of will in this regard. The instinct of the Government and the Minister has been to try to close down this issue as quickly as possible. It has been a closing of ranks. It is in the interests of the public, and equally of gardaí and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, that we get to the bottom of this issue. We need to know if GSOC was indeed subject to a surveillance attack, why it was targeted in this way and by whom. We need to know the background, including the relations between GSOC and Garda management and we need to scrutinise the response of Government and of Garda management. The Sinn Féin motion provides the mechanism for all of this. I believe the majority of gardaí provide a good public service, often at great risk to themselves. I have no hesitation in paying tribute to them for that. They are tasked with serving the people and, within the limits of resources, they generally do that very well. How well served are the public and the rank and file gardaí by the structure of the Garda Síochána itself and by the restrictions, set by Government, on resources? Most would answer "poorly". At the root of the current controversy is the failure of successive Governments to reform and modernise the Garda Síochána and to provide for robust accountability for the police service. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 went some way towards reform but fell far short of what was required. The establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission was a step forward, undoubtedly, which we welcomed at the time. We also, however, pointed out its shortcomings. Its powers are insufficient; the limits on it are too restrictive. The then Fine Gael justice spokesperson, the Minister's party colleague, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, urged in the Dáil in February 2005 that the Government should look to the North where the Police Ombudsman had been established and where the Police Service of Northern Ireland had replaced the Royal Ulster Constabulary.The first Police Ombudsman there was Ms Nuala O'Loan, now retired. Commenting on the GSOC controversy in the past week, she pointed to the insufficient powers of GSOC compared to the Police Ombudsman in the North. With respect to others in the Oireachtas, no one can speak with more experience and more authority than Sinn Féin on the long and painstaking task of transforming policing in the Six Counties. It has been one of the most fundamental aspects of the entire peace process. While the task is far from over, it can also be said that it has been one of the successes of the peace process. In the North, we have replaced the RUC, a highly militarised, politicised and sectarian police force, with a record of sustaining a one-party state and later taking the front line in the British Government's counter-insurgency war. In its place the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established and, while very far from perfect and with much work still to be done, it has begun the complete transformation of policing. This could only have happened in the context of a peace process and a political process based on parity of esteem and inclusivity. We in Sinn Féin have played a key role in that achievement. It is one of the ironies of history and of the peace process that we now have a situation where policing reform is more advanced in the North than it is in this State. It is useful, therefore, to compare the current situation North and South. At our request the Oireachtas Library and Information Service carried out a comparative analysis of An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and I would like to summarise that analysis. When compared, both An Garda Síochána and the PSNI are similar in organisational structure, rank-command and geographical layout. Based on census 2011 figures for both jurisdictions, there is one full-time Garda member for approximately every 349 people in the Twenty-six Counties, and one full-time member of the PSNI for approximately every 244 people in the North. The main difference is the additional layer in the Six Counties provided by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which provides a layer of democratic and broad-based community accountability. A similar structure does not exist here in the Twenty-six Counties. A democratic policing board for the Twenty-six Counties is something we in Sinn Féin have repeatedly called for. Regarding complaints procedures, both jurisdictions have police ombudsmen. While similar in structure, the Office of the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland, OPONI, has a larger staff and budget than the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. More significantly, perhaps, GSOC refers some complaints to the Garda for investigation. The OPONI, however, has its own staff to carry out all its investigations. Both bodies prevent police officers from making complaints about or against fellow officers. While the matter which has brought about this motion and this debate is of serious concern and needs to be addressed in its own right, I believe it has also opened up a healthy debate about the need for an improved police service here with robust accountability. We can and should learn lessons from the experience of peace building and police reform in the neighbouring part of our island in the Six Counties and apply them in this jurisdiction, working towards better policing on the whole island in the interest of all who view it as home.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	It has been a long while since we discovered that all was not well between the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner. As late as last summer, members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission were before an Oireachtas committee saying plainly to the Deputies and Senators present that its capacity to investigate complaints against alleged Garda misconduct had been damaged by lack of co-operation from the Garda force. They pointed to the length of time it was taking for the Garda to respond and provide information which was requested in the course of its investigations. They spoke about the protocols in place for the previous six years, which clearly they felt were not working because the ombudsman commission was negotiating with the Garda to revise them. The obstacles put in its way were never more clear than when the ombudsman commission's office was denied direct access to the PULSE system and was forced to go though gardaí to find information relevant to the inquiries it was investigating. A garda just out of Templemore, therefore, could have total access to the PULSE system but a member of the ombudsman commission could not be trusted to have that access. The Garda Commissioner actually suggested, just as this bugging story broke, that the fact that the security of the ombudsman's office might have been breached was justification to deny its members access to the Garda computer system. Since the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the attitude of the force has been strong resentment at the very suggestion that it needs oversight accountability. This attitude was reflected in the recent words of the Garda Commissioner about whistleblowers within the force. The real question here is whether the Government stands with gardaí against the ombudsman commission or does the Government stand by the proper transparency and oversight that democracy demands of the Garda by the ombudsman commission? Is the Government trying to get to the bottom of the matter in hand and to the core issue of growing public concern, that is, was the independent ombudsman commission bugged and, if so, by whom? How did they do it and, more importantly, why did they do it?  The way the Minister and the Taoiseach dismissed the discovery of bugging of the ombudsman commission's office tells us that before they even had the full information, they sided with the Garda and dismissed the threat without even examining the evidence properly - a knee-jerk reaction. It was a knee-jerk instinct typical of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and is an approach the public and this Dáil do not like. This is an issue of public trust and confidence but the Minister has served time and again to shatter that. It must be remembered that at the beginning, it was news to us all that the offices had been bugged. When the news broke in The Sunday Times, would it not have been a normal
response from Government to have had other State offices checked for bugs as well, instead of distracting from the core issue and waffling on about who should have informed the Minister about it and when? The latest available figures show us that in 2012, the ombudsman commission received 2,017 complaints from the public about Garda misconduct, while the complaints received through the Garda Commissioner amounted to only 72. The GSOC representative at the Oireachtas committee said that GSOC would closely examine a downward trend in the number of these referrals from the Garda Commissioner. They had decreased from 103, which is still a drop in the ocean of the total, in 2010 to just 72 in 2012. In a democracy, those in charge of a properly functioning police force should be working in close co-operation with those tasked to oversee it. In a properly functioning democracy, the first reaction of a Minister for justice, on realising that the police force was not co-operating with the body tasked with overseeing it and preventing or investigating its misconduct, would be to introduce support and assist with measures to fix the problem. The Minister did not do that.  The people of this State suspect that this scandal stinks to high heaven. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality have tried to confuse the issue and tried to turn the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission into the scapegoat, assisted by the Irish Independent which this morning published a story that was completely refuted by Verrimus, the British security company called in by the ombudsman commission to check its offices for bugs when it first suspected their presence at its headquarters. The bugging of the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, or the suspicion of it, is something the Minister for Justice and Equality should have taken very seriously. The proper response would be to consider the evidence, establish the source of any threat to the office, which means a threat to the democratic brief it fulfils, and to prepare a response to it in conjunction with the ombudsman commission. Instead, both the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, rowed in with the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, to blame the ombudsman commission for trying to establish if it had been bugged. How did the Taoiseach and the Minister know that this was not an unauthorised action by members of the Garda Síochána? How did the Minister and the Taoiseach know that this threat had not come from a criminal gang?There are many questions to answer, some of which have been raised by the Labour Party Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, regarding the case of drug trafficker and Garda informant Kieran Boylan. How did the Garda know - how did the Minister, Deputy Shatter, know - it was not something to do with that case? This man is not a small player in the drugs world. He was caught with €2.5 million worth of heroin. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided to drop the charges against him as his trial was drawing to a close. The ombudsman complained that the Garda had deliberately delayed and frustrated its four-year inquiry into allegations that Boylan was allowed by his Garda handlers to continue dealing drugs while he supplied information on the dealers to whom he was still selling. The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, knows in his heart that if he was in opposition and not in a Labour Party which has devoted itself to propping up this Government he would be joining Sinn Féin and other Opposition Deputies in calling for an independent inquiry into this affair. How can the decent gardaí who do their best to carry out their duties properly retain the confidence of the public while this latest debacle remains under wraps and not subject to proper public scrutiny? More than 2,000 people per year bring complaints about the Garda to the ombudsman. How are they to have confidence that GSOC can pursue their complaints in circumstances in which gardaí are not co-operating and the Minister is not fixing this problem? I urge all Deputies to support Sinn Féin's demand for an independent inquiry and to oppose the Government's amendment so that public confidence in GSOC and the Garda can be restored and the matter of possible bugging can be dealt with by those qualified to do so.

Numerous questions remain to be answered and the statements by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, have failed to address the public's concerns about this serious scandal. An independent inquiry would have the power to compel any documents relating to the illegal surveillance of GSOC to be brought before the commission. Instead of maintaining a shroud of secrecy surrounding these current events, the Minister should be looking to clarify what happened. However, the Government in its wisdom has refused this Sinn Féin motion calling for an independent inquiry. Everybody, with the exception of the Minister, the Taoiseach and the rest of the Government, accepts that GSOC's offices were bugged and that classified or sensitive information may have been compromised.

The Garda has become the centre of this scandal and the burden of responsibility lies upon that organisation to ensure it is above reproach. It must acknowledge what types of surveillance gathering it is involved in and what technology it uses. It must clarify whether it ever employs private companies to carry out surveillance operations. Could surveillance of GSOC ever be legally justified - for example, if it was believed that members of GSOC were leaking information to journalists, as they have been accused of doing? Could the Official Secrets Acts be used to justify such an operation? Only a full independent inquiry will be able to resolve such questions. It is clear that the Minister has attempted to deflect attention away from the core issues by peddling misinformation and half-truths. Why, in a properly functioning democracy, would the Minister with direct responsibility for policing be reluctant to initiate an investigation into illegal surveillance of a State body that has been established to hold the police force to account? It is also clear that the relationship between certain journalists and the Garda and, indeed, members of the Government needs to be scrutinised. Today's cack-handed attempt by Paul Williams to discredit GSOC was the most obvious example of this. The Government's line is being spun by certain elements of the media in order to deflect attention from what is really important, and one wonders what their true agenda may be. As Deputy McDonald made clear earlier today, any investigation needs to be empowered to get to the heart of the bugging scandal. It is simply unacceptable that the Minister might be allowed to set the terms of reference for this inquiry. The inquiry must investigate the Garda's handling of the well-known convicted drug trafficker Kieran Boylan, whose role as an alleged informant must be open to scrutiny because it is believed this relationship goes to the heart of the bugging scandal. The only true means of determining the facts of the matter is a thorough, transparent, independent inquiry. If the Government uses the powers available to it under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 it may well be able to get to the root of this matter. The credibility of this Government to lead into the future may depend on its ability to do so.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	Tonight's debate concerns one of the most important institutions of the State, the Garda Síochána. Recent events surrounding the alleged surveillance of GSOC have raised serious questions about its independence and its capacity to ensure proper civilian oversight of the police in this State. The seriousness of this matter cannot be overstated but, despite the fact that almost certainly the offices of GSOC have been targeted by a covert and sophisticated surveillance operation that could only have been carried out by a Government agency, the Minister and senior Garda personnel have attempted to trivialise what has happened over a ten-day period. This is unacceptable. The Minister's failure to address adequately the compromising of GSOC's security is an indictment of his attitude and approach, and earlier today the Cabinet was forced into a U-turn, announcing an inquiry with a scope so limited that it is likely it will amount to nothing more than a review into the GSOC scandal. Serious questions arise around the Minister's capacity to oversee the role of the Garda and to be truly independent in his role as Minister for Justice and Equality. His statement last week to the Dáil completely misrepresented the GSOC report and his distortion of the facts has been repeated by senior Ministers and the Taoiseach, whose initial response to The Sunday Times article which broke the story was to misinterpret the legislation in an attempt to discredit GSOC. The question arises of whether the Government wants an independent ombudsman. Thankfully, these Government failures have not undermined the public's confidence in ordinary rank and file gardaí, who provide a vital public service. However, the failures of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner were further underscored last Friday when, at their joint press conference at Templemore, the Minister attempted to row back and demonstrate his confidence in GSOC, only for the Commissioner to undo this effort by saying that the pigeon had come home to roost for GSOC. Today's decision by the Government to initiate a review into this saga is a belated response to what has become a catalogue of controversy and crises under the Minister's watch. The appointment of a retired High Court judge to inquire into all matters of relevance will be viewed with a certain cynicism, given that it will be the Minister himself, albeit on advice from the Attorney General, who will set the terms of reference and receive the report. The Minister should also be placed under forensic scrutiny as part of any examination rather than being the one to oversee the review. Yesterday, Sinn Féin publicly stated that we would be making the necessary amendments to the Garda Síochána Act 2005 in order to strengthen GSOC's powers, particularly in view of the need for GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner. Today the Government announced that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality would be asked to review the existing legislation and make recommendations for change. I suggest to the Minister that there is no opposition to strengthening the legislation and that powers to investigate the Garda Commissioner can be provided for immediately on that basis, even as broader policing reforms are considered by the committee. It is also necessary that the ombudsman, when conducting investigations, has oversight of An Garda Síochána up to and including the Garda Commissioner. We will not have a policing culture based on accountability and transparency if the person at the top of the force is exempt from independent investigation. This was eloquently noted in recent days by the former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Ms Nuala O'Loan, who said that based on GSOC's current set-up she simply would not be an ombudsman.We need to amend the legislation to give effect to these broader reforms and modernise our laws to match the policing challenges of 2014 and the administration of justice in the State. There is great merit in the idea of creating an independent policing board with proper oversight similar to the body that exists in the North. For instance, at community level joint policing committees have in most parts become talking shops. There must be community input and structures which are responsive in order to win public trust and confidence in policing. Additional powers must be devolved to joint policing committees to give local representatives direct input in the development of local policing plans. Joint policing committees also need to be given a more effective role in ensuring that local policing plans are fully implemented. The Garda must then be held to account for its implementation. Sinn Féin became a driving force for progressive change and policing accountability in the North. The Patten report provided a blueprint that enabled the creation of a policing service that is accountable and answerable to the public it serves. It is clearly time to usher in new change. The Government stood on a platform of dramatic reform. Let us now match words with action and get on with the task in hand, which the people expect and which the Government promised to deliver.

The work of the Garda Síochána, in fighting crime, combating terrorism, and protecting the public, is of critical importance. Equally, the role of GSOC, in independently investigating complaints or concerns relating to the Garda Síochána, is central to the maintenance of continued high levels of public confidence in the force. My fundamental role, as Minister for Justice and Equality, is to protect the security and integrity of the State and its institutions. My first and only concern, on learning of allegations of surveillance, was to establish whether GSOC, a critical oversight institution, had been subjected to surveillance. Prior to the establishment of GSOC, it was my view that we needed to establish such a body by way of legislation and some may recall that, following on allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal, I was one amongst other Members of this House who called for a public inquiry and on 20 November 2001 proposed an extensive motion in this House for the holding of such an inquiry. Some months later the Morris tribunal was established. When issues of difficulty arose in Abbeylara, not only was I a member of the justice committee which commenced hearings into Abbeylara, but I took so seriously the need for not only independent oversight but accountability to Parliament that I personally attended both the High Court and the Supreme Court to make submissions in favour of the justice committee being permitted to continue its inquiry into Abbeylara. Therefore, there is no one more committed than me to ensuring that we maintain the independence and functional integrity of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and that there is full public confidence in the commission. In recent days I have listened to allegations made that I am seeking to undermine the role of GSOC or that I may want to abolish it altogether. Such allegations of undermining have again been made this evening. The chairman of GSOC, Mr. Simon O'Brien, in his presentation to the Joint Committee on Public Service, Oversight and Petitions on Wednesday last stated on more than one occasion his full trust in me, as Minister. Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, a member of the commission, when questioned in an interview on "Prime Time" on Tuesday night last on my statement that evening to the Dáil, stated, "we've no disagreement at all with the Minister". Later on in the interview, when asked by Ms Miriam O'Callaghan why the commission did not report to me on the investigation undertaken by them, when it was suggested to Mr. FitzGerald that GSOC "didn't trust" me, he stated, "we have full faith in the Minister". My concern to ensure a proper working relationship between An Garda Síochána and GSOC, and the resolution of well publicised difficulties last spring between the two organisations, resulted in meetings with both the Garda Commissioner and the chairman of GSOC and, ultimately, the conclusion of a new protocol between both bodies, the objective of which was to ensure that GSOC could fully and properly carry out its statutory duties with the fullest necessary Garda co-operation. Just over two weeks ago, prior to the commencement of this controversy, I announced my intention to bring before Government proposals to amend the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to address aspects of the legislation that required change and which have been the subject of both reports and public comment. I also took the steps necessary to ensure that, in the context of GSOC's investigation into the fixed ticket charge controversy, it had direct access to the PULSE system, and stated it will also have such access in other future investigations. The statement I issued on Monday fortnight last has been available since that date on the Department of Justice and Equality website.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	Today, it was agreed at Cabinet that the input of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality would be sought on the amendments to be made to the 2005 Act with regard to GSOC, in advance of my finalising the proposals to be brought by me to Cabinet - hardly the actions of someone seeking to undermine the work of GSOC. On Tuesday last, in this House I detailed the background to the investigation GSOC initiated and the outcome of that investigation. I summarised for the House the information furnished to me by GSOC's chairman, Mr. O'Brien, at our two-hour meeting and that contained in the briefing note I received from GSOC and its public press release. I addressed the central issues of the "anomalies", "potential threats" or "vulnerabilities" identified. Two of these, relating to a Wi-Fi system and a conference call telephone, resulted in GSOC initiating an investigation on 7 October 2013. Following the instigation of that investigation, a third potential threat or vulnerability was identified in respect of a device that can access phone conversations and material from a UK telephone connected to a UK 3G network. I detailed to the House the conclusion reached by GSOC following on from that investigation and work undertaken by Verrimus, the security consultants which had undertaken the original security sweep in September 2013 and which had assisted GSOC in the investigation that took place. I recounted, specifically, from both the chairman's meeting with me and the formal brief I received, the conclusion that there was no definitive evidence of any technical or electronic surveillance of GSOC's offices. I also recounted that there was no connection between any member of An Garda Síochána with any of these matters. Despite the fact that what I said with regard to the surveillance replicated exactly the conclusion contained in the brief received by me from GSOC, I have been subject to continuing political attack alleging that I have undermined the role of GSOC and been covering up Garda misconduct. Unfortunately, both inside and outside this House, GSOC's conclusions and decision to conclude its investigation have been disregarded. In this context, it is worth noting what the commissioner, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, told "Prime Time" this day last week. Ms Miriam O'Callaghan asked the following question with reference to GSOC's press release of Monday, 10 February:In your statement last night you said there was no evidence of Garda misconduct, why would you say that in the first place if you weren't thinking that?Mr. Kieran FitzGerald replied:Because the reason we said that last night and that l'm happy to repeat it here now, is that it's part of the public discussion, in Dáil Éireann this evening, and all over the airwaves for the last couple of days, people are pointing fingers and may I say it is unfair of people to point fingers at An Garda Síochána on the basis of anything we have said or done.That was said by Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, a commissioner in GSOC. Listening to the contribution of Sinn Féin members tonight, one would think it was said somewhere in outer space and no one was listening. Ms O'Callaghan, in reference to finger-pointing, continued, "but your statement last night did that". Mr. FitzGerald replied:No, our statement last night was meant to try to clear that up and say we did not find evidence of Garda misconduct because the public discourse seems to be pointing in the direction of finding the Guards guilty of this thing when we are saying quite clearly and categorically and in no uncertain terms, we found no evidence to point to that direction and for people to suggest that, you know, they were up to something, we're the people who did the examination, we're the people with the evidence, we do not have any evidence to point in that direction.It is unfortunate that, despite that clear statement by Mr. Kieran FitzGerald on "Prime Time", we have had a week of continuous finger-pointing at An Garda Síochána, and calls for inquiries by persons who have not only assumed that GSOC was under surveillance or was bugged, but that the Garda were the culprits. We have had more of that tonight from Sinn Féin. Having regard to that party's history, of course, it suits Sinn Féin to have An Garda Síochána continuously under some form of suspicion. While I do not doubt the general legitimacy of concerns that have been expressed by various persons at reports of potential threats of surveillance of GSOC, it is a pity that we could not have had a more balanced and rational debate on these matters. An inference has been drawn by some that one of the three potential threats identified by GSOC - the use of a bogus UK network device - could only involve technology available to government agencies. The repetition of this inference has been fuelled by the Verrimus report and has caused real concern to many. Information on the technology needed to create a bogus network - usually referred to as an IMSI catcher - is in fact widely available on the Internet. It is also the case that such devices have a range of up to several kilometres, so that even if there had been such a device it could have been located anywhere in central Dublin. There is no indication whatsoever of which I am aware that it was directed at GSOC, whose staff do not in any event use UK-registered mobile phones.  I referenced this fact in my speech last week based on the briefing I received from the chairman of GSOC. It is also worth noting that in his presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the chairman clearly did not accept that the technology referred to could only be obtained by Government agencies, despite the statement to this effect in GSOC's security consultant's report. I did not reference it in my speech to the Dáil last week as the chairman had clearly placed no reliance on that advice, and this is clear from his own comments to the Joint Petitions Committee. However, we have reached the stage where these and other factual arguments cannot get a fair hearing. This political opportunism has extended to manifestly false claims that I misled this House or withheld relevant information from it. I must say again that everything I told this House in statements on Tuesday of last week was based wholly, exclusively and accurately on the oral and written briefing given to me by the chairperson of GSOC and the press statement issued by GSOC. If that were not the case, the endorsement of Mr. Kieran FitzGerald would not have been forthcoming. Some Members opposite claimed to see significance in the fact that I did not specify that the investigation launched by GSOC was under section 102 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. I made it clear to the House, however, that GSOC had launched an investigation. The fact of the matter is that section 102 is the only section under which GSOC could have launched such investigation. As anyone with even a passing familiarity with the 2005 Act will confirm, no other section could have been used by GSOC to initiate an investigation on its own initiative, so it is of no relevance that I did not expressly reference section 102 in my Dáil statement, just as GSOC did not reference it in its press release. There has been no public criticism of GSOC for not referencing and naming the section in its press release. There were other sections of the legislation relevant to the investigation undertaken by GSOC to which no reference was made and to which GSOC itself made no reference in its press release. These include section 98 and section 103 of the 2005 Act. It was not a night for delivering a legal treatise. It was an opportunity to explain to the House in as non-technical language as possible the events that had occurred as recorded to me. I assumed those speaking in the House and, in particular, the Opposition justice spokespeople were familiar with the Act. I certainly never expected that my statement would be distorted to a false allegation being made by my political opponents that I had, in some way, misled the House for some perceived political advantage. All sorts of motives have been attributed to me for not expressly mentioning section 102 of the Act, which have no credibility in the context of my knowledge that members of GSOC were the next day to come before the petitions committee and that, at an extended questioning session in the committee, there was a reasonable likelihood that specific aspects of the legislation applying to GSOC would give rise to questions. It has been suggested that I wanted to conceal the fact that GSOC commenced an investigation into members of An Garda Síochána. Those who make this charge choose to ignore the fact that GSOC's investigative remit is confined to investigating matters relating to An Garda Síochána. GSOC has no statutory entitlement to investigate any other individual or body, other than a member or members of An Garda Síochána. The issue of whether GSOC should have advised me of the investigation which it carried out under section 102 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 has also resulted in spurious claims - repeated this evening - that either myself, the Taoiseach or other Government Ministers were attempting to divert attention away from the substantive issue of whether GSOC was under surveillance. Much was made of what was seen as the discretionary nature of the provision in section 80(5) of the 2005 Act under which GSOC may - and great emphasis was put on the word "may" - make any report that it considers appropriate for drawing to the Minister's attention matters that have come to its notice and that, in its opinion, should because of their gravity or other exceptional circumstances, be the subject of a special report to the Minister. First of all, it was never a question of diverting attention away from the substantive issue of whether or not GSOC was under surveillance. There is no binary choice between one and the other. Indeed, it is precisely because the substantive issue is of such importance - a point I have repeatedly emphasised - that the question of reporting this to me was such an important matter. It was not appropriate that I first learned of it in a Sunday newspaper in a report derived from a leak from GSOC that remains under investigation. It is true that section 80(5) of the 2005 Act provides that GSOC may make a report to me in the circumstances I have described, but this is better described as an enabling provision rather than a purely discretionary one. In other words, it should be used in circumstances contemplated by the provision. In that context, I do not think that any reasonable person would regard concerns of the nature we are discussing yet again this evening as anything other than grave or exceptional. I am not sure how anyone could sensibly argue the opposite in circumstances where this issue has dominated the TV and radio news for days on end, has been the subject of countless newspaper headlines and articles, was the subject of statements in this House last week, is the subject of a motion in the House this evening, and is being examined as a matter of urgency by a joint committee of both Houses which took four hours last Wednesday to question members of GSOC. If that is not a matter of some gravity or extraordinary circumstance I do not know how one would define the meaning of either term.  Even apart from this, however, there is the separate obligation in section 103 of the 2005 Act. Section 103 provides that GSOC, where it launches a section 102 investigation, shall - and I emphasise the word "shall" - inform the Minister of the progress and results of the investigation. An exception to this strict requirement is allowed in only three circumstances, namely: where supplying the information would prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution; would jeopardise a person's safety; or, for any other reason, would not be in the public interest. The first two exceptions are irrelevant. As regards the third, I find it impossible to see how it would not be in the public interest for the Minister to be advised of an investigation in these circumstances or of the outcome of such an investigation. In any event, and to be fair to GSOC, GSOC has not argued that I was not informed for any of these reasons, and has expressed genuine regret at the decision not to keep me informed. I make these points to illustrate how some Members opposite have sought every opportunity to generate controversy and manufacture concern in the hope of scoring political points, without regard for the consequences for GSOC, the Garda Síochána or public confidence in either institution. Since I addressed this House last week on these matters, the following events have taken place: Members of GSOC participated in a four-hour hearing before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions; I received from GSOC three reports of Verrimus Limited, the first relating to the original security sweep, and the second and third relating to further work undertaken by it subsequent to the commencement of GSOC's investigation of 7 October 2013; I received from GSOC a report pursuant to section 103 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005; I have engaged in correspondence with GSOC seeking to further clarify matters of relevance; I have received a peer review report on the technical matters of relevance from RITS, an IT security consultancy firm, based in this country, to seek clarification of the technical information contained in the Verrimus report and an opinion with regard to the risks as identified and presented to GSOC; and my officials have also obtained clarification from GSOC in respect of some matters. I have considered in detail all of the documents and the information furnished to me. I have also carefully read through the transcript of the four hour hearing before the petitions committee. I have received from GSOC information additional to that furnished to me on Tuesday last, prior to my statement to the House, and some information additional to that given to the joint committee during the course of the four hour hearing. Included within that information are further details concerning the unused Wi-Fi in GSOC's offices that was remotely accessed. It seems that Verrimus identified, in September 2013, that it was being remotely accessed but could not identify from where. The unexplained accessing of the Wi-Fi is, of course, an indicator of a potential threat or vulnerability. However, as it was confirmed to me that the Wi-Fi at no stage accessed any information whatsoever contained in GSOC's office, there was of course no real breach of GSOC's security. Whilst it seems Verrimus was unable to explain why the Wi-Fi was so accessed, the section 103 report explains that the Wi-Fi showed a connection to the Bittbuzz network and that the Wi-Fi system was found to be connecting to another Wi-Fi system "located in a business premises close to the Ombudsman Commission's offices".It also states "the Bitbuzz equipment had been installed in that business premises in approximately August 2013" and that the device using Wi-Fi in that business premises had only connected to Bitbuzz in approximately August 2013. Some check was undertaken through Bitbuzz which confirmed that no confidential information had been accessed and the section 103 report records that no further inquiries were made. It was concluded that it was likely that the Wi-Fi within GSOC was randomly linking into Bitbuzz "due to some unknown technical anomaly rather than some unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance". That information only came to my attention on Friday. In reply to an inquiry from one of my officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, GSOC advised this morning that the business premises referenced was an Insomnia coffee shop within a Spar outlet on the ground floor of the building occupied by GSOC. It advertises Wi-Fi availability for customers and connectivity to Bitbuzz. I am unaware of any credible information that surveillance is being, or has been, conducted on the offices of GSOC by any of the customers of Insomnia. It is a matter of concern to me that this full information was not supplied to me prior to the Dáil debate on Tuesday last, nor given to the Oireachtas joint committee on Wednesday. Before this comment is used to accuse me again of trying to undermine GSOC, I reiterate that it is my only objective to ensure the truth is known about all of these matters. The report mentioned earlier that I received from Rits gives as an opinion, based on the reports provided for Rits, that "there is no evidence of any technical or electronic surveillance against GSOC"; that is, no evidence at all, not merely no definitive evidence. The report also disputes other conclusions reached by Verrimus. I appreciate that GSOC relied on the reports it had received from the security company it had contracted. I cannot ignore the report I received from the company asked to conduct a peer review of the technical documentation furnished by GSOC to me and the information accompanying it. Having regard to the differences that have arisen, the additional information I have received since I made my first statement to the Dáil, the ongoing nature of this controversy, its debilitating impact on the capacity of GSOC to get on with its work and the continuing overhang of suspicion voiced by some, despite the conclusions of GSOC, that the Garda Síochána or a member of the Garda Síochána was engaged in misconduct, I concluded that it was important to do what was possible and reasonable to bring an end to ongoing controversy. I briefed the Cabinet this morning on developments that had occurred in respect of this matter following on from the hearing last week of the Joint Committee on Public Service, Oversight and Petitions. I gave the Cabinet my assessment of the potential damage to both GSOC and the Garda Síochána and more widely to public confidence in the enforcement of law from the character of the current debate on surveillance concerns. It was clear to me that it was necessary to provide a structure for all issues of controversy to be addressed with calm and reason. I briefed the Cabinet on all the information at my disposal. In the light of the briefing and my concerns, my Cabinet colleagues and I agreed to the appointment of a retired High Court judge to inquire into all matters of relevance to the controversy that had arisen. Up to Friday, it was my view that GSOC had inquired into these matters and reached a conclusion and that calls for an inquiry could be seen as undermining public credibility of GSOC and a rejection of the conclusions it had reached in the investigation it had undertaken. No such inquiry calls have in the past been made when, following an investigation, GSOC concluded that there had been instances of Garda misconduct. It seemed highly inappropriate to hold an inquiry in circumstances where GSOC had concluded that there was no evidence of Garda misconduct. However, the manner in which this controversy has continued, the new information I have received and the need to bring absolute clarity, insofar as that is possible, to all of these matters lead me to the view that it is in the public interest that a retired High Court judge undertake the task agreed by the Cabinet. It is of the utmost importance that the full truth is established beyond dispute. I hope all sides of the House will welcome this and now give the judge to be appointed the time and space necessary to conduct this inquiry and report on his or her conclusions. I am reliant on the advices of the Attorney General on the terms of the inquiry and expect that they will shortly be finalised. It is regrettable that Members of this House, following the announcements, should impugn my motives and objectivity with regard to the terms to be furnished to the judge. This matter will be settled by the Attorney General and the judge to be appointed must be satisfied the terms of reference are appropriate to the matter to be looked into. I hope the decision will enable GSOC to proceed with its work unhindered by controversy. As stated, I will, of course, attend before the petitions committee tomorrow to address any issue of relevance. The report to be produced by the judge will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, unedited and untouched in any shape by me. It is regrettable that people should question my integrity and suggest anything other than that in the context of comments made in this House. It is of the utmost importance that the matter be dealt with in a calm and cool way. It is important that Members do not further impugn the integrity of either body or jump to conclusions and make public comment in jumping to conclusions in this issue and presenting themselves as defending GSOC, while denying the credibility of the conclusions reached by GSOC in its investigation. I cannot understand that approach. I cannot understand how that does what some say they are seeking to do, to ensure the integrity of GSOC. My commitment as Minister is to ensure we get to the truth. I do not express any favouritism as between the Garda Síochána and GSOC. They are hugely important bodies that will fill an important role in the State and must do so in the context of the statutory framework within which they operate. It is important that they abide by the statutory framework and meet the obligations imposed on them. It is important that no further comment be made leaving any cloud of suspicion hanging over any body in circumstances in which there is no evidence for such a cloud. That is not in the public interest. I plead with Deputies that we have had a week of hyperbole, hysteria and wild claims.

I am doing nothing about bugging journalists. I do not bug journalists, but the level of hysteria we have got to is extraordinary. The lack of understanding of the extent to which there is judicial oversight in a number of these areas is extraordinary. I plead with those contributing further to the debate that we have a discussion based on facts, not fiction, based on reality, not hyperbole. It is fair game for the Opposition to try to put a Government Minister, whether me or others, under pressure. On occasion, it is fair game to question people's capacity or the credibility of what they say. It is not fair, however, in playing that game that aspersions are cast on the Garda Síochána in circumstances where there is no evidence for such aspersions to be cast based on the conclusions of GSOC. It is unfair to suggest I have any interest of any description in trying to undermine the work of GSOC. I want to ensure that if things went wrong in this context, including the concern about the leak of information from GSOC, that they are dealt with and addressed. If there are lessons to be learned by either body, GSOC or the Garda Síochána, they should be learned. At the end we have a judge with absolute credibility and independence - a retired member of the High Court - who will independently express views on these matters. A report will be published in which we can all have faith and rely upon in the context of some of the matters which have been the source of controversy. Following the publication of the report, any action required will be taken and both GSOC and An Garda Síochána can get on with the very important work they must do.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	398	I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:To delete all words from "the investigation" down to and including "reasonably practicable", and substitute the following:agrees that the terms of reference of the inquiry into the recent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission controversy should be agreed by Dáil Éireann, that the judge appointed should be allowed to extend the terms if he deems it appropriate and the report should be immediately placed before Dáil Éireann when it is completed".This is an opportune point in time to recap some of the events that have happened over the past days. This is day nine of the controversy and everybody was hoping this week would ultimately see some form of light at the end of the tunnel so we could move on. Behind everything going on there is a fundamental concern for all of us as the two major pillars of the justice system, An Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, have been under a sustained spotlight by all of us for the wrong reasons. We all want a strong Garda Síochána and ombudsman, and we want to work with them as best we can. Part of the ongoing narrative for the past nine days was the creation of sides. We have had to decide our sides, and whether we are on the side of GSOC, the Garda Síochána or the Minister, but we are all on the same side. Members of An Garda Síochána have been in touch with me, as I am sure they have with Deputies around the House, airing their concern about what broke in the newspapers last Sunday week. I am sure the staff of GSOC are concerned as well, so we should pull together to sort out the issue. Unfortunately, nine days on the controversy is still raging. Today's announcement, which must be fleshed out, is a little underwhelming to say the least. I will get to that in a moment. The tone of the narrative from the past couple of days was set by the Taoiseach, who stated on the airwaves that GSOC had to level with the Minister. That was most disappointing. We then had the public expression of regret by GSOC, having paid a visit to the Minister's office, and that served to undermine GSOC's independence. I asked Mr. Simon O'Brien about that at last Wednesday's committee meeting and the public perception was that the body's independence was undermined. That is also on the record. The Garda Commissioner sought public clarification arising from a GSOC statement early in the controversy before the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors sought the resignation of the ombudsman. It was all very unseemly and neither the public nor any of us liked it. Much of the narrative, particularly that coming from the Government, was unhelpful, as I stated. I compliment the three-member Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. They came before the committee and were very impressive in their forthrightness. They have a very difficult job and must be supported at every opportunity by legislators. That is true for every independent office established by way of statute in the State. I hope we will not see a repeat from any Government of what has happened over the past number of days, which has seen an attack on this body's independence, with the Taoiseach publicly carpeting GSOC. GSOC made a number of valuable interventions in the week's debate, and there have been three or four appearances on "Prime Time". Mr. Kieran FitzGerald came in as an honest broker and the Minister quoted him in his contribution. The Minister spoke last Thursday evening on "Prime Time" and should have expressed confidence in Mr. O'Brien. The Minister indicated the following day in Templemore that he would express confidence in the three members of the commission as a whole but when the public watches such issues, first impressions stick. It is regrettable for the Minister for Justice and Equality not to express confidence in the chairman of the commission. We must remind ourselves that this comes against the backdrop of GSOC having had to take to the airwaves over the past number of months seeking an increase in the powers available to it under the Garda Síochána Act 2005. It was amazing to listen to Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. O'Brien taking to radio and television calling for necessary increases in powers and those pleas falling on deaf ears in the Department. Why should they have to take to the airwaves to articulate concerns about legislation and allowing them to do an effective job? If they had asked through official channels, a positive response was not forthcoming. That is the only conclusion anybody can draw. Today we published a Bill which would do exactly what GSOC has sought over the past number of months. It would provide scrutiny and oversight of the Garda Commissioner as chief of police. He is already accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the financial side of the operation. The legislation would allow serving members of An Garda Síochána to refer matters directly to GSOC, an act that is currently prohibited. It would also give the commission access to the PULSE system, which it does not have. It is ironic that the commission has full powers of inquiry under the legislation but it has limited access to PULSE.

We are trying to play a constructive role and the Minister should enact that legislation as soon as possible. Perhaps there are further or more far-reaching reforms in the Minister's mind but these are four basic requirements. Mr. Conor Brady, a former commissioner, has articulated those points for a long time and I am sure the Minister heard the comments of Baroness Nuala O'Loan at the weekend. This is against the backdrop of the disastrous handling of the penalty points fiasco by the Minister. Let us call a spade a spade. The Minister finally referred the penalty points issue to GSOC and the matter was referred to on Question Time when we had our last session. He did not tell us what had changed in his mind when he referred it to GSOC when it could have been referred in the first instance. The Minister needs to put on record why he did not act sooner. It will be very interesting to see the Garda Síochána Inspectorate report on the penalty points issue, as it has compiled a fairly comprehensive report that will be quite revealing when it sees the light of day. There is also the issue of the confidential recipient, and the Minister will have to man up to this matter. The politics side of the issue is becoming irrelevant. The way the man spoke to the whistleblower and what was said about what the Minister would try to do to him - a section of the transcript from the whistleblower - is now on the record. It is very disturbing.The whistleblower used all the relevant channels. As in the GSOC case, rather than being regarded as the victim he was turned into the villain. That is very concerning. It is regrettable that the Minister has not shown sufficient concern in any of his public utterances over the penalty points whistleblower controversy. He has not given any indication that he was genuinely and humanely concerned about the treatment to which the man was subjected when he tried to use the official channels. The Taoiseach stated in the House that the man did not co-operate with officialdom and the relevant channels. That is a very serious statement from the Taoiseach because it is completely misinformed. The whistleblower attempted to communicate with the Department of the Taoiseach on many occasions. This puts the Taoiseach's statement into an even more alarming context. The people rejected the Minister's referendum on Oireachtas inquiries. The Minister has not given us much detail on what he announced today. What is mooted is nearly a form of ministerial inquiry rather than an independent inquiry. All the Minister told us is that he is appointing a High Court judge to inquire. His statement read that it was agreed by the Cabinet today to appoint a High Court judge to inquire into all relevant matters. I was asked today whether I welcome this. I will welcome it when this controversy is dealt with satisfactorily and conclusively. However, we do not seem to be getting that. The Minister's proposal is a step in the right direction but we want to see the details. He has not given us any. When the Minister spoke earlier, he did not address the content of the Sinn Féin motion and our call on Monday of last week to establish, under the very effective 2004 legislation, a commission of investigation. This has been shown to be a very successful mechanism for conducting an inquiry in the State. There are many examples of it. He did not say in his contribution why he would not use this vehicle. The Minister said there were false claims and allegations that he misled the House. He spoke last Tuesday evening during statements and claimed there was no evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance found. He said it was unfortunate that the Garda found itself to be subject to what appeared to be completely baseless innuendo and he also stated no information had been furnished to him. Why did he not tell us what was in the briefing that GSOC gave him? It was important. A three-page brief that was made available at the committee and which is now in the public domain showed that the Minister was absolutely informed that GSOC had opened a public interest investigation. This is significantly relevant to the debate. The Minister chose not to reveal the information. This is very serious. He may dismiss it and refer to false allegations but it is not a case of false allegations as we did not write the Minister's statement. We did not deliver his statement here last Tuesday, nor did we prepare the GSOC briefing note. The Minister chose to cut and parse it and to insert his own interpretation, in keeping with the narrative that obtained all week, that is, that there is nothing to see and that we should move along. Unfortunately, this caught up with the Minister. We called last Monday for a inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, headed by a High Court judge and assisted by a person with expertise in technology and surveillance, and possibly a policing expert from outside the State. What are we getting? All we know at present is that a judge is to inquire. Will there be compellability? Who will set the terms of reference? Will it be the Minister? Will the report come back to the Dáil or Minister? Will the Minister appear before the House? All these questions are outstanding. It appears tonight that the Minister is trying to manage the process the whole way along. If he is setting up a truly independent inquiry, it must be independent of him. This is why the 2004 legislation exists. If there is a judge who is not sufficiently resourced, is constrained by the terms of reference and must report to the Minister and not the Oireachtas, many questions will remain in people's minds. Many doubts will remain in their minds also because they will have seen how the Minister acted in the past and how he acted regarding the narrative in the past eight to ten days. The people are concerned. There is a problem to be addressed regarding the outstanding question on the bugging and surveillance. The Minister may refer to Wi-Fi and all the rest but the incident at 1 a.m. is the one that is sticking with people. We witnessed the Minister's attempts to create a diversion, as if to move away from the substance of the matter and engage in camouflage and deflection from what is happening. There was an effort in the past two days to discredit Verrimus, which is very concerning also. We do not want a cover-up but an independent investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.

I support this motion because I have always believed in good quality public service and the urgent need to have an independent statutory body to provide independent and effective civilian oversight of policing in the State. The bottom line is that in any democratic state, nobody is above the law. All citizens must be treated fairly and equitably. Sadly, we have seen too many cases of people who believe they are above the law. There is an inner circle in this society. The insiders have to be dealt with and rooted out. There is significant public concern over this matter. There is an urgent need to ensure the maintenance of public trust and confidence in the Garda and GSOC. There is a compelling case to establish an independent inquiry into this matter without delay and for it to be undertaken by a suitable person with appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise. I call on the Government to establish the inquiry into the matter without delay and to consider the various options, including a commission of investigation, as provided for under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. After a week of ducking, diving and misleading statements, the Government is now being forced to act. I welcome this. A judge is to be appointed to lead an independent investigation, under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, into the ongoing allegations regarding covert surveillance of GSOC. I hope the inquiry will also use the services of a professional technologist. These are all important issues and it is important that I make these points. The days of ducking and diving are gone. The people want the truth and, above all, a justice system that is fair, accountable and equitable.

The Minister made much in his statement tonight of the fact that people deliberately tried to twist what he said and the law. He and the Taoiseach have tried to muddy the waters regarding the whole controversy and scandal that has been raging for the past nine days. The Taoiseach stated in the public domain on Monday, and again on Tuesday, that GSOC had an obligation under the Garda Síochána Act to report to the Minister and that it did not do so. That was clearly not true.The Minister said last Tuesday that he had taken the opportunity to underscore the importance of prompt reporting to him of issues of concern, as provided for under the legislation governing GSOC. The legislation does not provide that GSOC is required to report to the Minister. The Minister has said tonight that he assumed that Members were familiar with the Act, but one must wonder if he is familiar with it because he is certainly clouding the issue with the statements he is making. The statements made by him and the Taoiseach have allowed the controversy to drag on. Last Thursday night, during his interview on "Prime Time", the Minister said there was an express obligation under the Act for GSOC to report to him and he quoted section 103 of the Act. That section does not provide for any express obligation on GSOC to report to the Minister. In fact, it states GSOC can choose not to report "for any other reason not to be in the public interest". That is expressly what Mr. Simon O'Brien said to the Oireachtas committee last week, that GSOC had the view that it would not be in the public interest to put it in the public domain by reporting its concerns to the Minister in respect of the surveillance incident that had taken place. The Minister also referred tonight to the bogus 3G matter and attempted to play it down. He said he had read the transcripts of the Oireachtas committee's proceedings last week. If he had, he would have seen that Mr. Simon O'Brien stated there were British operatives with British mobile phones in the GSOC building at the time it was detected. When asked who they were, he said they were the investigators for the English security firm it had brought over to investigate the problem. When asked if it was possible that this false 3G device could have been activated to eavesdrop on their telephones, he confirmed that it was entirely plausible and possible. The amendment tabled by the Minister states a retired High Court judge will investigate all matters of relevance to the initiation and outcome of the investigation commenced by GSOC on 7 October 2013. Conveniently, that leaves the Minister, his reaction and handling of this fiasco out of the picture. This must be included in the investigation also, as it goes to the heart of the clarity required.
