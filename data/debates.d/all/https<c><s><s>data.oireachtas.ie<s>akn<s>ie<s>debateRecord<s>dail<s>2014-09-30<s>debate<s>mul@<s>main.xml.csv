This is first opportunity I have had to extend my best wishes to him. This time last year we were involved in a dishonest lead-up to the budget in the context of funding for the Department and the HSE to provide services in 2014. On 9 September the Minister said the HSE's budget would overrun by a huge amount. Will he at least set out what he intends to do regarding the budget deficit and overrun and, more importantly, how he intends to address in an honest and meaningful way the putting in place of a realistic budget for the HSE in 2015?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for his words of congratulations. Vote 39 for the Health Service Executive, HSE, is showing a net current deficit of €260 million against profile at the end of September. However, receipts from the United Kingdom which were profiled for November were received in September and when they are excluded, a net current deficit of €432 million emerges. In income and expenditure terms, the HSE is reporting a year to date net expenditure figure of €7.039 billion to the end of July against a budget of €6.754 billion, leading to a variance of €285 million. The acute hospital sector accounts for €160 million or 57% of the overall deficit. Employment agency costs were €194 million, up €63 million on the figure for last year, a significant element of which was incurred in acute hospital services. The primary care division had an overall deficit of €54 million, with local demand-led schemes a key area experiencing excess expenditure. Undoubtedly, 2014 is proving to be a financially challenging year for the health service. While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that demanding financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the past number of years as a direct consequence of the crisis in the public finances. The cumulative impact of this unprecedented period of financial and resource restraint has resulted in reductions in the health service budget of €1.5 billion since 2008, with numbers employed reduced by 14,000 over this period.  These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards. Despite these resource reductions, the HSE has managed to support increasing demand for its services arising from such factors as population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, an ageing population, increased demand for prescription drugs and new costly medical technologies and treatments.  Currently, it is anticipated that a Supplementary Estimate in excess of €500 million will be required to support services in 2014. This is based on costs to the end of July and takes account of the HSE’s best estimate of likely expenditure to year end, mitigated by ongoing cost containment plans and income generation. It is important to stress that, as with any forecast, there is some degree of uncertainty, particularly given the scale of the overall HSE cost base, the complexity of the services and the lack of a national financial system. This forecast deficit excludes any overrun on the State Claims Agency, which relates to medical negligence payouts.  The HSE continues to work closely with my Department to mitigate the projected deficit to the greatest degree possible.

Waiting lists have increased; for example, only recently in University Hospital Limerick 47 patients were waiting on trolleys. The notion that the HSE has managed to maintain services is simply not credible by any stretch of the imagination when one considers the difficulties health services face every day in front-line provision.That is evident in emergency departments and outpatient waiting lists.  The key problem stems from last year when the previous Minister for Health, without support and possibly lacking all credibility at the Cabinet table, was unable to deliver a meaningful budget to fund the HSE service plan for 2014. No one inside or outside the House believed last year's budget was sustainable and it was in difficulty from the word "Go". Hopeful phrases such as "unspecified savings" and "probity" were included in a service plan that was meant to deliver services for those who needed them the most. Will the Minister have an honest and up-front appraisal of the funding required in 2014 and engage in a meaningful discussion aimed at ensuring the Department secures a sustainable budget that will provide the services required?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	One should not make the mistake of believing serious problems in one area reflect the position throughout the health service. I look at the figures for the numbers of patients on trolleys every day and while there is an overcrowding problem in Limerick, the figures on a given day may show that half of perhaps 50 or 60 patients on trolleys are in three hospitals and another ten hospitals may not have anyone waiting on a trolley. The same applies to outpatient waiting lists, with three of 49 hospitals accounting for more than half of the waiting list. Let us, therefore, not make the mistake of believing a small number of services or areas are representative of the whole system. As I am in discussions on the budget, I am precluded from discussing that matter. However, it is worth making a few points that are not often made in the debate. The health budget has declined from €16 billion in 2008 to an outturn of approximately €13.7 billion this year. Once the figure has been adjusted to take account of the funding transferred for children's services, the budget outturn increases to close to €14.1 billion. This indicates that the health budget has been cut by approximately €2 billion in cash terms since 2008. No other Department has made such a large cash contribution to reducing the budget deficit and in some Departments expenditure has increased since 2008.  According to figures bandied about in the press, I am seeking either €1.2 billion or €900 million in additional funding for next year. I can state categorically that is not the case. I am seeking to achieve a neutral health budget to enable the Department to spend more or less that what was spent this year. I will try to provide a better service next year within the existing budget.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	While we all understand the public finances are under pressure, choices must be made every year as to where funding is to be targeted. The Government has proposed for some time that children aged under six years receive free general practitioner care. Last year, under the guise of probity, decisions were taken which resulted in medical cards being removed from the most vulnerable. I am a realist, but one must target scarce resources at areas where they are most needed. The previous Minister for Health had a vision and outlined grand plans for universal health insurance and free general practitioner care for everyone. At the same time, however, the Department cut funding for services for the most vulnerable. The key task is to identify how to provide sustainable services in a fair, equitable and compassionate manner. The Minister should forget the idea of pursuing his predecessor's proposals on universal health insurance and free GP care for everybody when we cannot afford to provide basic services for the most vulnerable. His starting point must be to have an honest appraisal of what can be funded and how to do so in a fair and sustainable manner. The idea of making grand promises and subsequently trying to find budgets to fit into them by taking money from the most vulnerable is, to say the least, distasteful. 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	Two weeks from now, Ministers will know what their budgets will be. At that point, they will be able to determine how their allocations should be spent and will obviously have to identify priorities. The nature of health and all areas of public expenditure is that everyone believes his or her priorities should be the main ones, but the nature of politics is that decisions must be taken on what the priorities should be. I emphasise that health expenditure has been reduced from €16 billion in 2008 to €14 billion this year and that, in cash terms, the Department makes the largest contribution of all Departments towards balancing the books.My objective in next year's budget is not to look for loads of extra money. I am realistic about that. I am seeking to hold health spending next year at what it is this year.

I am seeking to establish what steps have been taken by the Department of Health, the HSE and other Departments, including the Minister's former Department, to ensure that our population is not subjected to the risk of contracting Ebola, a merciless scourge that has already taken more than 3,000 lives along the west coast of Africa, as well as the lives of others exposed to this highly contagious disease.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	On 8 August 2014, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola outbreak in west Africa to be a public health emergency of international concern. As of 24 September 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to Ebola in the five affected west African countries stood at 6,263, including 2,917 deaths. There have been no cases of Ebola in Ireland. The focus of public health planning is on dealing with any cases of viral haemorrhagic fever that may be imported from another country. The HSE's Ebola scientific advisory group and emerging viral threats group have been meeting regularly to review the situation and approve national guidance for Ebola and other emerging viral threats to health, and to ensure implementation of this guidance.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which is part of the HSE, has issued this guidance to hospitals and GPs, including an algorithm for the assessment of viral haemorrhagic fevers and clinical assessment forms. Health professionals have been advised that any individual presenting with particular symptoms must be urgently assessed using the viral haemorrhagic fever algorithm and clinical assessment forms, which are also available on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre website. There are also protocols in place for viral haemorrhagic fever risk assessment by ambulance personnel at airports and shipping ports. Paramedics will transport suspected victims either to the national isolation unit at the Mater hospital or to the nearest emergency department, depending on the risk assessment for each individual case. Posters giving information about Ebola are on display in ports and airports. It is national policy that any case of Ebola should be treated at the national isolation unit, if the patient is medically fit for transfer. The guidance includes protocols for the safe ambulance transfer of such a patient. The National Ambulance Service has arrangements in place for a Garda escort for the ambulance transporting the patient to the national isolation unit. In Ireland, all diagnostic testing for Ebola is carried out in the National Virus Reference Laboratory. Testing is carried out only with prior consultation with the laboratory, which provides advice on the packaging and transfer of specimens. As a precautionary measure, tests have been carried out on 18 samples from 12 patients with reported symptoms and a travel history consistent with the case definition for Ebola. The results of all tests have been negative for the Ebola virus. There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Updated travel advice is available on the latter Department's website. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises Irish citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Considerable public health planning is under way with a range of bodies and professionals in relation to the implications of the Ebola emergency in west Africa. The matter was discussed in Milan last week at the informal Council of Ministers meeting at which I was present.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Minister for his reply. The European Commission has donated some €180 million to help fight the epidemic. The death toll has now exceeded the 3,000 mark and that is just six months after the outbreak first occurred. It would appear from the statistics that there is an increasing incidence of deaths due to Ebola. Over the past fortnight the number of deaths has been much greater than in any previous fortnightly period since the outbreak began. On this morning's RTE radio programme, "Today with Sean O'Rourke," it was suggested that by January 2015 the figures could have risen to exceptional levels, even to 1.2 million. These are alarming indicators of a situation that is not under control, although I am not suggesting that it is out of control. I ask the Minister to consider what further steps can be taken. The Minister said no case of Ebola had been identified in Ireland, thank God.However, what direction are we giving the population? This is a highly contagious disease, yet people are being encouraged to seek medical attention. This could be putting others at risk, not only general practitioners but also others in hospital sites. We must have a very clear indication as to what steps people should take if Ebola is suspected, because the disease can take hold very quickly, by which time there is a crisis. Is the Minister in a position to tell me whether we have in this jurisdiction a stock of the drug ZMapp, which appears to have been effective in the treatment of two American aid workers who contracted Ebola? What further steps does the Minister believe the Government can take on travel? We heard this morning that a suspected case of Ebola was identified on a flight out of Africa. This is absolutely frightening for people. It is very important that representatives of the people, on both the Government and Opposition sides, ensure we have the very highest levels of protection in place for our population and face up to our international responsibilities by contributing the best we can offer to help curtail and, I hope, eradicate the disease, which presents such a terrible challenge.

The outbreak in West Africa is very serious. Our main efforts are obviously to support the work taking place there through the Department of Foreign Affairs, the World Health Organization, the European Commission and various aid agencies on the ground. We must issue travel advice and have measures in place to identify a case quickly should it occur in Ireland, and ensure that any person affected is isolated at the isolation unit in the Mater, provided he or she is fit to be transferred there. Therefore, we have plans and contingency arrangements in place. General practitioners and other doctors have been advised of the diagnostic algorithm and what to do should a case be suspected in their offices or surgeries. I do not know whether we have a stock of the particular drug the Deputy mentioned, but I will certainly check that out.

It is used for a variety of infectious diseases. Has there been any upgrading or preparation for Ebola? It would be an obvious location for the drug I mentioned, ZMapp, if there is to be any supply in this jurisdiction. On Ebola itself, what steps have been taken to ensure there is adequate training and preparation for an outbreak, even a single case, in our population? Are steps being taken across the first line of engagement for people presenting, be it through hospitals, doctors' practices or nurses? What steps have been taken to prepare and train personnel to respond properly to circumstances that are unprecedented in our living experience, and can the Minister advise us on what help and assistance we are offering, in terms of personnel or financial support, in the effort to address the problem at its point of origin in west Africa?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	There are many questions there and I do not believe I will be able to answer them all in the minute allowed, unfortunately. With regard to the national isolation unit in the Mater hospital, there is a self-contained unit with 12 beds. These include six lobbied en suite single rooms with negative pressure ventilation so the virus cannot spread through the air. Two of the isolation rooms are of high specification and are separate from the rest of the unit. They have a different air-handling system. The Deputy also asked about our support for efforts in west Africa. To date, Ireland has provided direct funding of €350,000 to organisations working on the Ebola response in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are partner countries for Ireland. The funding is in addition to that associated with Irish Aid's ongoing programmes in both countries. It provided €3.9 million in bilateral aid to Sierra Leone and over €2 million for health and nutrition programmes.I can provide the Deputy with the remainder of the information.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	What is the Minister going to do about the comments at the UN Human Rights Committee which roundly condemned Ireland as contributing to the mental suffering of women by failing to address the abortion reality? These warnings tragically have been vindicated quickly in the horrific Miss X case which shows that the legislation the Government introduced last year does not give a woman whose life is in danger access to an abortion to which she is legally entitled. Is it time to repeal that legislation and the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, as suggested by the United Nations?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	As the Deputy is aware, Article 40.3.3o of the Irish Constitution states:The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.The interpretation of Article 40.3.3o was considered by the Supreme Court in Attorney General v. X in 1992. Furthermore, in December 2009 the European Court of Human Rights heard a case brought by three women in respect of the alleged breach of their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights in regard to abortion in Ireland. This action was known as the A, B, and C v. Ireland case. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 was enacted in July 2013 and commenced in January 2014. The purpose of the Act is to restate the general prohibition on abortion in Ireland, while regulating access to a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with the X case and the judgment in the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B, and C v. Ireland case. The Act received careful consideration by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, including three days of public hearings. The guidance document on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 has now been published. The guidelines are designed to assist professionals in the practical operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. The guidance document includes advice on identifying referral pathways to fulfil the requirement of the Act to ensure women whose life might be at risk can receive appropriate medical care. I do not intend to propose any amendment to the Act or the eighth amendment of the Constitution at present. In regard to the case now known as the Ms Y case, I am awaiting the report by the Health Service Executive and hope to receive it as soon as possible. Once I have had an opportunity to review it, I will consider if any further action needs to be taken.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	We do not need any further report, although the drip-feed in the media indicates that the information we will get will be illuminating. The guidelines reiterate that the purpose of the Act introduced last year was to confirm the general prohibition on abortion, but that was not the case. It was to legislate for the lawful circumstances in which a woman was entitled to have an abortion in this country, when her life was in danger. Tragically, the Y case proved that a woman who had met the criteria was unable to access her lawful right to have an abortion here because of the inadequacies of the legislation introduced by the Government. We have doctors and the medical profession operating on the basis of a criminal prohibition, which has a chilling effect. We have excessive scrutiny by the medical profession, which adds to the mental anguish experienced. Interestingly, the UN Human Rights Committee pinpointed the circumstances of Ms Y when it referred to the discriminatory impact of the legislation on people who did not have a right to travel. When we add this and the inefficiencies of the legislation to the fact that 160,000 Irish women have had to travel for abortions in recent decades, does the Minister believe that in the interests of decency, respect and the recognition of the abortion reality, they should be able to have that treatment at home rather than being forced to travel?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	There are various accounts in the newspapers of the Y case. The reason I want to wait for the report is that there is information in the newspapers about which I know nothing. Therefore, I want to wait for the report, to see all of the facts and consider them. I do not want to jump to conclusions and I am concerned that people on both extremes of the issue, within a day or two of the case happening, had already decided that everything that had had happened confirmed their pre-existing views of the issues involved. That is not a good approach to adopt. The UN Human Rights Committee recommended that Ireland's laws on abortion be liberalised, but it did not go as far as the Deputy seems to recommend - abortion on request or demand. The Deputy is being a little selective in using the UN committee to bolster her case.It has not endorsed the Deputy's view of abortion. The purpose of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was, first, to confirm the general prohibition on abortion in the State and, second, to codify and provide in law for the legal termination of pregnancies where a life was at risk. A termination of pregnancy did occur in the case referred to by the Deputy, but it occurred by Caesarean section rather than being an abortion due to the gestation of the foetus.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I agree with the Minister that some of the media commentary has been very unhelpful. However, I do not believe his points about extremes in the debate. The reality has been, as successive opinion polls have shown, that the majority of Irish people believe a woman should have access to a termination in a wide range of circumstances where her health is in danger, where she is the victim of rape, in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities and so on. The recent opinion polls also indicate we should be repealing the eighth amendment, given that most of us were not around when that legislation was brought forward. What the UN Human Rights Committee actually stated was that we should look at legislating for those circumstances, including looking at the difficulties being caused by the constitutional scenario, which ludicrously and appallingly equated the life of a grown woman with that of a foetus. That is what it asked us to look at; that is the truth and I am sorry if the Minister does not like it. I am asking him, as a young man, if he thinks it is a little ridiculous that we enacted legislation that would only ever deal with a tiny minority of women who needed to secure an abortion where their life was in danger, when, for each of these women, there are thousands of other Irish women every year whom we say have a constitutional right to travel to England or Holland for an abortion, but they cannot access that medical treatment here at home. Does the Minister, as a doctor and a young man, think that is an abomination in the modern era?

I understand that is the Deputy's position. It is one she is-----
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I am not talking about my position.

I will give my opinion as a doctor and a young man at a later stage. However, I am Minister for Health and the Government's position is clear - we have no plans to repeal the eighth amendment. It is important to bear in mind that if the eighth amendment were to be repealed, it would result in the removal from the Constitution of any protection afforded to the life of the mother and the unborn child. The Deputy will recall, for example, that the first divorce referendum was unsuccessful and that it was successful the second time because people knew what they would be replacing it with. It was replaced with a different amendment and the legislation was published. That is not what the Deputy is proposing. It appears that what she is proposing is just the deletion of the amendment and allowing the Dáil to enact any legislation it likes. I believe people would have a difficulty in voting in a referendum in those circumstances.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	Then regulate it like other medical procedures.

The object of this question is to establish from the Minister of State what her plans are to accelerate the recruitment of professionals within that sector. One can argue that this is the consequence of the breach of the programme for Government last year when funding that was to be ring-fenced was cut in a very crass manner. It has resulted in the HSE cynically designing a situation where it would leave the impression that it was recruiting in this calendar year when it intended to recruit them in December.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I will answer the question as submitted.  Psychologists employed by the health service play an integral role in the delivery of a wide range of psychological services. These include the following: working with children and their families who present with developmental, emotional or behavioural difficulties and others who have intellectual and physical disabilities; working with adolescents with a wide range of difficulties from adjustment problems to serious mental health issues; and working with adults who present with mental health problems, including anxiety, depression and mental disorders. Psychologists deliver services in a number of ways: as part of a multidisciplinary team of health professionals, as part of a network of health professionals, or as sole health professionals providing services to individual clients. They deliver their services in a range of settings, including community-based health centres, residential centres, nursing homes and hospitals. The HSE employs professionally trained psychologists, including counselling psychologists, clinical psychologists and educational psychologists, in a range of roles across the health service. Counselling psychologists are largely employed in primary care and national counselling services. Under section 22 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE has the authority to appoint persons to be its employees and may determine their duties. This includes the appointment of persons to posts within the psychology service. With regard to the recruitment of psychologists, in the context of significant organisational change and realignment, it is the executive's intention to review the selection criteria for posts within the psychology service. The review will commence in November, and as part of this process the views of stakeholders will be invited and consideration will be given to developments within the profession. This review is timely in order to ensure that the recruitment of professionally trained psychologists continues to meet the needs of our evolving health services. I welcome the review and look forward to receiving the results of the report once it is completed.

As she is aware, up to 15,000 children are languishing on waiting lists for early intervention teams. The much-lauded concept of the early intervention team lacks the sort of supports that are required to ensure that the multidisciplinary expertise is there across the disciplines described by the Minister of State in order to give children at an early stage of life an opportunity to develop and have educational opportunities in the same way as any other child. What plan does the Minister of State have to accelerate the specific recruitment of the psychologists? I am concerned that the advice the Minister of State has received from the national association representing that profession is being ignored in her approach. It is important that we both agree that the critical thing is to address the waiting lists. We have demonstrated in this Chamber that up to 15,000 children have been waiting over two years for assessment, which is unacceptable.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I agree with the Deputy and share his concerns about this area. I am having another meeting this evening with the officials who operate the national mental health services within the HSE. I agree with the Deputy that there is a difficulty. I have been doing a bit of research lately that may not be joy to the ears of those working within the service, but it is definite that some services are working extraordinarily well while other services simply are not. We must remember at all times that this is about the child. We are recruiting as best we can. I am sure the Deputy also knows that there is a difficulty with recruitment processes. The new review will help that, but we must certainly take a serious look at whom we recruit, how we recruit them and the shortage that exists. The shortage deeply concerns me, but even more worrying is the fact that children are waiting longer than necessary for assessments.

Last year there was a commitment to provide for €35 million in ring-fenced funding for mental health services. That broken promise has resulted in the Minister of State designing a time delay which deliberately prevents the recruitment of staff that would address the waiting lists we have described. In the forthcoming budget, does the Minister of State intend to address that situation and restore the moneys that were cut in last year's provision that was ring-fenced in the programme for Government - the figure of €35 million? Is it her intention to restore that €15 million, as was the rhetoric at the time, on top of the €35 million specifically designed for the recruitment of specialist staff?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I will not take that long. My clear intention is to ensure we have a plan relating to recruitment and the upcoming budget. The Minister and I have been involved in those negotiations for the past number of weeks.Part of that planning will involve today's meeting. It is all about planning and ensuring we have timeframes. There was a timeframe last year, no matter what other opinions may be. It is my job to ensure the timetable is adhered to and that when we get the additional money this year, which I assume we will because I have no reason to believe otherwise, we will have a plan to use it. Things change and one should be flexible enough to ensure that when changes occur one is prepared for them in order to get the best possible results for the people one is charged with representing.

These hospitals are still in service, though their services have been significantly reduced over this past decade and more.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	The Government’s decision to establish hospital groups, where small and larger hospitals work together, was informed by two reports, the hospital groups report and the smaller hospitals framework.
 The hospital groups will provide an optimal configuration of services, with benefits relating to safety, quality, access and cost. Every hospital, large and small, will play a vital role in their group.  The smaller hospitals framework defines the role of the smaller hospitals and outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate in partnership as a single hospital group. It also defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within the group in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, recruitment of high quality clinical staff and safe management of deteriorating and complex patients.  The framework outlines in detail the wide range of services that can be provided in smaller hospitals, the services that can be transferred from larger to smaller hospitals and commits to the expansion of less complex services in these hospitals, such as day surgery, ambulatory care, minor injury units, medical assessment units, screening, other medical services and diagnostics. It is envisaged that smaller hospitals will provide more, rather than fewer, services, with more flexibility so that patients are the ultimate beneficiary of the reforms.  The initial focus is on getting the hospital groups up and running as single cohesive entities. In 2015, each hospital group will be asked to develop a strategic plan to describe how they will provide more efficient and effective patient services, reorganise these services to provide optimal care to the populations they serve and how they will achieve maximum integration with other groups and all other health services, particularly primary care and community care services. Alongside the work done at hospital group level, work will be done at a national level on the best configuration for certain national specialties.  Small hospitals have a bright and busy future providing a wide range of existing and new services, but it will not be possible for every hospital to be a centre of excellence or specialist centre for everything. We need to be honest with people about that. Separately, I foresee many services moving out of hospitals and into primary care in line with clinical programmes strategy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I thank the Minister for his reply. I support a policy of having more, rather than fewer, services. As in so many areas in this country we go overboard in following the lead of others in other jurisdictions in comparable matters, and that has been the experience of many people in many reconfigured arrangements currently in place. I could instance several such cases. We have heard today of the situation in Limerick regional hospital where overnight an exceptional number of patients were kept in wholly inappropriate settings. That cannot go on unchecked.  We have to recognise that there are other options. There are alternatives, in cases where certain ailments are present, to transporting such patients by ambulance to a so-called centre of excellence and bypassing existing facilities which have the capacity, trained staff and competency to deal with such situations. This has been acknowledged to me by hospital management and practitioners in critical hospital sites across the State.I appeal to the Minister as a new mind with a fresh approach, as he has demonstrated in other areas, to look seriously at the potential of smaller hospitals to relieve the distress presenting at so many of the larger sites.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	When it comes to reorganising services, we must always bear in mind that medicine, best practice and clinical science are always changing. There will never be an end point when it comes to reorganising services and we will always be adapting them. What we need in the health service is not disruptive reform but evolutionary reform, which means more things moving from hospitals to primary care, more specialist centres being centralised and more services moving from large central hospitals to smaller ones. I had the opportunity to visit Roscommon on Saturday where I spent a few hours in the hospital. I was impressed to see that there were services in the hospital which were not available in Blanchardstown, where I live, including, for example, a minor injuries unit where one can be seen in less than an hour with a laceration, broken bone or other injury of that nature. It also has a medical assessment unit to which a GP can send a patient during the day for assessment by a consultant. That is a good example of a smaller hospital providing the services those of us in Cork or Dublin would love to be able to offer our constituents. To perhaps answer the Deputy's question a little better, when I look at trolley and overcrowding numbers across the hospital system, it is evident to me that one may have a great deal of overcrowding in three or four hospitals and none in ten or 11. It is not always down to resources, but is sometimes the result of management. It is clear that more beds are required in Limerick and a plan is in place to provide a new emergency department there. Between now and then, there will be difficulties; perhaps some work might be moved back out to Ennis or Nenagh in the interim to alleviate the pressure.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I welcome the Minister identifying both of the sites he has just mentioned. I had not intended to refer specifically to any of the hospital sites for fear of leaving one out. The Minister has identified immediately what might be done in relation to University Hospital Limerick. There are many other examples. There is international evidence of increasingly poor outcomes, including increased mortality, in relation to the closure of accident and emergency departments and their over-centralisation. A recent study in California has demonstrated as much and it is reflected across a whole range of studies conducted globally. We need to recognise that is the case. It is estimated by some of the Minister's colleague practitioners in front-line hospital employment that up to 90% of some of these emergencies, particularly in the older age group, do not require a transfer to larger hospital sites with a range of specialty supports. One could be dealing with pneumonia or a range of other things that could be provided for and dealt with clearly on the smaller hospital sites to which I have referred and which are still open, working and capable of dealing with these issues. It would also be hugely welcomed by the individuals concerned because they are closer to their homes and accessible by their families, with all of the better and speedier outcomes that come as a consequence. I ask the Minister to look at all of these matters. I speak from experience; it is not something I am reading about. I live in a community that lost the greater number of its services at Monaghan hospital, a fine institution that is way under-utilised in terms of its potential. I urge strongly the Minister's review of the area.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	There will be a job to be done in educating the public and, to a lesser extent, GPs about where patients should go and when. Ideally, an older patient with pneumonia should be referred by his or her GP to a medical admissions unit, if there is one available. He or she should not - at least not during the day - be calling an ambulance to take him or her to an emergency department. The same applies to minor injuries. Where there is a minor injuries unit available, a patient should go to it rather than the emergency department. Certainly, he or she should not be calling an ambulance. There is a significant job to be done to change mindsets around this issue.In some countries ambulance crews can discharge patients from the ambulance and not take them anywhere if they do not need to go to a hospital. Similarly, ambulance crews have more autonomy in deciding where they take the patient, and there are many such systems that can change in time. Any decision to reconfigure services among the hospitals in Limerick, Nenagh and Ennis is a matter for the hospital group to decide, not me. Unfortunately, that group is running very much over budget. It is the one running most over budget among all the hospital groups, and that is a matter of concern in itself.

On 2 April the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Health published a White Paper on universal health insurance. It was light on detail and unclear as to what was intended with regard to the funding model, but on taking office the Minister rode back to a certain extent from that commitment to universal health insurance. What is the timeframe for the introduction of universal health insurance? Has it been put on the long finger or dropped?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I am committed to a major agenda of health reform in line with the commitments contained in the programme for Government and our policy statement, Future Health. I want to push ahead as soon as possible with key reforms in areas such as extending GP care without fees on a phased basis, improving the management of chronic diseases, implementing key financial reforms, including the money-follows-the-patient model, and establishing hospital groups as a critical enabler of improving patient quality and efficiency. These are big milestones on the road to universal health care. When I became Minister for Health I reviewed our progress to date and the timescales for implementing very important reforms, including universal health insurance, based on universal entitlement to a single-tier health service that is based on need and not on financial means. While I believe it will not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing these reforms. In order to do this I want to examine some key elements further and then decide on the best way forward, but this should be considered as a refocusing of our reforms, not an abandonment of them. In regard to UHI, my Department initiated a consultation process on the White Paper following its publication. An independent analysis of the submissions is under way and I expect to receive this report in the next week. I will then publish it at a later date. My Department has also initiated a major costing exercise to estimate the cost of UHI for households, employers and the Exchequer and is working closely with the ESRI and the Health Insurance Authority. Initial costings should be available in the first quarter of 2015. The independent thematic analysis of submissions from the consultation process on the White Paper and the results of the major costing exercise on UHI will assist in charting a clear course towards the objective of creating a universal, single-tier health service.

The central policy is the introduction of UHI. It is evident from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others bodies, including the Health Insurance Authority and those providing cover in the marketplace, that this will increase the cost to ordinary families. It will not be progressive. Middle-income families will have to pay extraordinary sums of money for compulsory health insurance if it goes ahead as envisaged by the previous incumbent and the proposals published in the White Paper. I am beginning to wonder if this is an election ploy, because the Minister knows he is in a cul-de-sac when it comes to the funding of the health services, and that UHI will be a major financial burden on middle-income families. He is slowly trying to let this policy wither and die. It is evident from the Minister's answer that there is no commitment to UHI. Will he not do the decent thing now and say that he is parking UHI and examining other options with regard to the provision of universal health care, which is fundamentally different from UHI?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	To be clear, we are not parking UHI; that is not what I said. I spoke about universal health care and universal health insurance. To me, universal health care includes a number of dimensions, for example, access to general practitioners without fees, which will be tax funded, and access to primary care.It also includes health insurance for everyone across the hospital system, which could be extended into primary care. A public consultation was held on the White Paper and I will have it and publish it within weeks. At the end of quarter one 2015, I will have the costings for universal health insurance and at that point, instead of speculating about it, we will know what it will cost the Exchequer, employers and individuals and then we can take the debate from there. Practical progress is happening. I am interested to know what is Fianna Fáil's policy on universal health insurance and universal health care. I have heard Deputy Kelleher speak on the radio about how we need to make the public system better and the private system better too. It seems the Fianna Fáil remains, as it always has been, committed to a two-tier health service, which marks a great contrast between Fianna Fáil and the parties on this side of the House, which are committed to a single-tier health system, even if it takes time to make it happen..
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	We stated quite clearly that we were opposed to the universal health insurance model and committed to a taxation based model. The principal reason we are committed to a taxation model is that it is progressive. Those who have most and earn most pay most and contribute most to the health services in this country. The universal health insurance model was the opposite of that, which is why the Government is slowly letting it wither and die. It knows that the model will place an extraordinary burden on ordinary families. If the Government was so committed to it, one would think it would do more research prior to the election so that we would have a rough idea how much it will cost, as opposed to the opaque plan with no clear costing or policy on how to get there. That is the problem. We have great difficulties in funding the health services but we must establish the fundamental principle of how to fund it in the first place. We still do not know the view of the Government on how it will fund the public health system today, tomorrow and into the near future other than universal health insurance at some stage. We support the concept of universality when it comes to GP access but as I said to the current Minister and the previous Minister people cannot fund universality by taking it from those who do not have. That is clearly what the Government is doing. In respect of general practitioner access, it is taking medical cards and other services from people who do not have them. The Government must get its priorities right. The vulnerable and those who need medical care the most must be the priority. Those who can afford health care can be worked into the system but not as the priority, as an election gimmick or as a way to buy votes in the coming 18 months. That seems to be the tenor of the Minister's comments. The Minister is becoming very political in looking at cohorts that may reward the Government electorally. It is the wrong thing to do.

What Deputy Kelleher is saying is incorrect. However, he let the cat out of the bag about the Fianna Fáil policy because he said his party was committed to universal health care and wanted it to be tax funded. How much will it cost and who will pay for it? What tax increases is Fianna Fáil proposing? Everyone else in the country is talking about the potential for tax reductions but Deputy Kelleher has indicated that Fianna Fáil policy-----

This is of concern to people in my part of the world in the west of Ireland. I have been contacted by people who are considering doing the course or had done the course. They have families and feel they must spend two years in the Dublin area at a considerable distance from their homes.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	The issue raised by the Deputy was the subject of intensive conciliation at the Labour Relations Commission during the summer between the nurses' representative body, the INMO, and the HSE, given that nurses who were due to graduate would have had difficulty in obtaining posts in their preferred locations. Conciliation meetings were held on 6 and 30 June and on 22 July. The conciliation conference held on 22 July resulted in significant progress between the INMO and the HSE. Related settlement proposals were drawn up by the commission and issued to the parties on 23 July. The settlement proposals recognise that the situation is problematic, given that the HSE has more public health nurse vacancies in the greater Dublin region than there are nurses in the 2013-14 class who wish to or are able to work in that region. The situation is further complicated by the fact that a national recruitment panel is in place since 2011 which is composed of public health nurses who are already working in Dublin and who wish to transfer to provincial locations, including the west. In 2013 a similar issue arose prior to the graduation of the 2012-13 class. The parties accepted that this class would take priority over the existing panel for nationwide vacancies. Most of that class have been accommodated in locations that suit them and the current proposals provide for the remainder being accommodated up to the end of 2014. The proposals also provide a structure for the assignment of the 2013-14 class to posts in Dublin in the first instance and for the existing national panel to be prioritised for posts becoming vacant outside of Dublin. A significant proportion of new posts in recent years have been in the Dublin region and other urban locations, and this is likely to continue given service demands and population trends. As a consequence, the HSE is advising applicants that the 2014-15 class will be recruited on a basis that recognises the shift in demand for public health nurses when it comes to job opportunities. This information is being made available to each candidate at the start of the campaign.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I thank the Minister for his reply. I am aware of the negotiations between the INMO and the HSE. As the Minister explained, the situation is complicated by the existing panels and the demand in the greater Dublin area. However, there are people with young families who are not in a position to spend a period of time working in the Dublin area. These are existing HSE nursing staff who have participated in this diploma course. Will the members of the 2015-16 class be allowed to return to their original posts until such time as a vacancy arises in their regions? This is an issue affecting western counties such as Galway, Donegal, Kerry and Cork, as well as other counties, because nurses from those regions would be expected to work in Dublin. I ask the Minister to consider my request.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this matter, which he has raised with me separately on other occasions. I refer to the industrial relations issue between the HSE and the INMO, which is being dealt with by the LRC and in which I am not involved. There are also issues relating to staff deployment. In my view, one thing the Minister for Health should not do is to attempt to redeploy staff around the country. The health service has 98,000 staff and it would be quite improper for me to start relocating doctors, nurses and therapists from one part of the country to another. I have no intention of doing so. I acknowledge that professionals in the health service will express a preference for working in a certain part of the country, but the more important consideration is that patients need health service professionals and priority must be given to patient need over the preference of professionals.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	I appreciate that point. I ask if the Minister would consider making arrangements for those graduating in the next class. I will not go into the debate about the regional imbalance in the country whereby 50% of the population lives in the Leinster region and the resultant effects such as spiralling house prices. There needs to be a shift to the regions and a proper balance in the development of the country. I acknowledge the difficulties existing under the request I have outlined but I wish again to put on the record of the House the concerns of staff who want to take up these positions and who want to be part of the health service helping patients in their own locality. I refer to the big population in Galway and other urban centres in the west. These staff want a chance to treat patients in those localities.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	What are the factors behind the large increases in inpatient, day-case and outpatient waiting lists in the period January to July of this year? The National Treatment Purchase Fund published statistics quite recently and some of the increases these show make Zimbabwean inflation figures appear modest. In some areas there has been a 968% increase in the number of people awaiting procedures. What are the key reasons behind the increases to which I refer?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	The HSE is continuing to experience a significant increase in demand for its services, which is reflected in an upward trend reported in waiting lists for July 2014. The success of the outpatient initiative run by the HSE at the end of 2013, and further validation work in 2014, resulted in the facilitation of 33,000 extra outpatient appointments in 2013 and an additional 55,883 such appointments thus far in 2014. As the Deputy can see, there has been an increase in capacity. The success of the outpatient waiting list initiative last year in reducing the waiting list from over 100,000 in March 2013 to fewer than 5,000 in December 2013 has had the consequence of driving up inpatient and day-case waiting lists as patients are referred for appropriate treatment. In addition, other pressures such as almost 30,000 new cancer diagnoses each year are placing increasing demands - of the order of 3,000-6,000 additional referral requirements - on the system each month. Almost half of the 7,727 patients waiting over eight months for inpatient and day-case treatment are accounted for by three hospitals, namely, Beaumont, the Mater and Galway. There are several potential strategies hospitals can use when planning their resources most effectively around the delivery of the national access targets for their patients. For example, improvements in chronological scheduling, consistent validation of waiting lists and active engagement with patients to reduce "did not attend", or DNA, rates are under way in order to address outpatient waiting list. Similar measures, as well as optimisation of theatre capacity and day of surgery admission, where possible, are being employed to improve management of inpatient and day-case waiting lists. All hospitals have been asked to provide action plans to address all waiting lists by the HSE's national director of acute hospital services. These individual hospital plans will be monitored by the special delivery unit's scheduled care team.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	To the end of July more than 360,000 people were on outpatient waiting lists, an increase of almost 60,000 on the figure for last year. It is obvious, therefore, that something either is or is not happening, as the case may be. There comes a point where it is no longer possible to force that level of throughput through hospitals because they simply do not have the ability to deal with it as a result of a lack of theatre capacity, consultants and front-line staff. There is also an issue with regard to an inability to transfer people from acute hospitals to step-down facilities. The latter is because the Government, the Department and the HSE have simply not provided funding for such facilities in recent years. At any given time there can be between 600 and 700 people in our hospitals who should not be there and who should instead be being looked after in community settings - with access to home care packages - or in step-down facilities. It is one thing to make statements but there is also a need to put sufficient funding in place in order to ensure that our hospitals have the necessary capacity. Does the Minister agree that the special delivery unit appears to have run out of steam and that it also seems to be incapable of addressing outpatient and day case waiting lists? Will he take action to ensure that adequate funding is put in place, primarily in respect of step-down facilities, in order that people will be removed from acute hospital settings when they no longer need to be there?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	It is important to point out that even though there has been a significant increase in the number of those waiting more than eight months or a year, 89% of patients are waiting less than 12 months for access to outpatient treatment. The target is not being fully met but we have achieved a level of 89%. There is obviously a deficit in the context of step-down facilities, nursing homes and home-care packages. We do not offer enough home care and people here go to nursing homes sooner than they should and sooner than do their counterparts in other countries which provide much better social and home care than Ireland. Whether the funding available will be adequate is a matter for discussion in the coming weeks. As matters stand, there are approximately 700 delayed discharges across the acute hospitals. There will always be some delayed discharges - perhaps 200 to 300 - but a figure of 700 is quite remarkable.Were those patients in step-down facilities or nursing homes, we would not have the problems we have with overcrowding in emergency departments or delays in elective procedures. This is a major problem and it will cost a good deal of money to put right. I cannot say with any certainty whether that money will be available to me next year.

What we need in terms of policy is a stated commitment to ensure we will examine the issue in the acute hospital setting and the fact that we have up to 700 patients in beds on any one night who should be elsewhere. That is not only bad for hospitals but for patients also. They should be in step-down facilities or home care settings. What we have seen in terms of prioritising from the special delivery unit in recent times amounts to fire brigade action to address the difficulties. What we need is a sustained policy of funding home care packages to bolster the associated social and clinical supports and step-down facilities. This should be a priority. Otherwise we will be back here next year talking about an increase in the numbers on outpatient waiting lists and waiting as day cases. We need a sustained and coherent strategy covering several years.

That there are 700 mostly elderly patients awaiting discharge in hospitals is not only bad for the health service but it is also bad for those individuals because they are more at risk of acquiring an infection in hospital and falls. It is bad all round. It is frustrating that we have been talking about this issue for ten years. It is not something that has happened in recent weeks; it is not a sudden crisis. This is a chronic problem in the health service that has been ongoing since I was a medical student and I find it frustrating that we are still grappling with it. I will be working on the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we intend to put together an integrated plan to deal with it, starting with home care and moving all the way through the hospital system. This will have to be funded, which obviously will be a struggle.

It seems there has been a deterioration, not on the part of the staff who are doing an excellent job but in the ability to access beds and chemotherapy treatment. There were reports in the media during the summer about risk control. I know that the Minister has met some of the people involved in the cancer services in the context of the new review. Will he comment on the role of University Hospital Galway in the cancer strategy programme in the next ten years?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	University Hospital Galway is one of eight designated cancer centres in Ireland. Key performance indicators have been developed for referrals to cancer centres for breast, lung and prostate cancer with a view to ensuring consistent procedures and quality services for patients. For breast cancer, the target is that 95% of patients who are deemed to be urgent cases will be offered an appointment within ten days of receipt of the referral letter and that 95% of non-urgent cases will be offered an appointment within 12 weeks. All urgent patients referred to University Hospital Galway are being seen within the ten-day target period. In August this year 86% of non-urgent patients were seen within the target timeframe. While every effort is being made to achieve the target timeframe, a significant issue arising across the cancer centres is the increasing numbers of non-urgent referrals. Some of them are deemed to be inappropriate referrals and a focus is now being put on the better overall management of the referral process. For lung cancer, the target is that 95% of patients will be offered an appointment within ten days of receipt of the referral letter. In University Hospital Galway 60% of such referrals were seen within this very challenging timeframe in August. There have been some staffing pressures in nursing and clerical areas in University Hospital Galway in recent months and these are being addressed. Efforts are also being made to achieve an integrated team approach in the service. For prostate cancer, the target is that 90% of patients will be offered an appointment within 20 days of receipt of the referral letter. In Galway 51% were seen within the target timescale. There has been a considerable improvement in this figure since the start of the year and service provision is being reorganised in this area to maximise throughput. A new locum consultant will start work shortly and this will have a significant impact. A permanent appointment will be advertised in the coming months. Meanwhile, radiotherapy patients in Galway are being treated in a timely fashion and plans are in place to expand the radiation oncology facilities at the hospital to meet projected needs in the coming years. Comprehensive cancer treatment services are available in Galway and a concerted effort is being made to address pressures on treatment capacity as they arise.

I had sought information from the HSE in respect of the number of cases presenting, but trying to get information from the executive is like throwing a ball against a haystack. The Minister introduced a ten-day turnaround for all agencies to respond to parliamentary questions in his previous Department and I encourage him to consider doing that in his new Department. There is considerable pressure on chemotherapy clinics. Targets are being met, which is welcome, but the conditions people are being treated in are absolutely horrific. I have heard about several bad cases, including one in which a person receives chemotherapy standing up in order that the staff can keep to the schedule. People are left to wait for hours, some after travelling considerable distances to the hospital from across the region, and then they must leave Galway late at night to travel back home. With regard to the key performance indicator for prostate cancer, which is 51% in University Hospital Galway, when does the Minister hope to have a figure to measure the improvements he has outlined? This is Blue September, and prostate cancer has become one of the greatest cancer threats. It is not acceptable that one in two cases is not being dealt with within the timeframe. When does he hope to have an updated figure in this regard? How many of the new appointees to University Hospital Galway will be deployed in the cancer care unit? Will any of them be attached to Mayo General Hospital?

I am afraid I do not have all that information to hand. As the Deputy mentioned, I had a ten-day limit for answering parliamentary questions in my previous Department and that will be introduced in my new Department, although the timeframe will probably be 14 days, not ten. However, if parliamentary questions are not answered by the HSE, they will be followed up by my Department within that timeframe. The figures are done monthly and reported in arrears. I have given the Deputy the August figures. It is still September and, therefore, I cannot give him this month's figures, but I imagine they will be available in October.

That is one area causing considerable concern and distress among patients, especially given the distances people must travel. Staff in Hawkins House do not understand the distance element, particularly where people leave Galway following their treatment at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and have to travel across the region.

Sometimes everyone is told to turn up at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m., and that is not acceptable. I invited all the hospital managers to meet me approximately two weeks ago and one of the issues I specifically raised with them was that hospitals should give people realistic appointment times, every 15 minutes or every half an hour, and not just have everyone arrive at the same time. None of the managers said they had a problem with that, and I will follow this up with them when I meet them again in a few months.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I want to ask a number of questions regarding the appointment of Mr. John McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA. On Friday last, the Taoiseach issued an apology, saying: "I wouldn't say it was my finest hour and I take responsibility for this having evolved to what people might imagine it is." That apology calls for a far greater degree of clarification. People are wondering what exactly he was apologising for, because he did not say precisely. People did not imagine this; it happened. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht appointed Mr. McNulty to the board of IMMA, albeit for two weeks. In so doing, the Government used IMMA, an institution with considerable artistic status and an achievement on behalf of the country, as a political tool. He was clearly appointed to give him suitable qualifications to contest the Seanad by-election on the Cultural and Educational Panel. Despite the fact that the Minister wished Mr. McNulty every success in his tenure only last Tuesday in the Seanad, he resigned on Friday, which raises a question: how could he, in her words, "bring his considerable talents and abilities" to serve effectively a board that he could not serve on for longer than a couple of weeks? Will the Taoiseach clarify when it was decided that Mr. McNulty would be the Seanad by-election candidate? Did he or anybody on his behalf ask, direct or suggest to the Minister that Mr. McNulty be appointed to the board of IMMA? Why was it decided to appoint someone to the board of a national institution when it was clear that the person could not serve for longer than a few weeks? Why appoint someone who had not even applied for the position in question?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	Obviously, my acceptance of responsibility last Friday came in my capacity as uachtarán of the party that I lead, and I did so for two reasons. The first was that it was a case of bad judgment and not having followed through on the process that was put in place for the validation of persons who were looking for nomination to the Seanad by-election, and the second was not having followed through more quickly on the internal structures that we agreed at our think-in on Fota Island just a few weeks ago. It was for those reasons that I said I accepted responsibility for this. It happened on my watch. It was beneath the standards that I have always applied to the consideration of names for nomination to Seanad elections.The position is that, as president of the party, I let my own standards slip in that regard. I wanted to accept responsibility for that on Friday and did so.  In respect of the appointment to the board of IMMA, that was made by the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, exercising her right as the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in respect of examining the qualifications of Mr. McNulty, who is a completely innocent person in this regard. Mr. McNulty was formally nominated on 17 September.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	The Taoiseach has his views on the Seanad but, as he knows, it is a key part of the Constitution. He should apologise more fundamentally on those two counts and not, with the greatest respect, in respect of his role as leader of the Fine Gael Party, which suggests a self-absorption by him and his party that defies all logic and credibility. I find it incredible that this is the response we have received. I understand Mr. McNulty has withdrawn his candidature from the Seanad by-election process. If that is also the Taoiseach's understanding, will he confirm Mr. McNulty's decision? His withdrawal would illustrate more than anything else the debacle into which the Taoiseach and Minister plunged Mr. McNulty and the entire process. It is always a worry when people cannot answer straight questions in a simple manner or avoid answering questions for days, as we saw last week. I asked why someone would be appointed to the board of IMMA if that person could serve only two weeks on that board. Mr. McNulty was clearly not in a position to serve the board in any meaningful way. Why did that happen? I also asked the Taoiseach whether he asked the Minister to appoint Mr. McNulty or suggested to someone else that he or she suggest to the Minister that she appoint Mr. McNulty, or whether someone in the Fine Gael Party asked the Minister to appoint Mr. McNulty. Will the Taoiseach give me an answer to those questions? Where was the catalyst in this matter? Who asked the Minister to appoint Mr. McNulty given that, as was clear from the Minister's speech in the Seanad last week, Mr. McNulty did not apply for the job? In addition, he did not have any particular qualifications in the visual arts, contemporary modern art or anything like that which made him suitable.

These related to 29 persons, as some people were nominated more than once. There were, therefore, 29 people looking for the opportunity.

The renowned artist Robert Ballagh has stated that the record of the Government on the arts is the worst of any Government in the history of the State. Its attitude to appointments to the board of IMMA is a further illustration of this. A central plank of the Fine Gael Party's election platform in 2011 was one of political reform. In recent days, however, the Taoiseach attempted a political manoeuvre straight out of the Fianna Fáil handbook of political strokes.

Dhein an Taoiseach rudaí le déanaí nach raibh soiléir agus oscailte. Cleasaíocht a bhí ann. The Taoiseach first denied any responsibility for the controversy surrounding John McNulty's appointment to the board of IMMA. Having stated that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, had made the appointment, he then changed his story and indicated that he took full responsibility. Today, however, he has failed again to tell the Dáil what it is he took responsibility for, and he continues - or perhaps he does not - with his plan to place his man in the Seanad.  Tá trí cheist dáiríre agam. Ba mhaith liom freagra simplí agus soiléir a fháil. The Taoiseach appeared in his earlier response to admit that Fine Gael asked the Minister to appoint Mr. McNulty to the board of IMMA. Let me be clear about this. Did the Taoiseach or anyone working for him, or anyone on behalf of the party of which he is uachtarán, instruct or request the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to appoint Mr. John McNulty to the board of IMMA or is the Taoiseach making a Jesuitical distinction between his post as uachtarán of Fine Gael and as Taoiseach of the State?  Is the Taoiseach's claim that this was solely a matter for the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, inaccurate? Given what he has said earlier, is it untrue? If, as the Taoiseach says, Mr. McNulty is asking Oireachtas Members not to vote for him, does that mean he is withdrawing his name?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	My party has a structure in place for dealing with applications and the validation of candidates for all elections. There is a process through our executive council whereby that happens. This was set in place in the early part of the summer. A sub-committee of the executive council made a recommendation for a number of names to be considered for the Seanad, which was their responsibility. Subsequently, Deputy McGinley announced his retirement and I looked at the possibility of the appointment of a candidate for the Seanad from Donegal. My rationale was that this was a Fine Gael seat in the Seanad which was made vacant by the election of Senator Deirdre Clune to the European Parliament. For that reason that process was not followed, nor was I informed of the state of play of the validation exercise. Secondly, I accepted responsibility for taking my eye off this situation when I should have been more diligent about seeing it through. I have already said that publicly. As a follow through on that, without having any Jesuitical distinction between these two things, as Head of Government I have now put in place the structure and framework to deal with all appointments, non-remunerated and remunerated, to semi-State boards and other organisations so that will be entirely free of the political assessment before appointment. This is as it should be and I think it is something that everybody can support. The effective date of implementation is 1 November 2014.  I am not happy about the situation as it evolved in the Fine Gael process, nor was I informed of that situation. For those reasons I feel it is beneath the standards that I have set myself. It is beneath the trust placed in us by our supporters and is beyond the integrity of the way we fight elections. For that reason, I felt strongly that this seat should not be accepted in these circumstances. Mr. John McNulty, an excellent candidate in every respect, understands that and has therefore formally requested Oireachtas Members not to vote for him.

As Members know, the ballot papers are printed and the names are on them so it is not possible for Mr. McNulty to withdraw his name. He therefore formally requests Oireachtas Members not to vote for him.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	This is the candidate who is not a candidate. The Taoiseach said earlier that he was the first to accept responsibility for anything on that side of the House. I have to say that he made our friends in Fianna Fáil blush with that answer. Let us get real about all of this. There is a deep disillusionment among the general public about jobs for the Fine Gael boys. I note the absence of Labour Ministers here today. There is even the failure of Labour to face down such blatant cronyism at the heart of the Government. This is an abuse, or a possible abuse, of the public appointments process. The appointment to IMMA was, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, to secure a Seanad seat. It is an extremely serious matter, especially when it involves the Taoiseach, never mind his other persona as uachtarán of Fine Gael. Will the Taoiseach explain what public interest was served by John McNulty's appointment to the board of IMMA? How were the arts advanced by this appointment? Where are the accountability, transparency and openness in that appointment? Did the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, follow the Taoiseach's example by appointing a former Fine Gael councillor to the board of Irish Water? Was this done at the Taoiseach's request in either of his two capacities? In the absence of a Labour Minister, did the Labour Party follow suit by asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to appoint a former Labour Party councillor to the board of the Irish Aviation Authority?  Given what the Taoiseach has just said, and his stated wish to restore credibility - credibility which was undermined by him - would it not be better to cancel this election and re-run the election process?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	The election process is under way and cannot be stopped; it goes through to its conclusion. Candidates who are named on the ballot paper cannot withdraw their names. For that reason, given what I have said to the Deputy, Mr. McNulty has formally requested that people should not vote for him. When I speak of acceptance of responsibility I do so from this chair. I will not go into the history of a number of incidents that applied here. The appointment of Mr. McNulty in his own right to the board of IMMA brought with it business acumen, regionalisation and a different voice. A second appointment was made to IMMA on the same day for those reasons.

Assessments will be made on the appropriate skill levels required. In respect of the boards under their responsibility, every Minister will have to set out what are the requirements and credentials that people being appointed to these boards need. Where they are non-remunerated they all apply under the StateBoards.ie site for every Department. For instance, in the case of NewERA, where there are a number of specialist boards to be appointed, such as Ervia, Irish Water and Bord Gáis, it will be a matter for consultation with NewERA as to the specialist qualifications they need before applicants are invited and before they are determined for appointment by the Minister of the day. They will be ring-fenced for those companies. The same will apply in the case of other semi-States. It may well be that some persons may have to be asked specifically because of their particular credentials. After I spoke to Mr. McNulty I deemed him to be a person of first-class credentials and good character who would make an excellent representative.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	This week, people have been outraged by the most recent display of stroke politics. While that particular fiasco plays out, however, the Taoiseach has managed to pull off another fairly big stroke. That is, as of tomorrow, he has shifted the burden of taxation from the Exchequer balance sheet on to individual households by way of the introduction of water charges.The Government tried to force this on us by telling us that it was first and foremost an exercise in conservation. If that were true, every single person in the State, rather than every household, would have been given a free allowance, such that only wastage exceeding the allowance would be paid for. However, this is not about conservation; the goal is to develop a new funding model. It is a simple as that. Rich and poor will be treated equally and there is no real ability-to-pay clause. This morning's reports of average costs are essentially an opening salvo, but the caveat is that the rate will be capped only for the first nine months. By then, Irish Water will have achieved its stated aim of turning citizens into customers who will blindly accept their liability and pay water charges. Is that the Taoiseach's plan? To add further insult to injury, it has been decided that PPS numbers have to be applied. That was in the legislation. The numbers are no longer deemed to be personal. If one does not provide a PPS number, one is essentially fined by way of additional charges. That is what the commissioner said on "Morning Ireland" this morning. I have repeatedly heard people say to me they feel they are living in a dictatorship. I can understand why they are saying that. We are now in circumstances in which Irish Water has a more complete set of data available to it than any Department, which is crazy.

What assurances can the Taoiseach give people, both now and in the future, about the security of their personal information? How can he describe the system as a system of water conservation when everybody does not get a basic free allowance? Does he admit that the purpose of the water charges is not to conserve water but to transfer the burden of taxation from the Exchequer to the individual householder?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	The Government has made it clear for a very long time that the intention was to make water charges as fair, equitable and affordable as possible. Previously in the House, the Deputy spoke in favour of them herself. The regulator has determined today that the average water bill will be less than €240 per year. It is confirmed, further, that 80% of all bills will be less than €24 per month.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	133	We welcome the regulator's decision that a free annual allowance of 30,000 litres will be issued for water usage in every household and an additional 21,000 litres for every child under 18. Those who live alone, of whom there are many, will have approximately 40% of their water needs provided by the allowance. They will pay €138 per annum, or less than 50 cent per day. The 411,000 recipients of the household benefits package, including pensioners, carers and disability benefit recipients, will receive an additional allowance of €100 per year to assist with water costs. Charges will be capped for people with particular medical conditions who may require the use of a higher volume of water. The regulator has changed the condition in respect of boil water notices. There will be no payment required until 24 hours after the lifting of a notice.

For the Deputy's information, I understand that Sinn Féin has suddenly come forward with a brand new policy of keeping Irish Water but not having any water charges for domestic consumption. We should realise that this decision would require €850 million extra in cuts if the party were ever to get its hands on the levers of power.

What is happening here is not about conservation but about the transfer of a tax burden from the Exchequer to the individual householder. I refer to people who would not be in a position to pay the tax if it were levied under an income tax regime. The Taoiseach stated that Irish Water would not be sold. The State will not be selling it soon. Who is to say, however, that it cannot and will not be sold in the future? Legislation changes all the time. People do not believe it cannot be sold. One is required not only to provide the PPS number of adults in a household but also those of children. These numbers could potentially be used and sold as an asset, as I stated previously. What the Government is not telling us is that it is charging students with means-tested grants who are from households that are not wealthy. It is charging social welfare recipients - those under 25 - in receipt of just €100 per week. There are many categories for whom €130 represents a lot of money. It is a full week's income. The ability-to-pay clause has not been included. It is not a conservation measure and I challenge the Taoiseach to tell me that it is.

Some €1.2 billion in costs are funded by the taxpayer and around 40% of the water is leaking away. Around 20,000 people are subject to boil-water notices. Three or four dozen treatment works are substandard and need to be attended to. There is a requirement for major regional infrastructure throughout the country. The Deputy made reference to the greater Dublin area in particular. Clearly, the investment of approximately €300 million per year is less than 50% of what has been required to deal with this. This was the reason for the Government's decision to set up Irish Water as an entity that could borrow-----

The PPS numbers are used to determine the number of children in a household and who is receiving allowances in respect of children. They are used to determine the appropriate allowance to be granted, including for children. Irish Water will not be sold, and that is enshrined in law, as is the protection of the data in respect of PPS numbers. The data can be used only for the purpose intended. Clearly, the regulator's decisions and announcements today have been broadly accepted by people-----

They will get used to a changed culture in respect of the use of water. People in Roscommon who see the works on water treatment infrastructure will be very glad to see an end to boil water notices, which have applied in that county for over ten years in some cases.

In the week that is in it, when the Taoiseach wove such a tangled web that he does not really know where he stands by using and abusing a public institution and State body - the Irish Museum of Modern Art - what changes is he going to make in regard to putting the public services and the use of those institutions to advance the political interests of the major right wing parties in this State beyond the reach of sleaze, cronyism and favouritism? Is this a subject he thinks the Cabinet sub-committee should take up? As it was the Irish Museum of Modern Art the Taoiseach abused, would he consider offering himself as an artistic installation there for a day, perhaps by going down and standing in stocks in sackcloth and ashes as atonement for his abuse of that institution?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	The Government made a decision this morning, in respect of a memo brought forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to deal with the changing of the model and structure by which ministerial appointments will be made. This has been agreed and approved by the Government. All of the positions on boards will be advertised openly on the State's portal, StateBoards.ie, which is operated by the Public Appointments Service, PAS. This means that every Minister will, in respect of the boards under the aegis of the Department, be required to set out the criteria, the conditions and the skills necessary for service on any of those boards. It is expected that every Department will advertise its vacancies and those criteria on the StateBoards.ie service. While the appointments to the board will remain exclusively the responsibility of the Minister, the relevant statutory conditions will have been assessed elsewhere. For instance, where a number of non-remunerated vacancies might exist on a board, a Minister will receive a list of appropriately approved candidates with qualifications from the Public Appointments Service for consideration. In the case of boards under the aegis of NewERA, we have ESB, Ervia, Bord na Móna, Coillte, EirGrid and Irish Water. Bord Gáis and Irish Water become Ervia. These are specialist commercial entities which require a specialist set of skills, perhaps accountancy, legal expertise, communications or data skills. These will be assessed, in consultation with NewERA, to verify what is being sought and the vacancies on these boards will be ring-fenced to the NewERA system. The Minister of Finance has responsibility for a number of boards concerned with the Central Bank and a process of validation is required for those appointments.  The result of this will be that from 1 November this year, an entirely new regime applies. All of the public appointments advertised on StateBoards.ie will be vetted and validated in respect of the conditions set out for each of the boards under each Department and the Ministers will be supplied with a list of named, qualified, credible persons. This process will apply from 1 November. I do not propose to take up the suggestion made by the Deputy.

Why are the proposals he has just made, which I have not yet had the opportunity to study, being proposed for 1 November, some three and a half years after he stood and promised his democratic revolution and the cleaning up of politics? Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party are up to their necks in the cronyism stakes, with failed or unsuccessful council candidates for the Labour Party finishing up on boards and sitting councillors finishing up on other boards.

What the Government is doing now is what Mr. Haughey and the rest of them and other Governments did over the past 40 years, yet it is three and a half years into office and it is now promising that from 1 November this business will be cleaned up. Can anybody believe there is any credibility attaching to that?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has pointed out on many occasions, there has been a raft of reforms here, including those on lobbying, the Ombudsman, FOI and StateBoards.ie. In respect of StateBoards.ie, an excess of 60 individual campaigns was undertaken, involving 2,500 expressions of interest - approximately 40 candidates per campaign. Some 200 appointments have been made from that system. In approximately one-fifth of the campaigns, no appointments were made from PAS applicants. In general, the PAS process related to from one to two vacancies on each State board. By 1 November, every Department will have set out the criteria, standards and skills necessary for persons to serve on their boards and all of this information is transferred onto StateBoards.ie. This means the public will be have a transparent, accessible way of understanding the vacancies, the places to be filled, the criteria necessary and how to make an application. These applications will be assessed by the Public Appointments Service and not by any internal, political dynamic. Credible, qualified candidate names will then be submitted to the Minister in question for consideration. The exclusive responsibility for the appointment lies with each Minister, but this system-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	The Taoiseach has outlined reforms on the nomination or appointments of citizens to the various State board, but we will wait to see the detail of these reforms before giving our view on them. This brings into sharp focus the function of the Cabinet sub-committee on public reform. The Taoiseach appeared earlier to accept that Mr. McNulty's appointment to the board of IMMA was an abuse of the public appointments process and that has led the Taoiseach to bring in these reforms. I asked the Taoiseach earlier about the appointment of a former Fine Gael councillor to the board of Uisce Éireann - he happened to pick the example of Uisce Éireann as perhaps being a board that required some particular talents or skills. Can he tell us what particular skills this former Fine Gael councillor brought to that-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	We are straying a long way from the question, which was about the meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee that took place.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	I am just trying to understand how all of this works. The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, also appointed a former Labour Party councillor to the Irish Aviation Authority, and the Taoiseach did not answer any of those questions when I asked him that earlier.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	162	They can be brought up directly in another question.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	163	All right. Can the Taoiseach outline the role and purpose of this Cabinet sub-committee, particularly in the light of this recent debacle, and how he sees it working within the overall Government structure?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	I point out to the Deputy that the Cabinet sub-committee has already published two reports in respect of over 200 individual actions, and they are available for him to read, if he wishes. The role of the sub-committee is to provide a basis for cross-departmental co-ordination in the areas of social exclusion, social inclusion, poverty reduction and service delivery, including providing assurance about coherence in the engagement across Departments with all of the different target groups. The combination of social policy issues with the public service reform agenda will ensure that questions about how services should be reconfigured and tailored to guarantee their effectiveness will certainly be something that is of critical analysis. For example, we had a very good meeting yesterday where the publication of a national dementia strategy was discussed and approved and where the national drugs strategy was considered in regard to how that should evolve beyond 2015 and 2016 in order to make preparations for dealing with the challenges that are there. The Cabinet sub-committee has done and is doing a great deal of work in these areas of social inclusion, poverty and homelessness, which obviously has implications for the greater Dublin area in particular but also in so many other areas around the country, where there are also homeless people and housing issues.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	In regard to this question, and given what the Taoiseach said earlier in terms of the Minister, Deputy Howlin's announcement today, I point out that we had a similar announcement three and a half years ago. The Labour Party manifesto in 2011 stated it would:...end the system whereby appointments to State boards are used as a form of political patronage and for rewarding insiders. In future, appointment to boards must be based on a demonstrable capacity to do the job.The Fine Gael manifesto stated something similar. All political parties since the foundation of the State have appointed either members of the party or associates of the party to State boards - that is a fact. I can go through the first ten years, having studied it myself, and we can see what went on. Even today in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin does it quite regularly-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	Name names.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	There is the case of the Minister, Conor Murphy, and the appointment of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir to the board of Northern Ireland Water. I believe there were other appointments which ended up in legal wrangles due to the shenanigans that went on. I could say there are many quangos and community boards in Northern Ireland that have the Sinn Féin imprint. I am just making a statement. All political parties have been involved in it in Northern Ireland, in the Republic and in all democracies. The big difference was that everyone signed up for a different politics at the last general election but the rhetoric that was articulated then and since has not matched the reality of what has happened. That is the point. The McNulty appointment is not actually about political patronage. It is a more profound issue of how a distinguished arts institution was undermined by the process of appointment. He was appointed not because he could serve the board; he was appointed in order to qualify him to run for the Seanad. That was the more fundamental issue which, in my view, separates it from the, if one likes, normal system for State appointments, which needs to be changed.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	Is there a question? This is a speech.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	The parliamentary question was asked by Deputy Robert Troy in July last and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced the changes today. However, to take his own Department, where I acknowledge there were only 22 appointments to two boards up to July, not one of them was of a public applicant. That is 0% in the percentage of public applicants------
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	What were the two boards?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	This is from a parliamentary reply. I do not know the boards.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	They are the ones that were statutorily provided for. One is the Public Appointments Service, PAS.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	To continue, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government made 177 appointments yet the number of vacancies advertised was nil and the number of public applicants selected was nil. I do not know what the then Minister, Mr. Hogan, was doing but he clearly did not believe in any of the rhetoric from before the election or any of the principles that both parties announced would be the basis for making public appointments. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources made 108 appointments since March 2011 and the number of vacancies advertised was nil, although 17 public applicants were selected. Out of 120 appointments made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, 28 were public appointments. Therefore, while different Ministries had different outcomes, we are looking at the most at one out of every five appointments across all Ministries being of public applicants. Huge lip service is paid to all the talk about public advertising. The question is how valuable is this Cabinet sub-committee on public service reform, given all this was going on over the past three and a half years under its watchful gaze? The Minister has said that all future vacancies will be advertised on the State boards portal and that it "will be processed by way of a transparent assessment designed and implemented by the independent Public Appointments Service (PAS) to support the relevant Minister". Does this mean the Minister will still end up making the appointments?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	Therefore, the power resides with the Minister anyway.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	176	That is the law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	177	Yes, but the Government is not changing that fundamental point. I am just trying to get clarity. There is a lot of smoke. All of this was said three and a half years ago and the performance did not match the rhetoric - that is the point I am making. How do we know that now, following today's announcement, it is going to be any different for the next year and a half? Clearly, some Ministers ignored completely the principles outlined by the Taoiseach, particularly the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, which more or less ignored what the Government was claiming it was doing with public sector appointments. Would we be better off abolishing the committee? Does the Taoiseach think there is any point in it meeting?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	Does the Deputy read the reports of the committee?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	No, I do not agree at all with that. The Cabinet sub-committee, as he is aware, is able to bring together different personnel from different Departments with a view to focusing on particular issues like homelessness, dementia or other social inclusion areas that need to be dealt with, be it anything from the post office network on. The Deputy asked how we can now be sure this is going to happen. First, the Government will continue on with what it has already been doing in terms of ending corporate donations, radically reforming the local government structure, the reduction in the number of authorities from 114 to 31, the banning of political expenses, State cars, increments and pension entitlements, all of which has been done, as well as the introduction of gender quotas and the establishment of a constitutional convention, with a number of reports to come before the House. Between now and 1 November, whatever appointments have to be made to boards, the Ministers will announce those publicly - in other words, Minister X might say, "We have three vacancies on board X". Rather than having to find out what actually applies, from 1 November, as the Minister pointed out, all of this will be clear on StateBoards.ie and all Departments will have set out the criteria for serving on the boards under their responsibility. As vacancies occur and people apply, that vetting process by PAS will be available to the Minister of the day. He or she still retains exclusive responsibility for the appointment of members to the board but those members in such cases are vetted, validated and certified as being competent people to serve on the boards in question. It is a different model. It is a much more effective, streamlined and co-ordinated system and the public can check for themselves what vacancies are occurring on what boards, the criteria that apply and how they might apply if they wish to participate in that public service.That is different from the others that are ring-fenced for NewERA or the commercial semi-State bodies where particular sets of skills might be required to serve on those boards.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	180	In answering Deputy Joe Higgins's questions the Government has failed to see the point. We cannot pass judgment on the actual criteria used yet because we have not seen them. However, the problem is fundamental and it is this what the Taoiseach should be tackling. It is the fact that since the foundation of the State, the Minister has had the ultimate responsibility and Ministers, from whatever party, have continuously abused their right to patronage. There is absolutely no reason to believe that by setting new criteria, this abuse will not continue. This sounds suspiciously like the way judges are appointed. In a similar situation - over which a Government fell in the past - a body called the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was set up. It is known in the Law Library as "JAABs for the boys". It was cosmetic legislation to fool the public as camouflage that something was changing in the appointment of judges. Nothing has changed. We still get nominees from a board and the Minister has the responsibility. Ministers from all sides have continuously abused that responsibility by appointing their cronies to the Judiciary.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	Which judges does the Deputy have in mind?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	I do not think I am allowed to name them and it would be utterly subversive and wrong if I were to do so. For a Minister to suggest it is very wrong.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	Will the Taoiseach, please, forget about the camouflage, the criteria and the bodies he put in the middle? Will he announce in this House that the problem has been ministerial appointments and that he intends, as a great reformer and part of a great reforming Government, to end the system whereby Ministers have the facility to appoint their friends and cronies to State bodies? Take it out of the political arena and we will then believe him. Say, "Yes, the system has ended" because he knows from what happened when on this side of the House and this side of the House knows from what is happening on the other side, that no Government has been able to resist the temptation of abusing this responsibility and that there is absolutely no reason to believe the camouflage about which we are about to hear will fulfil that objective.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	There is actually because the people who apply on StateBoards.ie apply on the basis that they know on which board they would like to serve and the conditions, criteria and skills set necessary to serve on such a board. It is not the Minister who assesses their validity to fit the criteria but the Public Appointments Service system. When it comes back to the Minister with a list of names, they are all deemed to be credible and suitably and appropriately qualified. When the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board comes before the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality, the candidates have been assessed by the President of the High Court and an eminent panel. Obviously, they know them better than anybody else in terms of their qualifications and experience. Seven judges were appointed to the Court of Civil Appeal and the appointments were made by the President-designate, the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court. That list of eminent judges came before the Cabinet and was approved unanimously; therefore, things have changed; they are not the same as they were.  What the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has done is set out an entirely new model for State appointments to remove that element of politics such that all appointments will be credible and all appointees will be qualified and appropriate for appointment. It may well be that a Minister may say in keeping with his or her exclusive responsibility, "These people are well known or you do not have enough suitable applicants for what I think we need." Perhaps other applications come through on StateBoards.ie. It is a genuine attempt to transform a system that has been very unclear for many years to a position of clarity, assessment, validation and selection for service on the boards in question. As I said in respect of the Court of Civil Appeal, the seven member panel was selected by very eminent legal personnel.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	It is very important for the Taoiseach to comment on the employment of a member of the board of Irish Water as a personal driver for one of his Ministers. Does this not show contempt for an already outraged people who are facing water charges from today? He appointed a member of Fine Gael who already held down two jobs in Waterford where 20% of the people were unemployed. That is appalling and outrageous. This is the only appropriate place in which I can bring the matter to the Taoiseach's attention. If he listened to the radio this morning and people in Waterford, he will know that they are completely outraged that this has happened. A man who already holds down two jobs and is a member of Fine Gael and a member of the board of Irish Water will be paid €625 a week to drive one of the Taoiseach's Ministers of State around. It is appalling.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I ask the Deputy to, please, resume his seat.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	Did he take Irish Water with him by any chance?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 24, inclusive, together.  I attended European Council meetings in June, July and August. The main purpose of the special European Council in August was to elect a new President of the European Council and appoint the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. I am very pleased that the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Federica Mogherini, were selected for these key positions. I have worked closely with Donald Tusk in his capacity as Prime Minister in the past few years and believe his experience and professionalism will serve the Union well. I have told him that I look forward to working closely with him in driving forward the agenda of growth, jobs and investment. I take the opportunity to record my thanks to the outgoing President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and the outgoing High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, who have guided the Union through some very difficult times in the past five years. While I did not have separate bilateral meetings with Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Renzi or President Hollande at the August European Council, I did, of course, engage with all of my colleagues during the course of discussions, including those to whom I have just referred. I also met Chancellor Merkel during my visit to Berlin in July. My replies to previous questions about that visit are on the record of the House. I have not had a specific meeting with the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, recently. However, he participates regularly at European Council meetings when core economic issues are discussed. At the European Council meeting in August we discussed the economic and employment situation in the Union. We reiterated the need to progress the country-specific recommendations under the European Semester and implement the strategic agenda agreed at the European Council in June. We will return to these issues at the European Council and the Euro Summit in October which President Draghi will also attend. During the European Councils in June, July and August and on the margins of these meetings I engaged in discussions with a number of colleagues about Ireland's economic situation, as well as about broader European economic issues. The possible use of the European Stability Mechanism for bank recapitalisation was not up for discussion at these European Council meetings, but it is for consideration by finance Ministers. At the July meeting of the European Council Heads of State and Governments repeated their call on Russia to actively use its influence over illegally armed groups and to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border with Ukraine in order to de-escalate the situation rapidly. The Council regretted the lack of progress on four key steps set out at the June meeting and agreed to take a number of new measures in response to the deteriorating situation in the area. A special European Council meeting on 30 August took place against a backdrop of a very serious intensification of fighting in eastern Ukraine in the previous two weeks. The meeting included a discussion with President Poroshenko. The European Council condemned the increased flow of fighters and weapons from Russia into the Donbas region, as well as the aggression of Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil, and called for their immediate withdrawal. We reiterated the importance of implementing President Porosheko's peace plan without delay and set out the essential actions required to achieve this.  The European Council also requested the Commission and the European External Action Service to present proposals for further restrictive measures against Russia within seven days for its consideration. These measures which reinforce the restrictions already in place since July were adopted on 8 September and entered into force on 12 September. We also called on all parties to support the UN-led international relief effort aimed at providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance for the local civilian population. The European Council conclusions reiterated the urgent need for a sustainable political solution based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence. While the emergency Foreign Affairs Council in August focused on recent events in Gaza, the special meeting of the European Council in late August adopted conclusions which flowed from the Foreign Affairs Council welcoming the recent ceasefire and stressing, in particular, that efforts must continue to bring about an end to the closure regime operated by Israel, an improvement in the condition of the people in Gaza and an end to the rocket attacks on Israel. The Council reiterated the European Union's willingness to assist in Gaza and stated Gaza must be part of the comprehensive resolution of the conflict in a two-state solution. Further humanitarian and reconstruction aid for Gaza will be discussed at an international conference in Cairo on 12 October.  The European Council in August also expressed concern about the crisis caused by the ebola virus in Africa and stressed the importance of the international community as a whole providing substantial co-ordinated support for the countries of the region, NGOs and the World Health Organization to help them to tackle the disease as swiftly and effectively as possible. The European Council welcomed the additional funds provided by the European Union and its member states and their efforts to provide further financial and human resources to meet, in particular, the increased demands for experts in local areas. The European Council paid tribute to the efforts of humanitarian and health workers on the front line. It called for increased co-ordination at EU level in the assistance provided by EU member states and invited the Council to adopt a comprehensive EU framework response to address the crisis. I have answered questions on the special meeting of Heads of State and Government in Brussels in May and these replies are included in the Official Report.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	After the euro area summit in June 2012, the Minister made lavish claims in the Dáil that this meant one of the euro financial mechanisms would be used to replace the massive €64 billion Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, followed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, had forced Irish taxpayers to pay to bail out the European financial market system. That was two years and a number of months ago. Why did this not feature at the summit on which the Taoiseach reported to us? Where are the funds? Where is the relief that was promised? When the Taoiseach and the former Tánaiste came here to talk about seismic changes and earth-shattering events, we thought a tsunami of relief was to follow shortly. Not one cent has been seen and I ask the Taoiseach for an explanation. Has the position and future of Hong Kong featured at EU summit level in the recent period? I am sure the Taoiseach knows that China is declaring that its Stalinist totalitarianism will be imposed on the people of Hong Kong who, in particular the youth but also wide ranges of the population, are in revolt and absolutely correct to be so. Is the Taoiseach embarrassed about this recent development, as he feted the Chinese leadership and failed to criticise the nature of the regime when it visited Ireland? There is massive repression at the diktat of the Chinese regime and we cannot rule out the possibility that a horror like what happened at Tiananmen Square could be visited on Hong Kong, either before or after the 2017 elections. Will the matter feature in upcoming meetings? Is it an issue on which the Taoiseach will engage and raise at meetings?  I refer to the horrors and atrocities visited on the people of Gaza by the overwhelming miliary power of and bombardment by the Israeli regime. How do the Taoiseach and his fellow EU leaders justify Israel being a favoured state of the European Union as far as trade issues are concerned? How does he justify the weak-kneed, cowardly, dishonest and hypocritical failure of the European Union to call what the Israeli regime is doing in Gaza by its name?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	The situation in Hong Kong was not discussed at the European Council meeting. It had not erupted in the manner it has in more recent times. I deplore that kind of activity and hope the situation can be stabilised quickly. There is no doubt that it will be discussed in the future. On the question of finances, the banking union structure has continued to be put in place at official level and towards the end of the year the stability mechanism and banking union will be in place. It will then be a question of considering what is the best option for recapitalisation. The taxpayer put €4 billion into Bank of Ireland and received €6 billion in return and it still owns 15% of the entity. The appropriate time for it to be disposed of is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Finance and the Government in due course. The same applies to AIB. The option of deciding which entity would give the best return to the taxpayer remains. The option of being able to pursue the process of direct recapitalisation of the banks remains open and on the table, all of the elements having been completed. In regard to the situation in Gaza, we were appalled by it all summer.The loss of life was not acceptable under any circumstances. Ireland has consistently warned that if this was not resolved it would lead to a new outbreak of exceptional violence, which happened with loss of life, particularly on the Gaza side, following the shootings in the West Bank. The situation has stabilised somewhat, but the place is destroyed. There is an exceptional requirement for reconstruction funds to bring in material to rebuild the many thousands of dwellings and houses that have been flattened in Gaza. The ceasefire on 26 August brought about some sense of stability, and I noticed the reaction of the people in Gaza to that. Political discussions must continue. The attitude and the political position of the different groups from Hamas to so many others is an issue that requires constant analysis because of the changing nature of what is happening there. It is unacceptable to have had a continuation of attacks from Israel into Gaza. I could never understand why one would hear comments that they were investigating incidents in which schools were hit and comments as to whether stocks of arms were held in United Nations buildings. It always struck me that the United Nations is doing a remarkable job out there and clearly those buildings should be sacrosanct for the purposes for which they are intended. How they could become places for arms to be stocked is something I could never get to grips with. The ceasefire is tenuous. It is another beginning, with thousands of lives having been lost. It is not appropriate that the acquisition of land on the West Bank and the building of very significant numbers of houses and apartments continue without restriction. The European Union and the international community must be focused on this. I note, for the attention of Deputy Joe Higgins, from the discussions which took place at the European Council that 1 million people have fled from Syria into southern Lebanon and a million people have moved from Syria into Jordan, and they have had all sorts of humanitarian crises in Syria. There is a civil war in effect in Libya, and we have ISIS or ISIL and the other challenging issues that apply across the greater Middle East region, including the extermination of Christian communities and the Christian population at Mosul, formerly Nineveh. Deputy Higgins will be aware that the UN Human Rights Council has appointed a panel of inquiry to examine breaches of human rights in the recent conflict, and I am sure it will find many. We support the council and its work on this. Ireland supported an investigation, and now that the panel has been established, I am not sure whether any other format will be brought forward. The position has been grossly unacceptable and we hope the tenuous ceasefire that is now in place can continue and that these people in a devastated area can have some sense of family living. It is a couple of years since I was out there, but one has to go there, as the Deputy knows himself, to see the extent of the devastation - flattened buildings, unemployed young people and the struggles they have to deal with every day under different regimes, always with the awareness that another incursion might take place. This was an issue that was raised also. The financial position and issues with regard to repayments were raised. I note for information the approval, of which the Deputy will be aware, that has been given from our European colleagues for the early purchase of IMF loan repayments. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and his team did an excellent job here. Ireland borrowed €22.5 billion at 5% from the IMF, the most expensive portion of which is the €18.3 billion portion which is subject to the IMF's highest credit surcharge. It makes practical common sense that if we can borrow at much lower rates than applied previously, there is an opportunity to buy out the loans. Thanks be to God we can, as the rates currently available on the international markets are well below the 5% level. Our ten-year bond in Ireland is now less than 2%. By buying out the loans at a lesser charge, we can save the taxpayer approximately €1.5 billion over a five-year period. That would be a positive indicator for Europe, a very significant advance for Ireland and a very worthwhile saving for the taxpayer here due to the emergence of the country as a stronger and more competitive economic unit. We are grateful to our EU colleagues for that. Under the terms of each of Ireland's loan agreements with the EFSF, the ESM and the three bilateral lenders - the UK, Sweden and Denmark - we were supposed to pay back those loans at the same time as making repayments on the IMF loans. However, at the meeting of 12 and 13 September, Ministers expressed broad support for Ireland's proposal, as did the bilateral lenders. For some member states, this approval is subject to the necessity of reverting to their national parliaments for parliamentary approval and authorisation. That is being done. For the EFSF loans, the Eurogroup mandated the euro working group to take this proposal forward while ECOFIN mandated the economic and financial committee to do likewise. The Minister for Finance wrote to the EFSF, the ESM and the three bilateral lenders on 19 September to formally request their agreement to our proposal to repay up to €18.3 billion of our IMF loans ahead of schedule and to the waiving of the mandatory proportionate repayment clauses set out in each of the loan documents. Once the national procedures are adopted, it will be possible for Ireland to start discussions with the IMF on the detailed arrangements for early repayment. I am sure Deputy Higgins welcomes that.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	I will be as brief as I can, but I note that this is not a satisfactory way to do business. I asked a number of questions of the Taoiseach about Gaza and the onslaught there and he did not answer one of them in his response. We all know that more than 2,000 people were killed by the Israeli Defence Forces, including more than 500 children, and that the Israeli Government is in breach of international law, humanitarian law and criminal law. The question is what the people of Palestine are to do. If the international community stands back and does not uphold the rights of citizens there, the Israeli Government will continue to do what it is doing. The Taoiseach said in his remarks that the international community must be focused on this, but our Government is not focused on it. Our Government, this State and the island of Ireland could be leaders in conflict resolution and the promotion of human rights globally, but we are not. We have the shameful decision by the Government to abstain on a UN vote calling for an investigation into war crimes during the slad on Gaza. It is beyond comprehension that we abstained on that issue. Similarly, while the Government recognises the mission of the State of Palestine in Ireland, it does not provide it with the same privileges, immunities, exemptions and facilities granted to other diplomatic missions in Dublin pursuant to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. In response to a question I asked, I was told that a formal recognition of the Palestinian state and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations should take place in the context of a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.That is not good enough. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that we become champions of peace in the Middle East, that we stand up for the rights of the people of Israel, particularly those who are the victims, and for the rights of the people of Palestine. He can do that by affording full diplomatic status to the Palestinian mission in Ireland and raising all those issues in a consistent and ongoing way. I note the response to what is happening in Ukraine is markedly different from what is happening in the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and the onslaught upon the people of the Palestinian territories.

We should do it thematically - Gaza, Palestine, Ukraine separately-----
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	Maybe, yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	-----and the debt issue separately. Whoever decided to group them should have at least divided them up in that way because this is totally unsatisfactory. First, in terms of the debt issue and the retrospective debt, for three and a half years the Taoiseach and the Government defined relief on banking debt as European agreement on retrospectively funding the debts that were effectively imposed on Ireland. In fact, two senior Ministers went so far as to say that up to €60 billion could be retrieved in such a manner. That followed the famous 2012 meeting when Mario Monti and those others forced Chancellor Merkel's hand but what we have witnessed since then essentially has been the unravelling of that decision. The Taoiseach has completely changed tack and the idea of getting such a sizeable retrospective deal has abated; he has given up on that. He now uses vague language to do with existing options, and no one quite knows what those options are. There was always an option to sell the banks later on. That was never off the table, but that was not the point. The point was that Europe imposed a solution in Ireland at a time when Europe itself did not have solutions for what was a wider eurozone crisis, not just an Irish crisis. That is at the kernel of this, and it did not treat Ireland fairly. The former Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said that the 2012 meeting was a game changer. It has not turned out to be a game changer. Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the European leaders are not prepared to do a deal on Ireland's debt retrospectively? The separation of sovereign and banking debt, which was proclaimed, will not be retrospective. Can the Taoiseach give a straight answer regarding what he is being told now by Chancellor Merkel and others? Second, regarding the Palestinian crisis and the appalling strategy being taken by the Israeli Government, we have condemned the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel but those rocket attacks were no justification for the declaration of war on Palestine, and on Gaza in particular, by the Israeli Government. It cannot bomb with impunity and do those kinds of military operations without killing many innocent women and children, and innocent civilians generally. What was appalling was the lack of any pulling back when innocent children running across a beach were murdered. To be honest, the Taoiseach pulled his punches in terms of the UN committee on human rights but there was a lack of unequivocal condemnation of that kind of activity emanating, in my view, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and from others. I got the sense that there was a decided lack of comfort within Government circles about what was transpiring and how to react to it. There comes a time when we have to say that the use of such lethal force on a civilian population had no justification and was a disproportionate response to what was happening. There is a sense that the Government has a particular position on this debate than that it had three and a half years ago in that it was far more tolerant of Israeli strategy, which I believe is a flawed strategy. I have no difficulty in terms of Israel as a state in the sense that I recognise its right to exist and I recognise the two-state solution as the ideal solution, but I am not sure Israel believes in a two-state solution. I am not sure that its political strategy is designed to achieve that. In fact, one would have to come to the conclusion that its political strategy is to do the exact opposite. The recent announcements in terms of further land settlements is flying in the face of United Nations rules, regulations and law and makes it far more difficult to ever have a two-state solution or a Palestinian state that has the capacity to be effective as a Palestinian state. All the Israeli strategy succeeds in doing is undermining moderate opinion within Gaza and moderate opinion within the West Bank, and undermines Abbas and his Government, Fayyad and all those who showed that progress could be made if there was some dialogue. It is almost as if Israel has a vested interest in ensuring that the extremes stay vibrant and in existence. People may disagree with my position on that but that is my sense of it. There is an urgency for Europe in that regard. The UN Secretary General summed it up when the conflict ended when he asked - "What do we do now?". Do we rebuild it yet again? How many more hundreds of millions of people will come from Europe to rebuild Gaza for another war in two years' time, which will level everything again? I recall being at Foreign Affairs Council meetings at which Tony Blair said the sewage treatment plant would be rebuilt. None of the promises made after the flotilla disasters, which the Taoiseach might remember, have been kept. It is an appalling crime against humanity that an entire population is imprisoned to the degree it is, and western states and the European states have not called it what it is, for a range of reasons. It is time some countries within the European Council, including Ireland, spoke a few truths now and again about this issue. I ask the Taoiseach to give me some indication of what transpired at the summit meeting with regard to that issue. Third, regarding Ukraine, I welcome the Taoiseach's support for the tough sanctions against Russia in terms of its aggression against a neighbouring state. The Sinn Féin leader said there seemed to be a different response from the Government side to Gaza than there would be to Ukraine. One could make the same statement about Sinn Féin's stance in terms of Gaza and Ukraine.

The Taoiseach should always remember, and I hope he would agree with me, that the association agreement was the No. 1 item on President Poroshenko's election programme when he won an overwhelming majority in Ukraine. He has full democratic legitimacy, and he should be accepted as such, but for some reason Sinn Féin does not accept it. Russia has behaved as an aggressive imperial power.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	215	The Deputy is refusing to call it what it is, and that only encourages President Putin in terms of further aggression. I ask the Taoiseach to assure us that Ireland will continue to stand with the people of states threatened by Russian aggression. It is a very serious issue in that part of the world because they have experienced terrible events in the past and they do not want to go back to that. My final question is on Ebola in west Africa. Europe and the developed states have not responded with the urgency necessary from the outset of this crisis. It is an appalling, devastating crisis, not only in terms of Ebola itself. The entire public health system in Sierra Leone, west Africa and across the entire continent is in danger of collapsing. There will be far more deaths from malaria, maternal mortality and other conditions because people are no longer turning up to hospitals. Hospitals are closing. Health staff have left because of the impact of Ebola. People are not taking medicines or going onto the system. I acknowledge that the Government has donated €600,000. He might see if Irish Aid could do more and if the public health community in Ireland could meet with a view to determining if there is anything they could do on a more practical level to assist the international effort.This is a public health crisis of extraordinary consequence and demands a far greater international response then it has received to date. 
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	My question concerns double standards when it comes to the way Europe deals with the situation faced by Palestinians, and the people of Gaza in particular, in the wake of the recent assault by Israel on Gaza. I would like the Taoiseach to explain how on earth the EU can continue to confer trade privileges and effective associate EU membership on Israel, contribute €840 million in recent years to Israel to develop weapons and missile systems through the EU scientific research programme and continue to allow the EU to be largest trading partner of Israel by a mile. We give them trade privileges, unprecedented access to EU funds and we contribute directly to the development of weaponry and military research that Israel uses against Palestinians in what François Hollande described as a massacre. The president of an EU state described what they did to the UN school as a massacre. The Russell tribunal met in the past week in Brussels and found that Israel's Operation Protective Edge displayed evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of murder, extermination, persecution and incitement to genocide. It does not get much more serious than that yet the EU confers trade privileges on a state accused of these things. At what point do diplomatic niceties, realpolitik and blind submission to the diktats of the wider EU and its strategic interests give way to standing up and showing moral backbone and saying it is no longer acceptable to treat as a normal state and confer privileges and trade benefits on a state guilty of massacres and accused of genocidal action? The same European Union can, in an instant, impose sanctions on Russia. I absolutely condemn what Russia is doing in Ukraine but nobody is accusing Russia of genocide. Israel is being accused of genocide and there is no question that it engaged in massacres yet we do nothing. When will the Taoiseach speak out and stop hiding behind EU silence and the claim that it is a decision for the EU? Will Ireland speak out about this and say it is not good enough that genocidal assaults over many years are being conducted against the people of Gaza and we continue not just to treat Israel as a normal state but to confer privilege on it? It is an extraordinary moral contradiction and I ask the Taoiseach to explain it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	It is just not good enough. Deputy Martin raised Gaza as well. It is a country surrounded by Arab countries and on three occasions in the past 30 or 40 years a two-state solution was offered but rejected because of the inability of Arab nations to get agreement on this very controversial situation. It is unacceptable in any circumstances that, as pointed out by Deputy Micheál Martin, disproportionate use of lethal force should be directed at a confined entity like Gaza. Ireland has been forthright in unreservedly condemning that scale of attack and also condemning the rockets from Gaza indiscriminately fired into places in Israel. Ireland has its experience and the professionalism of our troops serving in the UN based on our proven capacity to do things differently in the case of conflict resolution, including decommissioning weapons and building tenuous peace. I was speaking to someone yesterday who was in Belfast 25 years ago and I asked him what he thought. He said that the walls are higher and that it is not the way it used to be despite the fact that things were difficult then. Deputy Gerry Adams is aware of the discussions to be led by both Governments that may bring about a renewed sense of activity about what we must do in Northern Ireland. I share the view of Deputies Boyd Barrett and Micheál Martin on the question of water, accommodation and the scale of reconstruction funds that must go in to Gaza for the nth time. The blockade of its seaward side and its sea fishing exits is crushing people. This is a case of attempting a different kind of conflict resolution but it must involve the capacity to reach out to different forces. The question of decommissioning is an issue. Ebola has frightened millions of people listening to international newscasters. If people contract symptoms that look like ebola and decide to leave the local region, they carry this with them. The capacity to beat this is obviously there and it may be that countries allocating money for humanitarian aid may be better off giving a proportion of it to the World Health Organisation, which has the logistical capacity to deal with it but not have the funds. Countries with good intent allocate funding for humanitarian works. A portion of it might be better spent by the World Health Organisation to deal with rehydration of people and developing the capacity to treat people locally rather than have them travel long distances where the disease can spread. My layman's understanding of this is that it can peter out with proper treatment but new movement brings about a resurgence and causes major anxiety. With regard to Deputy Martin's comment about the Irish aid already given, we will see whether something else can be made available. President Poroshenko was very forthright at the European Council meeting, as was the response from the European Council in respect of the extra sanctions implemented within seven days. Europe became serious in terms of these very wealthy individuals who are being seriously compromised by these sanctions. With regard to the grouping of the questions, I will look into that matter. The June 2012 decision still stands and Ireland is one of the few countries that could make a claim for recapitalisation under that decision. It was not possible to do anything until the banking resolution and banking union mechanisms were put in place, which will be from November. The Government will make its decision on the best option.The Deputy is correct in that the option of the sale back of the banks was always available. With direct recapitalisation, it took a hell of an amount of complex and tortuous discussion and negotiations to get to the present point. It is now being finalised and is the subject of decisions by countries if they wish to make a claim under it.  The Government will make its decisions in due course on the testing of the value of banks or the option of pursuing the question of the decision of 2012, which is still there and very much on the table.

The Taoiseach is proposing to ram through the House without debate double taxation relief agreements with five countries on the day that the European Union Commission, which is as right-wing and neoliberal a body as one could find, says that successive Irish Governments have allowed Apple, a major multinational, to siphon off billions of euro from the Irish taxpayer into private corporate profits to satisfy corporate greed? This is being proposed on the very day we are told that an average family of four over-18s will have a new water tax in this State of almost €500 per year. Irish Water says it will be €483 for four people aged 18 or over, based on data that Irish Water has not shared with us - we do not know where it comes from - which states that the average usage is 88 litres per person per day, when the two major studies sponsored by governments show an average usage of 148 litres per person per day, and Denmark, which is by far the most efficient country, has a usage of 114 litres per person per day. There has been a very significant under-estimation of usage. From tomorrow, families of four and more will face anything up to €1,000 per year in a savage new austerity tax to continue the bailout of bankers and bondholders. I do not want to let this proposal go through without debate. I want a debate on why this Government allows multinationals to walk away with billions when working-class people, low and middle-income workers, students, pensioners and the unemployed are saddled with a savage new austerity double taxation. I agree with double taxation relief agreements, but let us start with the Irish taxpayer. When this week will the House be afforded an opportunity for a major debate on this new draconian imposition on our people and on tax fiddling by multinationals? Then we can agree to the proposal.

However, I asked before the summer recess for a comprehensive debate, because there seems to be a determined effort to undermine Ireland's ability to have an independent taxation regime which is fully in compliance with international tax law. We cannot sort out the world on our own. I have witnessed over the years the prevarication on climate change and the global inability of countries to sign off on agreements designed to copperfasten a regime for dealing with climate change. How are we to anticipate that the same will not happen with regard to a very tight and equally applicable global taxation regime? If that is the case, we need to be careful about how we proceed. I remind the House that 166,000 people work in multinationals in Ireland.

The OECD is an important body but it does not have international jurisdiction; it is an advisory body which can make recommendations and undertake research. However, I am conscious of the fact - and surprised - that of late it has become the stormtrooper-----

There is much I dislike about globalisation - wage rates across the world, the absence of any conformity with health and safety requirements and the lack of any adherence to consumer rights. Let us introduce a dose of realism to this debate. I put it to the Taoiseach that the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, was out of order at a Conservative Party conference to have a cut off Ireland-----

The Commission has issued an opinion and there is a long road to travel in respect of it. Let us not just accept everything with absolute acquiescence.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	These matters were discussed by the Select sub-Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week. The select sub-committee did not take a vote on them. Ireland has double taxation agreements with 71 countries. It is important to state it participated fully in the discussions which took place at the European Council meeting on the OECD's response on the base erosion profit-shifting issue. While I have a very good relationship with the British Prime Minister, I am aware that the Tory Party conference is taking place. The OECD's report is now available and decisions must be made on what is the best option to take. The Minister for Finance is giving very careful consideration to that matter. It is true that 166,000 people work for multinationals with operations in Ireland. I had the privilege of opening a section of the Apple plant in Cork, at which an extraordinary number of very highly qualified people work. The same applies at other locations throughout the country. We should not forget this. It is important to say - regardless of whatever decision is made - that the report did not focus to any extent on the rate tax involved - 12.5%.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	That is because it is never levied at 12.5%.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	246	In Ireland's case - as is the position with all other countries - whatever global decisions are made and when the elements beyond the corporation tax rate are stripped away, there are still exceptional opportunities in terms of our talent pool, track record and technology. I have no problem in conceding to a comprehensive debate on this issue which is fundamentally important in the context of the economy, lines of foreign direct investment and exports. The Whip will make the arrangements for the holding of such a debate when it is appropriate to do so.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	I have previously raised with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business the issue of extreme obesity and the lack of funding available for surgery for those who are at high risk in this regard. As he is aware, funding stopped halfway through the year. It has now emerged that, instead of funding operations in St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin and University Hospital Galway, the HSE is flying patients to the United Kingdom for surgical treatment at a cost of €15,000. The cost of such operations here is approximately €10,000. I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this makes no economic sense whatsoever. Is he in a position to confirm that this issue will be examined in order that surgery might be performed here rather than in the United Kingdom? In that context, when will the health reform Bill be published? The question of obesity is one of fundamental concern in the context of the future. The Children and Family Relationships Bill was originally published in draft form by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, last January and welcomed by most, including the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who issued a press release at the time in which she stated this complex and sensitive legislation would assist in making all children equal. In her current capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality, however, she published the actual Children and Family Relationships Bill on Friday last and has excluded the section on surrogacy. In January the Government - through the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter - launched the general scheme of the Bill which included a section that would have provided legal clarity on the parentage of children born through assisted human reproduction and surrogacy and granted "court oversight in the making of declarations of parentage in order to ensure future arrangements consensual, altruistic and non-commercial". Surrogacy was mentioned on 97 occasions in the general scheme published in January, but there is not one reference to it in the Bill published on Friday last. On promised legislation, the Government previously indicated that the issue of surrogacy would be dealt with. Why has the section contained in the original general scheme been excluded from the Bill published by the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald? When can we expect the promised legislation on surrogacy? Reports today indicate that the banks are lending up to four and a half times the combined incomes of couples seeking to purchase houses. These reports do not make for very comfortable reading. House prices in Dublin are rising fast and are currently up by 25%. There is going to be a continued shortage of housing. People are going to be pushed into extreme positions and further mortgage distress if there is no intervention on the part of the Government. When can we expect the credit guarantee (amendment) Bill to be published? Are there further proposed legislative measures to deal with the housing issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	The credit guarantee (amendment) Bill is due this session. Under its regulations, the ECB does not allow banks to lend more than 60% of what is required. I find the report which indicates that the banks here are lending up to four and a half times a couple's combined income extraordinary. We will obtain a report on the matter. The Bill, as stated, will be published this session. I may have referred earlier to the fact that yesterday the combined Cabinet sub-committee considered the question of mortgages and extra opportunities for credit. Incentives are to be considered in the context of getting the construction sector moving. I have not seen the reports on patients being flown to Britain or other countries in order to have operations relating to obesity. I will obtain a report on the matter for the Deputy. The Children and Family Relationships Bill was cleared and published last week. The Bill is necessary in order that we might have a clear run at the marriage equality referendum due to be held next year. The Government is not afraid to tackle the issue of surrogacy. However, it must be remembered that this is an exceptionally complex area. I am concerned that if it is dealt with in the context of the Children and Family Relationships Bill, the process would be delayed and it would not be possible to ask a clear question in the context of the marriage equality referendum. I will obtain an update for the Deputy on the nature of the complexities that have to be dealt with in this instance. From what I have heard, it is exceptionally difficult to deal with this matter in any short-term fashion. Ireland is a particular case in point in the context of surrogacy, particularly in view of the lack of regulation here. It is important that we get it right.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	On the commitments contained in the programme for Government and in the context of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it has emerged - in response to a query from an Teachta Pearse Doherty - that a Minister of the Government, the Attorney General or a Minister of State who maintains a second residence shall be granted a deduction in respect of water charges under the dual abode allowance provision. Effectively, this means that Ministers such as the Taoiseach will pay no water charges in respect of their second homes. This on a day when citizens will be shocked to hear that their water bills will be vastly higher than the Government previously signalled.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	Is legislation promised in this area?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I stay in a small apartment not far from here and received my notice from Irish Water. I do not believe the apartment is metered, unless it is done on a central basis. I have been asking questions about the matter. Obviously, I intend to pay whatever my water charge will be. I have not come across an arrangement for amending the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. However, I will obtain a report on the matter for the Deputy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	When will the heads of the health reform Bill be published? A great many reforms are required in the health sector.On Tuesday last week outside Wexford General Hospital four ambulances were queueing to deliver patients but there were not enough staff in the hospital at the time to take in the patients. There are only five ambulances in the county. Surely the scenario of four of them queueing to deliver patients and not enough staff in the hospital to take them is unacceptable.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	The health reform Bill is a major piece of work that the Minister is looking at. There are several blockages in the system in respect of patients being taken in. This is about hospital management, as Deputy Wallace is well aware. Over the coming period the new Minister for Health will report on the progress of the health reform Bill and perhaps bring the committee up-to-date. Deputy Wallace could inquire by way of a Topical Issue or a question in the House. I will advise the Minister of Deputy Wallace's interest in the question.

One is the long-awaited Construction Contracts Bill, which we have heard so much noise about. Many small businesses have been forced out of business and this is continuing. It is farcical at this stage that the Bill is not yet introduced. In the justice area there is a plan to establish a dedicated family court structure. There have been three cases recently where the courts have locked out family members, colleagues and other supporters in cases where the banks are trying to repossess people's homes. It happened in Waterford yesterday, it happened in Trim already and it has happened before in Dublin. People are entitled to justice. The courts locked out members of the National Union of Journalists and members of the press, who I am not here to speak for. Anyway, justice should be carried out in public. Is this coming from Government or where is it coming from? The banks are doing dirty work and are getting obstructed by people genuinely making their case in the court, standing up and defending themselves. In many cases they cannot afford legal representatives. When family members and friends tried to go in yesterday they were locked out and treated like criminals. This is an alarming situation. I call on the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice and Equality to deal with the matter. It is simply not good enough that people are not allowed to attend court. These are family members and those who want to support people in a lay capacity.

I assume the Deputy is referring to a recent dispute with a construction firm not too far from here. I will send Deputy McGrath an up-to-date report on the current situation. There is no date for the publication of the family courts Bill as yet.

Following the Government's introduction of the very unfair water tax, is it now proposing to drop the broadcasting levy that it was to introduce? My second question relates to the health reform Bill. I remind the Taoiseach of the crisis that is going on in our hospitals, including Kerry General Hospital, where the nurses are under extremely tough and difficult pressure to try to take care of patients every day.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	The broadcasting Bill is due for early next year. The health situation is always challenging, especially with a very substantial overrun this year. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is now engaged with officials from his Department as well as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials to try to work out the best option for the budget for 2015. I have already answered Deputy Wallace in respect of the health reform Bill. I do not have a date for it. It is one of the major restructuring elements of the health system.

The Bill allows for the amalgamation of the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority. Specifically, it will allow for preplanning consultations to take place between the NRA and An Bord Pleanála in advance of the construction of roads. In the recent past we have seen in places like Adare, County Limerick, that when preplanning consultations were not allowed, An Bord Pleanála refused to allow permission to be granted for the route of the bypass. We anticipate that the new Bill will rectify that issue. When is the next stage proposed to be taken?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	That is waiting to go to committee for Committee Stage. The Department will normally contact the committee and make arrangements for the relevant sections to be dealt with. I will advise the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of the Deputy's request and see what its contact with the committee is.

These were people who had held them on discretionary medical grounds. The process was to take three weeks. It is now four months later and there are still thousands of people who have not had their cards restored. When will that process finish? When will the committee of experts that was set up at the time to address this issue report? Has it reported? Will the report be placed before the House? In particular, when will the cards be restored to the thousands of people who, four months later, still have not got their cards back?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	I thought the vast majority of people had had their cards restored following the Government decision. As I understand it, the Minister has not yet received the Keane report into the matter but it is due to be sent to him shortly. Obviously, he will examine that, assess the report's analysis and findings and bring it before Government and the House in due course.

Fuel is being tampered with to derive more profit. Is it necessary for the Minister for Finance to introduce legislation to allow for unannounced inspections of retail outlets to try to tackle this problem? There are serious financial implications for car owners. Engines are being damaged and they have had to be replaced in many vehicles.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	275	Some 500 engines have blown in the west because of this. Deputies Mulherin and O'Mahony raised this as a Topical Issue some weeks ago. If Deputy Kirk reads the Official Report he will find the response and the action that is being taken to deal with it. I understand that was two weeks ago.

It is to protect children and vulnerable persons against sexual exploitation and abuse. Is it intended to have the legislation passed by the end of this session? Another Bill which I have raised in the past is the bail Bill, the imminence of which seems to have dropped in recent times. Notwithstanding that compelling reasons for a review of the bail laws abide as much as ever, what is likely to happen in respect of that Bill? Is it likely to come before the House within the next 12 months? Is it likely to be passed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	The criminal law (sexual offences) Bill is due this session. I hope that it might get through and be passed but it depends on the backlog of legislation to be dealt with. The heads of the bail Bill have been approved but I cannot give Deputy Durkan a date for it.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	Two budgets ago the Government introduced an increase to the pupil-teacher ratio for all schools with four teachers or fewer. This is having a detrimental effect on many schools in rural Ireland and those of minority faiths. This was done in advance of the Department carrying out an independent evaluation on the schools. I understand the Department has had the report for the past 18 months or more. The relevant Minister is beside the Taoiseach in the House. Can the Taoiseach confirm when the report will be laid before the House? When will all Members have an opportunity to discuss the report? My second point relates to a promise the Government made in the programme for Government in respect of care of older people and community care.It states: "Investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority for this Government". Can I ask, with regard to St. Christopher's Care Centre, Longford-----

We are in the extraordinary position in which the chairman of the independent fiscal council is threatening resignation because he is so frustrated at having that body's advice repeatedly ignored by the Government. Will the Taoiseach consider a transparent, open debate in this Chamber and at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in advance of the budget to ensure that the views of those bodies are heard, that both Opposition and Government Members can be heard and that the Government can have an opportunity to explain itself in advance of the budget and not after the fact?

I also thank the Minister for attending. This is a serious issue relating to pupil-teacher ratios, PTRs, in two schools. The first is Donaghpatrick national school in Caherlistrane, north Galway. When the school forwarded its enrolment numbers to the Department a number of months ago, it had the correct number to secure an additional developmental teaching post. However, through no fault of the school, a family had to leave the area for economic reasons, reducing the number of pupils by three. Unfortunately, that has left the school in a terrible predicament whereby it will lose the developmental post at the end of October. The concern for the school is that this will result in a class of 42 students in junior and senior infants, which is unacceptable. This is also causing a great deal of concern for parents. To add insult to injury, the post will be given back to the school next year and, therefore, for the sake of four or five months, 42 students will be put together in one classroom. It is unacceptable and I would like the Department to demonstrate some flexibility in retaining the teacher and taking the pressure off the teachers and pupils. The second school is Cappataggle national school near Ballinasloe, County Galway. This relates to the changes in the PTR for two-, three- and four-teacher schools in rural areas. If the school enrolment remains as it is, the school will lose a teacher next September. This is unbelievable, because the State pumped a great deal of money into the school a number of years ago. If the post is lost, the two classrooms that the money was invested in will no longer have a teacher or students. I acknowledge that budgetary measures have been implemented, but could the PTR for 2013 be used? This would give the school an opportunity to retain its allocation. We need a review of how teachers are allocated. It makes no sense to remove a teacher from Donaghpatrick national school when the post will be given back to the school next September.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue and I thank the Minister for being present to reply to the debate. I regret that she has declined my numerous requests since August to meet to discuss this matter, but I have an opportunity now. Since the measures were announced in budget 2012, I have worked hard to have some reversed and to have their impact eased, with some success, through, for example, the introduction of the appeals process. However, the impact on schools has been profound and it has led to huge difficulties. In particular, geographically isolated schools, which will never have the option of amalgamation and are far away from the nearest other schools, have been hit hard. The Department's message at the time the changes were introduced was that the entire process would encourage amalgamation.For a small number of schools, mainly on the western seaboard, amalgamation will never be an option. Lauragh national school, on the Beara Peninsula in my constituency, is located on a stretch of 26 km where there are no other primary schools. It has lost its second teacher because it has 17 pupils, which falls below the threshold of 20. It would be easy for the Department to allow a geographically isolated school to appeal its staffing allocation on the grounds that it is isolated. The Department's appeals board could then consider each appeal on its merits. Unfortunately, the Department is not showing any flexibility in this matter. I have been informed that the issue cannot be discussed until the value for money report has been published, which is an unacceptable position. Children living in geographically isolated communities are not any less important than children living in urban environments. This matter could be addressed with the stroke of a pen. I ask the Minister to act. The appeals process was introduced without any great difficulty and this issue could also be rectified. Unfortunately, it has not been addressed and children are suffering as a result.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	I thank Deputies Paul Connaughton and Brendan Griffin for raising this important issue. I apologise that I was not able to attend the House to discuss this issue last week. The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I were both appearing before the Select Committee on Education and Skills to discuss the Estimates. I note, however, that Deputy Brendan Griffin spoke about this issue earlier in the summer when he explained to me the position on small schools in his locality. The staffing arrangements for primary schools include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional classroom posts on developing grounds. These are not the types of school the Deputies have highlighted. In addition, a staffing appeals process is available to schools, including a new criterion for the 2014-15 school year which is aimed at schools that make a significant contribution to absorbing demographic growth. The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and they will continue to be a feature of the education landscape. The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools. It is worth noting that more than two thirds of the 3,200 primary schools have more than 86 pupils and, therefore, a much higher average class size than all of the schools affected by this measure. For example, a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of one teacher for 16 pupils. In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils. Nevertheless, I accept Deputy Paul Connaughton's point that teachers in smaller schools must teach a number of different classes.  Notwithstanding the phased increases implemented in the period between 2012 and 2014, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s. An appeals process is available to small schools affected by this budget change. A school with four classroom teachers or fewer which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the budget 2012 measures can submit an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board. Details on the appeals process are widely available.  I acknowledge that specific issues arise in respect of populations that are geographically spread out, including those to which the Deputies referred. How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small communities presents a particular challenge, especially in localities where school enrolment is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there are no other schools in the locality.  The value for money examination of small schools was referred to on the Order of Business. The document specifically addresses the issue of the location of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type. I intend to publish the report as soon as I have discussed it with my Government colleagues. The report is under active consideration. I am aware that the issue the Deputies raise presents a significant problem in areas where the population is widely dispersed. The Government will consider the matter.

I accept that she is new to her brief and wish her luck in it. On the specific case I raised, the removal of a developmental post at the end of October will create a class of 42 students and the post will be reinstated next September. This does not make sense. We hear of improvements in the budgetary position. The problem in this case is a lack of flexibility. Someone must engage with the school and understand the concerns of parents. The developmental post should be retained for the rest of the year and established on a permanent basis thereafter. On Cappataggle national school, I ask the Minister to freeze the pupil-teacher ratio at its 2013 level to allow the school to retain a teacher. It would be pointless to turn this discussion into an urban versus rural debate. The Department is under pressure and we must try to relieve the pressure on schools by maintaining the pupil-teacher ratio, which has been increased, at its current level.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	On Deputy Paul Connaughton's final point, which he made very well, perhaps the changes made in budget 2012 might have merit if urban schools were deriving significant benefits from them. That is not the case, however. In 2012-13 the Department saved €2.6 million before tax from the new measures related to smaller schools. The figure will decline to €2.2 million in 2014-15. At best, the measures saved €1.5 million after tax, which is a pittance in the context of the departmental budget. They are, however, having a profound impact on small, rural communities and not benefiting larger schools. This issue needs to be cleared up immediately. I have been hearing about the value for money report on small schools for the past three years. One of the first questions I tabled on my election to the Dáil was to ask when the report would be published. Rural communities must be given an opportunity to scrutinise and dissect the report and contest its findings. The Department is hiding behind it and taking what could almost be described as a threatening approach to those who raise issues about small schools by stating it will publish the report. Given that the report will probably be leaked a few weeks before the election, it would be better to publish it now and have an honest debate on it. It is unacceptable that it has been held back for the past three years, during which communities with small schools have suffered. In one school in south County Kerry only one teacher is available for 17 children across eight streams. Amalgamation is not an option for that school and a handful of other geographically isolated schools. With political will, this matter could be addressed overnight. I ask the Minister again to do so.

I am aware of a school in an urban area that is in precisely the same position as Donaghpatrick national school in County Galway. For demographic reasons, it too will lose and subsequently have reinstated a development post. The issue in such cases is that demographics in the locality are changing from one year to the next. In asking me to freeze the pupil-teacher ratio Deputy Paul Connaughton is asking me to pre-empt a budgetary decision. As he is aware, as a Minister, I am unable to do this. A budget will be announced in two weeks.  I will be pleased to publish the value for money report once I have discussed it with my Government colleagues. I agree with Deputy Brendan Griffin that a public debate is needed on the issue. The report has been completed, but the Government has not yet agreed to publish it. I must, first, have a discussion with my colleagues before I can publish it. I acknowledge, however, that a specific issue arises in isolated geographical areas where amalgamation is not an option because the distances between schools are too large and the number of children is too small. We will address the issue.

It is a pity that the Minister for Education and Skills has left the Chamber as the issue I raise also relates to education. Children from certain household backgrounds are more likely to die young, experience poor health and have literacy problems, yet educational supports for such children have been targeted for cuts. The background to this issue is that for the past six months meetings have been held in a number of local communities to highlight and explain to public representatives what is coming down the track. For the last six years there has been a 33% cut in the school completion programme. Those schools are now asking for a halt to those cuts. They hear statements from the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the effect that things will change but they have not seen that happen.  I have visited a number of schools in my constituency recently, including St. Mark's, St. Maelruain's and St. Dominic's, as well as others in Old Bawn, East Tallaght, Killinarden, Brookfield, Fettercairn and Jobstown. Those schools have wall charts of all the different things on their programmes but one could see that after six years those programmes had been gutted and filleted. The schools are saying that the cuts have to stop. The cuts are affecting the most marginalised students and their families. More cuts is the message coming from the Minister's new agency, Tusla. Talk is cheap but action is really important. Every euro taken from these programmes is a huge loss to society and a kick in the teeth for those communities. How can the Minister stand over these cuts? Most of us in this House - some of us more strongly than others - believe in the idea of an inclusive and progressive society but that is not happening. Over the last six years, such school programmes have gone backwards instead of progressing.  In real terms, it will mean fewer people attending third level education. Recent figures showed that in Dublin 24 some 16% of school students continue to third-level education, whereas literally down the road in Dublin 6 some 99% of students continue to third level. That is the sort of divide that exists in our society. It comes down to the fact that if children leave school early they have nowhere to go. They will not go into well paid jobs. Many of them will be hanging around street corners while some will get involved in drug dealing and other criminal activity. It makes sense to provide such supports, including monitoring school attendance.  The OECD has reported that 93% of young people complete second-level education in Ireland compared to the OECD average of 84%. People around the world are examining the Irish model, so what have we got right? We are literally filleting it and tearing it up.  I hope the Minister will have some answers. Everyone will be looking at the next budget but some schools have already been told that this year's cut is 6.5%. As I said earlier, there has been a 33% cut in the school completion programme in the past six years. It is very hard to stand over this.  Given the Minister's message, are we really sincere about trying to keep young people at school through the school completion programme? If so, we will have to change direction and stop this drift away from the programme.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	I thank the Deputy for raising this question. I wish to confirm that we are very serious about this matter. The aims of the school completion programme are to help young people stay in the formal education system until they complete senior cycle, as well as generally improving their school attendance and participation in education. The programme is a targeted intervention for schools identified through the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion of the Department of Education and Skills. The school completion programme involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives, operating across 470 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools. It provides targeted supports to some 36,000 children and young people who may be at risk of educational disadvantage. Every project in the school completion programme is managed and directed by a local management committee, which includes representatives of schools, parents and other education stakeholders in the locality. The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy they need to devise creative and innovative approaches to effectively address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. Projects provide a range of targeted supports, including homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, and social and personal development programmes for young people. In addition, a number of out-of-school supports including music, art and sports are provided, as well as a range of activities during holiday periods. As with all major spending programmes, the school completion programme budget was examined in the context of the 2011 comprehensive review of expenditure. This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014. In 2014, an allocation of €24.76 million has been provided for the programme. Since its establishment at the beginning of this year, the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including allocating funds to projects within the programme. This process requires local projects to develop annual school retention plans, with detailed service proposals for the forthcoming school year. Allocations to projects are determined on the basis of these school retention plans, while having regard to the savings requirements set out in the 201 I comprehensive review of expenditure. I am advised that the agency has completed the detailed process of evaluating and approving the school retention plans prepared by individual projects for 2014-15 and that the first instalment of funding under the programme issued to projects in the first week of September. Further instalments will issue in December 2014 and May-June 2015. The Child and Family Agency will continue to work closely with local management committees, schools and local school completion programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process. The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the Estimates and budgetary process, and the resources available to Government. The Deputy may be aware that a review of the school completion programme is currently under way, which is an important initiative in relation to the future development of the programme. The objectives of the review are to identify best practice in providing support to children and young people to stay in school; clarify the roles and responsibilities of those involved in the programme; and build upon the valuable learning and experience acquired to date. It is envisaged that this work will be completed during the 2014-15 academic year. The review should help to identify any reforms that are needed to put the programme on a sustainable footing for the future. Most importantly, the findings of the review will be critical to ensuring that funding is directed to those services that provide the greatest contribution to better outcomes and brighter futures for vulnerable children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage.

It is not just a problem in urban areas but also in rural ones. I hoped that something positive would come out of the Minister's speech and he said there will be a review, which is grand. However, many boards of management involved in the school completion programme have told me that they cannot continue. No programme can sustain a 33% cut over a number of years. It sends the wrong message concerning the school completion programme. We are doing a similar thing in the drugs area but that is an argument for another day. The whole idea of the programme is to give support to disadvantaged students. According to the attendance levels, it would appear that the programme is working. However, the level of incremental cuts over the past six years is now impacting on such services, so it has to stop. It may be a budgetary argument but the situation is not sustainable. Teachers and students in the relevant schools want the programme to continue working. I am appealing to the Minister to go forward instead of going back, but in order to progress the programme needs to be funded. I welcome any review in that regard. The school completion programme will stand up to any peer review.Ultimately, we need to send to those communities a positive message that education is the way forward, that it is not set aside for a small elite in society and that there is a place for every child if he or she wants to proceed to further education. We genuinely believe in the concept of lifelong learning, but the children in question are only at the beginning and need the required supports. Will the Minister, in his new position, commit to championing the cause of those children who have been left behind and are disadvantaged through no fault of their own? Many come from a background in which we failed their families and parents. This is a challenge for the Minister and his new Department, but it is one he should take up.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	316	I am sure the Deputy will agree that we all want to see all children reach their full potential. We want those who are particularly vulnerable and at risk of losing out through leaving education early in life to be supported in the best way possible. The schools inclusion programme is a huge part of this process. There have been cuts because, as we know, the country found itself in a bailout having lost its financial sovereignty. However, we are now out of the bailout programme and will certainly do everything in our power to protect the school completion programme. However, Government expenditure in this area is not limited to that programme. Nearly €49 million has been spent on various youth services programmes to offer support to young people all around the country. There is no doubt but that we could not do without these youth organisations and the tens of thousands of volunteers who work in this area supporting children and programmes, not to mention the tens of thousands of volunteers in the sports organisations who help to keep children occupied and engaged in healthy and physical activity that is to their benefit. We certainly have not targeted this area for cuts, but it has been one that has had to endure cuts. It is an area in which I firmly believe it is worth investing. Money spent on prevention reduces expenditure on treatment in a general sense, but nowhere is the gain greater than with children. Certainly, from our point of view and in our budget negotiations, this has been to the fore in our minds. We want to continue to support children to get the best out of the education system and support them when they are getting into trouble. There are many programmes in addition to the one in question, including Garda diversion programmes, which help to achieve that end.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	This issue arises on the back of the tragic and unnecessary death of Dhara Kivlehan which really saddened people throughout the country. She was a young woman in her prime and had just given birth to her first baby. The real tragedy is that this was not an isolated incident. Unfortunately, Dhara was the latest in a long list of others, including Savita Halappanavar, Nora Hyland, Bimbo Onanuga and Tanya McCabe. There have been inquests in Sligo and investigations in Portlaoise, in the middle of which are women hoping their giving birth to their children will be a joyous occasion. All of the occurrences in question happened under the watch of the HSE. There is a systemic crisis in maternity care, for two reasons. First, the cutbacks have meant that not a single maternity hospital is operating to safe ratios. Critically, however, our policies are wrong. We have an outdated antenatal policy that has not been changed for years. We should be seeking to develop a country-wide strategy involving midwifery-led units; instead, the HSE is actively pursuing midwives. I find it sickening that on the same day that the verdict of death by medical misadventure was given against Sligo hospital, where a midwife said she could not tell a patient had jaundice because she was Indian, an independent midwife with 31 years of stalwart experience, Ms Philomena Canning, had her State indemnity insurance withdrawn consequent to a decision handed down in the courts. All afternoon I have been receiving e-mails from people who worked with Ms Canning and women for whom she acted or has been acting as midwife. Her crime was not killing somebody or doing something which led to somebody's death; rather, it was that, while observing all procedures and protocols, she transferred a woman to hospital after a home birth when that woman felt dizzy. That woman was discharged ten hours later and she and her baby were fine. Owing to the actions of the HSE, there are ten women – many of whom are about to give birth imminently – who do not have a midwife. This is really serious, particularly when one notes the list of fatalities in hospitals under the direction of the HSE. Nobody was suspended, let alone fired. Ms Canning has devoted her life to women and proper birthing in which women have a choice. The policy is completely wrong and the Minister must consider a decent and proper system of maternity care.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Michael Kivlehan and his family on their tragic loss. Mr. Kivlehan's perseverance in having the hearing held in the Republic did the State a great service in the sense that it has brought to light some of the issues regarding the death of his wife, Dhara. It was unacceptable in first instance that efforts were made not to have an inquest. It was said the inquest should be held in Belfast because that was where Dhara had died, but, thankfully, through the perseverance of Michael, his family and legal representatives, an inquest was held here. The information that has emerged on the care offered to Dhara in Sligo leaves a lot of questions unanswered on the longer term issues concerning maternity services, not only in Sligo but also across the country. Ms Eilish O'Regan wrote an article in the Irish Independent today on the lack of information emerging from maternity services. We have raised this issue before on foot of the cases of Tanya McCabe, Savita Halappanavar and others who died while giving birth or just thereafter. Ms O'Regan states:The blunt statement was made by Phelim Quinn, who is now acting head of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), when he was launching its report on the death of Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway. He revealed that some maternity units have not even provided annual reports to give basic statistics and reveal how and why any babies or mothers died in their care. Maternity services have existed largely under the radar until the case of Savita and earlier this year revelations of four similar baby deaths in Portlaoise hospital since 2006. The full details of the tragic case of Dhara Kivlehan, who died in Sligo General Hospital, would probably never have come to light had it not been for her brave husband Michael.In general, we have very safe maternity services in this country, but there is still a problem regarding the collation of data on incidents and ensuring monitoring and proper oversight. We cannot continually blame staff when there are huge pressures on the system. There are systemic failures in the system regarding intensive care beds. A lack of such beds was identified during the inquest. We do not yet have a centralised system for intensive care bed allocation such that patients can be transferred to the place where the most appropriate care is available. We owe it to Dhara and the other women who have, unfortunately, died tragically to put in place safe services. Most important, we owe it to those women who are pregnant and the young women who intend to have a child at some stage in our maternity services. We also owe it to the staff.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue and allowing me to address the House on the matter. I offer my deepest condolences to Mr. Michael Kivlehan, his son, Dior, and their families on the sad and tragic loss of Dhara Kivlehan. I understand the HSE has offered sincere condolences and apologised to both families for the shortcomings in the management and care of Mrs. Kivlehan at Sligo Regional Hospital. While cases of medical misadventure do occur in the health service, it is very important to reassure women and their families that maternal and perinatal health statistics indicate that Ireland continues to be a very safe country in which to give birth. Our safety record and maternal mortality rates compare favourably with those of other developed countries. It is important that we reassure people of these facts. The tragic death of Mrs. Kivlehan took place in 2010. This was before the investigation by HIQA into a maternal death in University Hospital Galway and prior to the CMO's report on perinatal deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise. The actions required to address the recommendations of both reports are being undertaken across health services to improve patient safety and provide a more patient centred model of care. A patient safety culture is now embedded in the HSE's service plan through specific measures, including performance indicators for health care associated infections, medication safety and implementation of early warning scores, which did not obtain at the time. My officials meet the HSE each month on the service plan and patient safety is a standing item on the agenda. The HSE has advised me that improvements in patient safety continue within maternity services at Sligo Regional Hospital. The HSE is also focused on delivering improvements in the way critical care is organised and delivered within the hospital group structures to ensure patients receive the same high quality of care no matter where they are treated. Furthermore, as the Deputies will be aware, we are working on the development of a new maternity strategy for Ireland. Developing the strategy will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided for pregnant women and their babies. This will include both hospital and home care and obstetric-led and maternity led units. The strategy will ensure services comply with best available national and international standards. We want to make sure women are provided with the right care, in the right setting, by the right person, at the right time. While maternal deaths in Ireland are rare, I know that is of no consolation to those families who have suffered such a loss, but I can assure them that we are learning from mistakes of the past, building on that knowledge in the present and endeavouring to ensure they are not repeated in the future. Deputy Kelleher Billy asked about the availability of intensive care beds. I asked for a report on this issue this morning. I also checked how many intensive care unit beds were available this morning as a random test and at least two were available. However, it may be the case that availability presents a difficulty from time to time. Deputy Clare Daly raised a separate matter, relating to Ms Philomena Canning. I understand this case has been in and out of the courts for some time. As I have not been fully briefed on the case, I do not want to comment on it, as I do not know all of the details of it. However, I am aware that the HSE supports and provides cover for a number of community midwives and that no effort is being made to reduce or remove cover for all community midwives. I suggest that if the HSE has decided to withdraw cover in the case of this individual midwife, there may be a reason for it.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	I appreciate the Minister's comment that he has not been fully briefed on the case, but I ask him to look at it because the reason is as I outlined, that she referred somebody to a hospital. This woman has an impeccable record. Sadly, the antics of the HSE have left ten women who are due to give birth imminently without somebody to assist them. I received many e-mails on this issue, but one I received this afternoon came from a woman who was a patient of Ms Philomena Canning and is 32 weeks pregnant. She says women are entering hospitals and leaving in coffins and that women are leaving maternity hospitals carrying their dead children home to be buried. She mentions that nine staff were found to have a case to answer in regard to the death of Savita Halappanavar but not one was suspended, never mind fired. All of them are still practising. She refers to inquests in Sligo, investigations in Portlaoise and says this is what the HSE calls care. She goes on to say: "I would rather birth on the side of the road than enter an Irish hospital as a pregnant woman." The right to bodily integrity and make a decision on when and how one wants to have children is and should be at the heart of a proper maternity care system. I suggest the Minister should review this issue because there has been a deliberate undermining of community midwives. I know that he is only new in the Department, but I ask him to look at the case mentioned in order to help women at the coalface on this issue.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	The Minister referred to the maternity strategy being brought forward. I am aware that there were concerns expressed about a strategy published, or partially published, for the north west, which has now been included in the overall national strategy. Whatever comes about, the key issue is that while we must have certainty in so far as we can, women about to give birth or who will give birth in the future must have confidence in the strategy. There is huge anxiety and concern at times of tragedy such as those mentioned, but by international standards we have a reasonably good maternity service. However, this does not mean that we cannot do more. We should not just leave the report to the memory of the Kivlehan family. It should be acted on and any deficiency raised in the context of the inquest should be acted upon. While we are waiting for the maternity services report, some improvements to enhance the quality and safety of the service could be made. The pressures on maternity services such as the lack of consultants and the pressure on midwives must be examined. Comparisons with international standards show that we are short staffed in these key areas of maternity services.

It may well be that Deputy Clare Daly does not know all of the facts either. When the HSE withdraws cover from somebody, it tends to do so for a reason, not at the whim of an official. Without knowing the reason for the withdrawal, we should confine our comments on the matter. I am probably closer to the Deputy on this issue than she thinks. Pregnancy is not a disease but a physiological condition and there is no reason women with a normal pregnancy should not have their baby delivered at home by a community midwife or in a midwife-led unit. Every pregnancy does not need to be dealt with by an obstetrician and this is the sort of issue the maternity review will consider.  Whether in the case of an obstetrician or a midwife, I put it to the Deputy that the HSE does not withdraw cover lightly or on a whim but for a reason.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	I just asked the Minister to look at the issue.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	On the matters raised by Deputy Billy Kelleher, I inform him of changes that have been made since 2010 when the case occurred. The national early warning score has been introduced to detect deteriorating cases; in the hospital in Sligo there is now a new structured hand-over meeting between medical staff when they move from one shift to another and there is an enhanced and updated admission and discharge policy for ICU. With these changes, there are continuing developments in risk management, structures and processes. While I believe we need more obstetricians - 120 is not enough - according to the OECD's report, Health at a Glance 2013, we have more obstetricians and gynaecologists per head than in Canada and New Zealand. The report also indicates that the ratio of Irish midwives stands above the OECD average and above that in France, Germany and the Netherlands. People can be quite selective when they make comparisons. They pick the countries with which they want to compare. I am picking countries with which I want to compare. As somebody who has worked in eight hospitals, including a maternity hospital, I believe it is important to point out that being short staffed should never be an excuse for medical negligence or misadventure. It takes 30 seconds for a laboratory scientist to ring a ward with a blood result about which there is concern. It takes about one minute to check a blood result. If one misdiagnoses an acute abdomen case, it has nothing to do with time or resources, but is a mistake. We should not allow people to claim that being short staffed is an excuse for medical misadventure or negligence. It should never be accepted as an excuse. If we accept that excuse, it will always be the excuse. Today I heard the suggestion that a patient's mouth was taped with surgical tape because a hospital was short staffed. That is not good enough.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." Significant progress is being made on the programme of political and legislative reform aimed at enhancing openness and transparency. The Registration of Lobbying Bill is an integral part of this programme. The key objective of the Bill is to introduce a register of lobbying to make information available to the public on the identity of those who are communicating with the Government and senior civil and public servants on public policy matters. The exclusive purpose of lobbying by individuals or groups with different interests is to influence decisions taken at political and administrative level. There is, therefore, a strong public interest in knowing "who is lobbying whom about what". The Bill is specifically designed to achieve this goal through the establishment of a web-based registration system of lobbying activity. Vibrant communication and dialogue and close interaction and engagement between the Government and citizens are central to a well functioning democracy and vital to support informed and evidence-based decision making. Interest groups, representative bodies, industry and civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, charities and third party professional lobbyists all provide crucial input and feedback for the political and public administration systems through communication of the views and concerns of the public to legislators and the Government. However, they also clearly seek to influence the policy and decision making process in order to align it with their own organisational or personal goals and objectives. These goals and objectives may reflect a private, commercial or sectoral interest or be represented as a wider public interest or benefit. The aim of the Bill is unequivocally not to restrict the flow of information, opinions, perspectives or proposals feeding into policy making or legislation but rather to bring about significantly greater transparency in that flow. It is appropriate that this activity is open to public scrutiny as part of the desirable checks and balances which help to ensure any attempt to seek to exert undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy formulation and development, political decision making and preparation and implementation of legislation is discouraged. The reports of the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals have highlighted, inter alia, the risk that the legitimacy of the political system could be eroded by the corrosive impact of secrecy and undue influence. The regulation of lobbying is one of a suite of measures the Government is taking to address, through an extensive programme of political and governmental reform, the serious concerns that have emerged in this area in recent times. The value of regulation of lobbying in fostering a culture of integrity is supported by the Organisation for Co-operation and Development, OECD, which states "...a sound framework for transparency in lobbying is crucial to safeguard the public interest, promote a level playing field for business and avoid capture by vocal interest groups". Since communication is the essence of policy making, the introduction of lobbying regulation cannot be allowed to obstruct the information channels to the political system and the public service. The international experience of lobbying regulation reassures us that regulation has not given rise to such unintended harmful effects, nor is there evidence that it has made it more difficult to gain access to key decision makers. It is clear that the introduction of lobbying regulation in Ireland represents a significant change to the existing political culture, replacing a relatively informal set of arrangements with, I hope and believe, a more structured and transparent system. My Department's task was twofold: first, to formulate legislative proposals to meet the objective of registering lobbying activity in a transparent manner and, second, to address the cultural shift required to ensure successful implementation of regulation in this area. From the outset, therefore, my Department sought to engage with as many stakeholders as possible in the change process and tailor the legislation, based on the feedback from that consultation process and best practice and experience overseas, so as to develop a user-friendly and not overly burdensome registration process which meets the transparency objective but minimises compliance costs in terms of both time and resources. In December 2011 advertisements were placed in the national newspapers inviting submissions from interested parties on key issues relating to options for the design, structure and implementation of an effective regulatory system for lobbying. The consultation process was based on the agreed OECD principles for transparency and integrity in lobbying which were the subject of a recommendation by the OECD council in February 2010. The response to that consultation process was positive and approximately 60 organisations and individuals initially submitted views to my Department. A number of these contributors were subsequently invited to meet officials of my Department to discuss specific issues contained in their submissions. In addition, my Department undertook a review of international approaches to the regulation of lobbying. Research was undertaken of lobbying regulation in a number of countries, including Canada, the USA, Australia and several European countries. The regulations in place in the European Union institutions were also analysed, as were the proposals at the time for the introduction of a regulatory regime in the United Kingdom. This work was advised and informed by the work of three international experts on lobbying regulation, Professor Gary Murphy of DCU, Professor Raj Chari of TCD and Dr. John Hogan of DIT, as well as comprehensive analysis and recommendations published by the OECD on lobbying regulation. In preparing my proposals I had regard to five Private Members' Bills published on the topic of regulation of lobbying since 1999. Four of these Bills were introduced by the Labour Party, including one by me, while one was introduced by Fianna Fáil in opposition. The Fine Gael draft lobbying Bill included in its "New Politics" document, published in 2010, was also reviewed as part of the comprehensive analysis of best ideas. In July 2012 my Department published a policy paper entitled, Regulation of Lobbying Policy Proposals. In overall terms, the paper examines what activities should be the subject of regulation through the introduction of a new register. The paper was published to communicate to the public and all interested parties, including Departments and public bodies under their aegis, the main elements of my proposed policy approach to the development of legislation in this area. The paper promoted the view that lobbying was inherent to the democratic process, in and of itself a good thing and played a very positive role in securing a more informed environment for policy making and the development of legislation. I believe there is not a Member of this House, in his or her normal clinic activities, who is not lobbied either by individuals who because of their personal circumstances look for a change in the law or by local or national organisations.  The paper sets out the policy rationale for the regulation of lobbying, as well as an overview of the proposed policy framework and recommended options for further consideration of key features of the legislation, including definitions, disclosure, exemptions, exclusions, the format of the lobbying register, the lobbying registrar, sanctions, a code of conduct, registration fees, a cooling-off period and a review of the legislation.The publication of the policy paper was also intended to allow stakeholders to provide further views on the principal implementation issues arising from the proposed policy approach. Following publication of the policy proposals, a public seminar on the regulation of lobbying in Ireland was hosted by my Department on 5 July 2012 with contributions from me and Ms Lynn Morrison, Integrity Commissioner of Ontario, who was the key speaker at the seminar. This provided an opportunity to have a full and frank debate with a range of interested parties on the emerging issues from the consultation process to the options for improving the regulatory system proposed. Following the public seminar, a further consultation phase on lobbying took place focusing on the issues raised at the seminar. Approximately 30 further responses were received, including from several Departments and public bodies. My proposals have been carefully framed to take account of the issues raised throughout this rather exhaustive consultation process which was important in bringing the Bill to its current stage. Full details of the consultation process, including all of the submissions received and the reports of meetings which took place with stakeholders, are published on my Department's website. I turn to the Bill before us and will briefly go through each Part outlining the content and purpose. Sections 1, 3 and 4 deal with standard preliminary and general matters, including the Title of the Bill and provisions for commencement of the Bill. Section 2 provides for a regular review of the operation, implementation and effectiveness of the legislation. Deputies this this is necessary because we are not going to get it exactly right and we must learn from user experience as the process develops. The first review will be held no later than one year after the commencement day of the Bill. Each subsequent review should be held every five years thereafter. I am interested in hearing Members' views on whether that is too long or short a time line and I have an open mind on the matter. Reports on the findings and recommendations of each review will be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the end of the relevant period. Section 5 provides the definition of "lobbying". It establishes that lobbying activity is carried out by persons in the course of their business in return for payment by a client - obvious paid lobbyists; an employer or his or her employee on behalf of the employer; any person on matters of planning or rezoning of land. It defines the communications which constitute lobbying and those that are excluded. It also determines that normal citizen interaction with public representatives in a private and non-commercial capacity or communications by employers with ten employees or fewer acting on behalf of that employer will not be included in the register unless the communication is in respect of land rezoning or development. Planning matters relating to an individual's private residence will also be exempt. This section also sets out other exemptions from the regulatory requirements set out in the Bill. Such exemptions include those relating to international relations, factual information sought by a public body or other information sought and published by a public body and matters posing a threat to the safety of persons or the security of the State. It also exempts communications between public officials acting in an official capacity. Communications between members of a group established by a Minister or a public body and including persons from outside the public service are also exempt, subject to a requirement to comply with a transparency code. Section 6 sets out the meaning of "designated public official". This term includes Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers, Deputies, Senators, members of local authorities and Irish MEPs. I intend that, on commencement, the Bill will apply to communications with officials at Secretary General and assistant secretary level in the Civil Service and equivalent levels in local authorities. It is my intention to extend the Bill on a phased basis and prescribe further grades within the Civil Service and other areas of the public service as designated public officials in the light of experience with implementation. Again, I am interested in hearing the views of Members opposite in that regard. The Bill requires public bodies to maintain a list of designated officials with up-to-date details on their websites.  Section 7 defines certain terms used in the Bill.  Part 2 of the Bill contains sections 8 to 15, inclusive, and details how the system of registration of lobbying communications will operate. Section 8 provides that a lobbyist must be registered before carrying on lobbying activities, unless it is that person's first time to lobby. In that case, the registration and the return must be completed before the next return date.  Section 9 provides that the commission will establish a register of lobbyists. The Standards in Public Office Commission will be the registrar.  Section 10 provides that the information to be supplied when registering or in a return will be available on the register. It provides for the commission to decide not to publish certain personal information in order to prevent misuse or to protect the person's right to privacy, for example, private email addresses. It also sets out the role of the commission should it deem that information given is inaccurate, out of date or misleading. Section 11 provides for the registration details to be included in the register and confirmation that the details entered on the register are correct. It also allows for registrants to have their registration marked as ceased.  Section 12 provides for returns to be filed. It requires three returns per year. Anyone engaged in lobbying, in accordance with the definitions used in the Bill, must file a return for each of the mandatory return dates. It allows for a nil return to be submitted also.  Section 13 provides that the commission may require clarification or further information which must be returned within 21 days of the date of the notice. Where a reply is not received within 21 days, the inaccurate registration or return will be removed from the register for non-compliance and a notice of the removal will be issued. The registration or return will be considered as not having been made. In certain circumstances the commission may also immediately remove the information from the register. Section 14 provides for delayed publication where the registrant believes the registration or the return relating to the lobbying activity would be expected to have a serious adverse effect on the financial interests of the State, the national economy or business interests generally or the business interests of any description of persons or it establishes that the commission on receipt of the application will consult the relevant Ministers, where appropriate, before a decision is made on such matters. Delayed publication may also be sought where immediate publication would be expected to cause a material financial loss to the person to whom the information relates or prejudice seriously the competitive position of that person in the conduct of the person's occupation, profession or business or the outcome of any contractual or other negotiations being conducted by that person. In both cases, the commission would be required to consider whether the public interest would, on balance, be better served by refusing to grant than by granting the application. The commission may also decide to publish summary information only. All of this is an empowering provision to be exercised at the complete discretion of the registrar.  Section 15 is a technical provision and establishes that any document which the commission certified as a copy of an entry on the register is deemed to be a true copy. This is just normal legal cover.  Part 3 of the Bill contains sections 16 and 17 and deals with the code of conduct for lobbyists and guidance to be provided by the commission. Section 16 allows for a statutory code of conduct to be created for lobbyists by the commission. In developing a code the commission must consult interested organisations or individuals. Section 17 allows the commission to issue guidance, particularly with a view to promoting understanding of the Bill. This is a new provision and from all the discussions I have had with interested groups, I know that there is concern and fear about how it will impact on normal organisations such as the IFA and trade unions in carrying out their normal affairs. It will take a bedding-in process to explain it in some detail. Part 4 contains sections 18 to 21, inclusive, and deals with enforcement matters. Section 18 defines the contraventions relevant to the Bill. Section 19 provides the commission with the power to authorise an investigation to be carried out. The commission can appoint authorised officers to carry out an investigation on its behalf. While conducting an investigation, an authorised officer can request any information or copies of documentation deemed appropriate to the investigation and has the power to enter the premises to seek copies of documents, subject to the consent of the occupier or pursuant to a warrant. Any information in the authorised officer's possession will remain confidential, unless the Bill requires it to be public. Section 20 provides for prosecution for serious offences under the Bill and the imposition of penalties for these offences. Section 21 establishes that the commission may serve fixed payment notices where an offence has been committed under section 20(1) in regard to the late filing of returns. A fixed payment notice will state the amount, namely, €200, and the payment method and date. Where payment is made within the timeframe, court proceedings will not be initiated. Part 5 contains sections 22 to 26, inclusive, and covers miscellaneous and supplementary issues. Section 22 provides for certain designated public officials, notably Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and, on commencement of the Bill, Secretaries General and assistant secretaries in the Civil Service and equivalent grades in local authorities, to apply to the commission for approval to carry out lobbying activities in an area that might cause a conflict of interest as a result of their former roles in public employment within one year of ceasing to be designated public officials. The model proposed focuses on the particular activities likely to present a conflict of interest, rather than imposing a blanket ban on the take-up of employment. This approach allows the commission to permit, for example, the take-up of employment but to impose conditions or refuse to give consent. This will be an issue we can discuss in some detail. We have to strike a balance between not debarring people from exercising their constitutional right to work, while at the same time ensuring there is no improper use of information gleaned or garnered while holding a public position when one has moved out of that position.  Section 23 provides for appeals of decisions made by the commission. It establishes that the Minister can appoint a panel of independent appeals officers. Appeals may be made in regard to decisions made under section 10(5) relating to inaccurate or misleading information, under section 14 relating to delayed publication or under section 22 relating to post-term employment applications.  Section 24 establishes that a decision of the appeals officer may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law. This appeal must be brought within 21 days of the notice of the decision. The decision of the High Court is final.  Section 25 provides for an annual report to be compiled by the commission. It sets out the type of information to be reported on and provides for the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within six months of the end of the relevant period. Section 26 makes amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 to provide, as appropriate, for changes to the functions of the commission regarding its new role as lobbying registrar. The consultation process has demonstrated the complexity of the issues involved and the required culture change arising in the introduction of regulation in this area for the first time. I assure the House that the correct balance will be achieved between the need for maximum transparency in public policy making and the need to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens on those sectors which interact, as a matter of course and routine and as is proper and appropriate, with government. The Bill, therefore, proposes reviewing the legislation 12 months after its commencement in the light of our experience with its implementation. I would welcome the views of Members now and in more detail when we get into the meat of the Bill on Committee Stage on any additional provision which they believe would strengthen the Bill or help to ensure it meets its core objective of casting greater light on public policy making. I will genuinely approach our discussions with an open mind. I anticipate that I will have a number of technical amendments to bring forward on Committee Stage. In addition, I intend to propose an amendment to section 5 which will have the effect of ensuring relevant communication by representative bodies and bodies established to further particular issues will come within the definition of lobbying, regardless of the number of employees in the bodies. The amendment will not change the broad policy approach adopted in section 5. The intention is that the Bill will be enacted during this session. I hope it can be passed safely by both Houses in that timeline. A period of time will then be required prior to commencement of the legislation to enable the development of the IT and information systems which will support the registration process. My Department is working closely with the Standards in Public Office Commission on these issues. We are also discussing resource issues. It is intended to establish an advisory group shortly, comprising relevant experts and key stakeholders who will be in a position to provide information and guidance to assist in the smooth implementation of the Bill once enacted. Of course, the timeframe for the regulatory provisions of the Bill to be brought into operation will depend, in the first instance, on the time it takes for both Houses to pass the Bill. All going according to plan, however, I anticipate commencement of the Bill by the summer of 2015. I will be happy to expand on any of the provisions included in the Bill during the course of the debate, if Deputies wish to raise particular issues, if there are new proposals or anybody has examined international best practice and can add to the Bill. I will approach the debate with an open mind. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies and hope the House will support the passage of the Bill, secure its speedy passage on Second Stage, have a detailed debate on Committee Stage to meet the timeline I have set out for having the Bill as the law of the land, with all support necessary through the Standards in Public Office Commission, by the middle of next year.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	We are discussing the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014, the timing of which is most relevant and interesting. Before I debate the specifics of this important legislation, we need to examine the background. Essentially, the citizens of Ireland want to know who has the inside track. Many believe a small group of people have the inside track and can get their point of view across and have it accepted by the Government or other public bodies, as the case may be, and that the majority are excluded from this track.  When I read the Bill, I asked myself a simple question: would the Bill, if enacted in its current form, show who had lobbied the Taoiseach on the appointment to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art? If the Bill leads to that question being anwered, it is a good one. That will be the acid test. I would like to know where in the Bill these issues are addressed.  The Minister has had to rush and brought a memo to the Cabinet today on appointments to public bodies. That is all well and good and cuts across the area of who lobbies Ministers and Taoisigh on board appointments. However, the issue of board appointments is not discrete; it has a wider impact across other issues. We are here to discuss the issue of lobbying the Government, Ministers and those in decision making capacities. The Minister may be able to explain at the end of the Second Stage debate or on Committee Stage where in the Bill we can find a clear answer to the question as to which section refers to the lobbying of the Taoiseach or a Minister on an appointment to a State board.I refer to that issue because it is a current example of what is going on and it is not just the Taoiseach but the Minister of the Taoiseach's own party. The Taoiseach was forced to admit today that the Minister had been given CVs by officials of her own party.  This leads to another important distinction which we might have to include in the legislation. I refer to the Jesuitical distinction the Taoiseach made a couple of hours ago in the Chamber when he distinguished between his role as Taoiseach and his role as leader of the Fine Gael Party. It was as if to say, "They are two separate issues." Technically, they are, but he is the one person. It is not good enough to say that when he was looking at the CVs of the various people nominated in Fine Gael for their suitability for the Seanad, he interviewed the particular man in question in his capacity as leader of Fine Gael. Yes, he has that role, but when the role as a leader of a political party impacts on public bodies, the distinction is no longer valid. I do not mind if the Taoiseach is out canvassing in Tallaght tonight and dealing with issues as leader of Fine Gael from a Fine Gael perspective. He may be asked about issues relating to Government policy, but he cannot take decisions as leader of Fine Gael that affect Government actions. There must be a distinction. The distinction the Taoiseach drew this afternoon is capable of driving a coach and four through this legislation. It will allow him to say, "In my capacity as Taoiseach, I never met that person." The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht can say, "I never met that person." The Minister for Finance can say, "In my capacity as Minister for Finance, neither I nor my officials met that person. It so happens as a member of Fine Gael, I met him." The same applies to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as a member of the Labour Party. There is a lacuna that must be closed in some way because the public will not accept that loophole in the legislation when passed. I accept that the roles are distinct, but where they collide, there must be legislation to cover the registration of lobbying. The legislation will mean nothing to the public if we can have a repeat of what happened in the last fortnight in six or 12 months time. The issue must be addressed and the gap must be closed. Only a few short hours ago going into the Cabinet meeting, the Minister opposite, Deputy Brendan Howlin, was recorded as saying he would vote for Mr. John McNulty. He said he had a problem in getting legislation through the Seanad and that it was important that he vote as a Government member for Mr. McNulty to assist in getting legislation through in the next 18 months. Does the Minister stand by this? Mr. McNulty who has shown a degree of integrity we did not see from the Taoiseach or the Minister does not have a legal mechanism to take his name off the ballot paper. There could be a case for cancelling the election if people were serious about it. Perhaps, it cannot happen in a democracy once an election is taking place. I remember that during the local elections a Fine Gael councillor, unfortunately, died the day before or on the morning of polling and the election was held over for three weeks. There must be some exceptional provision to allow an election to be held over. It will make a mockery of integrity and honesty if members of the Government parties go ahead and vote Mr. McNulty into the Seanad on 10 October, the weekend before the budget. He has said, "Do not vote for me," but the Minister has said he is voting for him. The Minister might clarify whether he will comply with Mr. McNulty's request. It will make a joke of every member of the Government if they continue to say they still think Mr. McNulty is the most suitable person on the ballot paper and that they have no option but to vote for him. If he takes his seat in the Seanad, it will make a mockery of the whole process, which brings me back to my first question. Who lobbied the Taoiseach and will the legislation cover that scenario? It is a very important question. I never like to get personal, but there is some family connection to canvassers of the person involved or something like that. The legislation excludes social contacts. There is significant scope to get around the legsislation, which is my difficulty. Fianna Fáil produced a Bill in January 2012, as the Minister did previously. It has been around a while and there is no getting away from it. Our problem with the timing of the legislation - I have a problem with the content also, but we will talk about how it can be improved - is that it was promised in the programme for Government in 2011. We gave the Government 12 months and in early 2012 published our own Bill.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	To test the promise made, we brought forward the legislation which, it goes without saying, the Minister has not taken up. We brought the Bill forward because at that stage the Government was talking about the sale of State assets. It has since privatised the national lottery licence and parts of Bord Gáis and its customer base and meters, which has a resonance for the other subsidiary of Bord Gáis in relation to Irish Water. There is nothing except a Government majority preventing that from happening at a later date. The Government has set up NewERA and Irish Water and none of us knows who lobbied who during these processes. That is why we wanted the legislation to be brought forward before all that was done. The financial decision on setting up Irish Water will be one of the larger ones the Government will have taken in terms of new legislation, new State bodies and the sale of various State assets, as I have mentioned, yet all of that was neatly got out of the way before this legislation came to pass. What most concerns me about the legislation is the mammoth number of omissions. The first thing that needs to be included in the legislation is consultants employed to carry out work on behalf of public bodies. I go back to the national lottery licence. The Minister rightly pointed out that he was not involved and that consultants were employed to deal with it. He was hands off. Believe it or not, consultants are human too, although some people might not think so. People could have lobbied these consultants on the sale of State assets. They might lobby any consultant brought in to modernise any Department or State body. Unless the consultants who are being paid by the public body are brought under this legislation, it will be woefully inadequate. There must be a mechanism for to do this. The Government can outsource a decision to a consultancy firm and people can lobby the consultants. The result can be the one desired by the lobbyists and the Government can state, "But nobody lobbied us." That is not good enough and we must deal with the issue. We must also consider, as the Minister suggests in the last paragraph of his speech, the provision regarding employers with fewer than ten employees. I come at this from a couple of points of view and most of what I say will work its way into amendments which the Minister will receive. We will go back over my script and the Minister's officials will have time to consider from where I am coming. The ten employee provision appears, on the face of it, to be fine to avoid tormenting small companies in trying to lobby for something simple. However, many businesses are run through shelf companies. Some of the largest construction contracts handed out through public procurement processes go to developers with few or no employees. We are tired of talking about main contractors who pass jobs on to subcontractors who pass them on again. The main contractor for the job may be a shelf company taken on for a specific project worth tens of millions of euro. While the intention in the ten employee provision is good, we must capture more people than that number. Many of the largest companies in the country have shelf companies within their organisational structures. One could have a holding company in which all decisions are made and which has no employees. It may just be a chairman, the secretary and a board with no staff. We must have a mechanism to catch all of these.  The Minister referred to the issue of the representative bodies. How many times have I been lobbied by RECI or electrical or security contractors with only two or three employees? However, they are big organisations when they get going. One might have to consider turnover, as well as issues such as representative bodies in terms of the group of which a company is part. I acknowledge that this is getting complicated, whether it be €5 million or €10 million, but if there are companies in the market for large contracts, there must be a mechanism to capture them. The requirement in respect of having ten employees is too narrow when it comes to business transactions. An example would be companies liable to be audited. They must have a certain turnover and be of a certain size. I am not saying the exact figure that should apply, but that size is closer to the scale of a company about which Revenue will want to know. I am trying to be helpful by making some suggestions other than about the employees, but I understand the Minister's position. The Minister might clarify where all this legislation will fit in under the freedom of information legislation. I presume the Standards in Public Office, SIPO, is subject to the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act but there are references in the report to the effect that it can issue summaries of reports etc. There is no point in inserting that in the legislation if the full report is capable of being got under FOI-----

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	It is not a bone of contention but we might clarify that. I have an open mind on one of the contentious issues in this legislation. I do not have a fixed view, although some people have fixed views on this issue. The Minister nailed his colours to the mast in the programme for Government about the two year cooling off period. The legislation refers to one year. I know some people believe strongly the period should be two or three years, or that the person should never work in the area again. Some people will always go to the extreme and if the Minister is introducing such measures for somebody who leaves a public body, the issue of compensating that person who cannot work again in an area in which they have expertise must be examined. The popular view is that the period should be two years, the longer the better, that we are all pariahs and we should not have interaction between the public and private sectors. I take the opposite view. Part of what is wrong with Ireland is that there is an undue suspicion between the public and the private sectors. The more regulated interaction, the better. More interaction is better for both the public and the private sector but I accept that we must regulate it. I am not just sure whether the legislation should provide for a period of one or two years. I will give an example, and the Minister might respond that it is good for the company involved. A senior official in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who was excellent in terms of the dairy or the beef industry retires at whatever age he is entitled to retire. It could be beneficial for the country for that person to be employed by one of our major international co-operatives to help our food exports. Some might say he should go home and watch DVDs or play golf for two years and that he should not be allowed take up a position that could help the industry, employment and exports. I believe we must reconcile that issue. I may be going a little too far but I can see a situation where a retired public servant, and we are talking about different grades of people, through the talents and knowledge he or she has built up, being used in the international sphere for the good of the country, and he would be getting paid for it - there is no argument about that. I would be concerned that we would take the simple line that he could not do that. It is complicated, and conflict of interest issues arise, but it is an issue we have to tease out. I do not subscribe to the strict demarcation line between the public and the private sectors. Exchange of staff between the public and private sectors can be good for all concerned. The question I have to ask is who lobbied for that change since the programme for Government was agreed.

I want the best result for Ireland, once it is properly regulated. I move on to the areas that have been excluded, and I will start with the semi-State monopolies. We have had this argument previously. Bus Éireann is in competition with other Irish operators but I look at the monopoly. Irish Rail is a monopoly and Irish Water is a monopoly. In some aspects of the market An Post is a monopoly.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	No. I refer to other public bodies that I believe should come under this legislation. EirGrid should come under it because it has a massive impact on people's lives. A director of Sustainable Energy Ireland is a director of one of the companies promoting the big wind farm projects - I refer to Brendan Halligan, a former colleague of the Minister. That has come up time and again, and I have heard the Minister's Oireachtas colleagues criticising that apparent conflict of interest between a person who is a director of Sustainable Energy Ireland and also a director of one of the companies promoting wind farms. EirGrid and such organisations that deal with this area should be included. In terms of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, a definition of what is and is not covered should be included. I refer also to the Irish Aviation Authority, which I accept is a niche area. I came to mention the Minister's colleague in Clare who was put onto that board. We have had a good bit of that discussion in the past few days. I mention the Private Security Authority and Tourism Ireland also. Many hotel groups, bed and breakfast establishments and a wide variety of people in the tourism industry want to lobby Tourism Ireland for funding and projects that will be beneficial to them. Such people have a very big impact. Waterways Ireland is another one. I read in one of the briefing notes here in the Oireachtas that what is excluded is the implementation of public policy. I know it must stop somewhere. The Minister said that some of the companies I mentioned did not make public policy but those that implement public policy, such as the organisations I mentioned including Tourism Ireland or EirGrid, must be covered under this legislation. There is a gap in that regard. Sometimes those organisations can have far more practical power and influence in terms of people's daily lives and the direction in which the country is going than the officials in the Department who drafted the legislation that set them up. Principal officers and assistant principal officers have to be included in the legislation. Principal officers are on higher salaries than Oireachtas Members and the salary grade-----

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	I am told principal officers and assistant principal officers regularly accompany Ministers to the Dáil and have a key interaction with what is going on, and they should be included also. There is a suggestion that the private secretaries to Ministers should be included also because they can have a key role in setting up meetings, encouraging meetings to take place or discouraging meetings. I was never a Minister. I do not know how strong a private secretary can be but I am sure some private secretaries can get their Minister to meet an individual if they believe it would be worthwhile to his or her Department. There is a case to be made in that regard. I refer to all the people who are lobbyists but who do not have to list their social contacts. The Minister excluded the Frank Flannerys of this world from the legislation. I come back to my opening sentence about the inside track. The people want to be assured there is not an inside track for the 1% of people concerned as opposed to the other 99%. He had an inside track. I will not demonise the man but the case was publicised. I mention him because the Minister's former ministerial colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, said about him earlier this year that he was always around the corridors and that he could lobby in a non-lobby kind of way. He would chat to one and tell one what he wanted done. He would say he was not there to lobby one but one would get the point he was making. The former Minister said Frank Flannery was capable of lobbying in a non-lobbying kind of way. It is a lovely phrase. It is probably an Irish way of putting it but everyone understood that. It might not be the Queen's English but Irish people understood what that meant. We have to deal with that. In a way, because of what is omitted, the legislation is a bit of a fig leaf because it is narrow. I have listed the areas I want included, and the people will see that. They want high standards and ethics in politics. I have been canvassing in the by-election in recent days and people are shocked. They thought we had a change in Irish society but they said that when it comes to this issue this crowd are worse than us.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	I never thought we were that bad but the Minister gets the point I am making. What we have seen in the past week has shattered some people's confidence. Some people had a low opinion of politics to start with. Their confidence was not shattered but those people who had a decent interpretation of ethics in politics felt let down. We need a proper and full registration of lobbying Bill, not what is before the House. A great deal needs to be included in this legislation and if the Minister accepts our amendments, we will have good legislation that will be fit for purpose. I seek clarification on a number of points.If there is lobbying on broader issues then this should be included. The Minister might clarify where the other social partners fit in. He made a reference to the IFA, IBEC, charities, voluntary groups, sporting organisations and organisations helping the homeless. Groups are set up around the country and might have to hire a legal person if they are opposing a wind farm or organising a campaign to save the local post office. People are afraid they could be trapped by this legislation. Some of the organisations have well over ten paid staff.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	I am trying to understand the consistency of the view of Deputy Sean Fleming. Should a former politician or a former party official be able to lobby on the issue of wind farms?
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	352	It is complicated and we will get into it in more detail. Some of the organisations, like the IFA or the GAA, have many paid officials. More often than not we meet the local voluntary chairman who is here on behalf of the person who sent him with a very good briefing note. The latter was from an organisation with more than ten people. That can happen in sporting organisations. I have covered various aspects of the Bill. I refer to some of the specifics. I am dealing with section 5(k). I have an issue in respect of communication between public servants. The story goes that Ryanair wanted to put an airport at Baldonnel and the civil servants who would be living under the flight path on the south side of the city conspired and decided it was not a good idea. Public servants dealing with organisations other than their own should be brought into this. The organisation has a function in its own right and these matters may not always be in the public interest. I refer to commercial bodies, semi-State bodies and some of the regulators I mentioned. The Minister has omitted the regulators from this legislation. The energy regulator, the National Transport Authority, the health insurance regulator and perhaps the Financial Regulator must be brought in under the legislation. They are key people in implementing Government policy. Section 5(l) refers to semi-State companies. It is okay if they are dealing with the Minister in the ordinary course of business, such as day-to-day activity or monthly or annual reporting. When there is a bigger issue to be dealt with, they should not be exempt from the legislation. Section 5(7)(c) refers to relevant matters and the authorisation involving public funds. Is it voted funds? The matter has been raised in this House before. Are moneys that go to section 38 or section 39 organisations public funds? It has come out of the public purse and has passed onto a private body. Some of the organisations are mammoth and have a major influence on the delivery of key health services. We must tease out this matter. Section 14 deals with delayed publication. I can understand that there might be a reason for it but an annual report should refer to where items are subject to delayed publications. Details do not need to be given but people should know whether there are matters of concern. Local authorities must be addressed. The Minister has included local authority members for planning and zoning issues. What underlines this legislation is that people must be paid to do the lobbying. There is crossover between people in a company and volunteers working for the same company who are a front for the same organisation but are not being paid. That must be addressed. I refer to factual information that has been requested. Statistics are factual information but in every organisation there are lies, damn lies and statistics. The same factual information can be presented in different ways depending on the point of view one is trying to get across. We must specify what factual information means because it normally means that people draw conclusions when looking at a graph. With regard to grassroots lobbying, the Minister mentioned that the key aspect is the reference to managing or directing the making of relevant communications. A paid organisation can be directing the relevant communications even if the people involved are not doing it themselves. This deals with representative groups and associations. With regard to the regulatory impact statement, I noted that we made provision in the Estimate of €350,000 for SIPO to get ahead with this. The Minister might tell us where we are now in that regard because the legislation will not be enacted before Christmas. Will that need to come back to the Department and be given to SIPO in next year's Estimate? The principle of the legislation is welcome but my main concern is the level of admissions. Much of what is in there, in respect of the role of trade unions and investigations, is good. People cannot just walk in with a warrant from a District Court. I will not deal with what I have not referred to because those elements are okay. They are necessary and I have no argument with the drafting. Fianna Fáil will table a number of amendments to broaden the scope of the legislation rather than its detail. I look forward to discussing it in detail on Committee Stage.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	I welcome the introduction of the legislation, which has been a long time coming. The legislation comes on the back of decades of political corruption and cronyism. Members in the Dáil and beyond are familiar with the corruption scandals of the 1990s to 2000s that exposed corrupt practices. In summary, the legislation is designed to rebuild trust in the political system. It is welcome and necessary. It is unfortunate that, at a time when we discuss this landmark legislation, it is against a backdrop of some of the most outrageous displays of stroke politics. As recently as today in the Dáil Chamber, we heard the Taoiseach give an incoherent and garbled account of communication and decision-making between his political party, his decisions as leader of Fine Gael, and his communication with a fellow member of Cabinet, Deputy Heather Humphreys. The Taoiseach has acknowledged responsibility for some wrongdoing but he has, as yet, fallen short of identifying the sequence of events and what he is apologising for. In discussing the legislation, it is not a platform for us to focus on the issue but it is important that in dealing with legislation such as this, we understand the depth of the malaise and the lack of public confidence in individual politicians or political parties but also in the political process and system. It is a serious state of affairs and we must be sure the legislation goes substantially along the way to address some of the issues. I am glad there is a review provision after 12 months. I am concerned about the five-year period thereafter. It is rather long and perhaps we will revisit this aspect on Committee Stage. I may suggest a three-year period but we can debate the matter. I share the concerns raised in respect of designated persons. There is a difference between an outside organisation or group lobbying a public official and the internal communications of public officials.I accept that these are qualitatively different things. None the less, if this legislation fails to capture the lobbying that does happen between public officials of one sort or another, be they of high rank in the Civil Service or at ministerial rank, we leave a very big and gaping hole in the legislation. The events of the past week or more involving the Taoiseach's interaction with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the matter of the appointment to the board of IMMA clearly reflect the need for transparency and for a light to be shone on those interactions. I do not propose that this would intrude on matters of Cabinet confidentiality but the Minister must consider and have an open mind on Committee Stage. I do not believe that the Minister, no more than I, wishes to see, much less preside over, a situation where lobbying can occur in that manner and can have such a negative consequence in terms of public confidence and public perception. I am interested to see the meaning of this transparency code referred to in section 5 and what it might look like. I know it is not proposed to incorporate the transparency code within the primary legislation but I suggest that we could have a very useful and, I hope, fruitful conversation on Committee Stage on that concept and what form and shape it might take. This time of the year is very busy for lobbyists. The budget will be announced in a fortnight and Oireachtas Members have spent a lot of time in recent weeks attending briefings on the budget and considering budgetary submissions from various organisations, companies and charities. Given the very great and often crippling effect that budgetary decisions can have on individuals and families, it is very important that all interest groups have equal access to policy-makers. We need to redress the imbalance between those organisations that have the resources to fund slick public relations campaigns and those that do not enjoy such a level of resources. We must ensure, inasmuch as is possible, that equal access is afforded to groups that are broadly representative of society and not just of large commercial interests. We must make space for and acknowledge smaller community group lobbies and charities. The Minister referred to the consultation process. I welcome that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform undertook this process with interested parties as part of the drafting process. It was very important that we had access to a range of opinion and expertise on the subjects of lobbying and advocacy. I acknowledge the work carried out within this process by organisations, individuals and community groups who took part in that consultation process and by the Department and its officials. It is disappointing that we have had to wait so long for the Bill to reach Second Stage. It perhaps reflects that this matter was low on the list of priorities for political reform for the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government. The Minister will recall that Fine Gael promised to implement sweeping political reform under the now fabled banner of the democratic revolution. This week has shown us that it is business as usual in so far as stroke politics and jobs for the boys are concerned. It is sobering to see how little has changed since the arrival of the new Government and the scant regard that Fine Gael and, it seems, the Labour Party, have in real terms for the project of political reform. No matter how many political scandals are exposed and investigated in this State, lessons are not learned and the cycle continues. On a note of optimism, the debate, consideration and passage of this legislation, as amended, will mark something of a sea change in that attitude within what I will call the political class. The intention of regulating lobbyists is to level the playing field in order that all stakeholders have equal access to decision-makers in matters of policy-making or in the drafting of legislation. The worst outcome for this legislation would be that groups would be excluded from its remit. It is important that regulation does not present any barriers to small groups or to citizens accessing representatives or policy-makers. I draw the Minister's attention to section 5 and the fact registered charities are not mentioned. The Minister will be aware that charities are entitled to tax exemption if registered with the Revenue Commissioners. Under Revenue guidelines, an organisation that engages in lobbying cannot be registered as a charity. I hope that at the more interactive forum of Committee Stage we can tease out this matter and have a discussion about lobbying and advocacy and the role of charity groups and protections for such groups within that system. We cannot leave a situation where charities engaging in advocacy might lose their status as registered charities due to any lack of clarity in the Bill. I am pleased to note that the register proposed is to be made available online, public and free of charge. This is the correct course of action. I am also pleased that a range of information to do with various types of lobbying will also be available in the online register. It is very important that the most comprehensive information possible is available to the public. This might entail amendments to the Freedom of Information Act if meetings and other activities which are currently available for public scrutiny are to be included in the register. We will need a discussion on and some clarification of this part of the legislation. I am pleased to note specific protection for normal citizens in their interactions with public representatives in the matters of their private affairs has been included in the list of exemptions. There are a few questionable inclusions in this section. While I appreciate the positive sentiments behind the exclusion of communications by employers with ten or fewer employees, it might be prudent to redefine this subsection to include the annual turnover of companies. The Minister might be open to a discussion and an amendment along these lines.

I will be using 15 of the allotted 40 minutes and the remainder will be shared equally among the other three Deputies. "Imagine if we saw the potential of refugees not the imagined risk. The opportunity not the fabricated crisis. Compassion not fear. Imagine." This is a quote from the founder and CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Australia. It is an observation with which it is important to begin this debate and for everyone to keep in mind in the context of the motion before the House. The number of refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people worldwide has for the first time in the post-Second World War era exceeded 50 million, which truly is astonishing. When I see this figure it brings to mind the 4,300 plus asylum seekers - over one third of whom are children - in Ireland who are living, if one can call it that, in inhuman conditions not fit for the 21st century in the 34 direct provision accommodation centres throughout the country. This system must end. For 14 years people from these centres have come to me desperate for assistance. At this stage, some of them have been living in direct provision for over ten years. I know from their experience, and from mine in representing them, that these centres are not fit for purpose and they effectively operate as open prisons. In particular, I am concerned about the protection of children in these centres. Many of the children in question were born into this system and know no better life. While there has been much talk recently on reforming the system, the Government has done little in respect of the matter. The direct provision working group which is being established will not result in the reform that is required because it is being asked how the current system might be improved when what is actually needed is an alternative. Concerns raised about direct provision since 2001 include the lack of any legal basis for the system of direct provision; and reports of poor food quality, infestations, cramped living conditions and individuals institutionalised in the system for several years. Reports relating to prostitution and safety issues in respect of children are nothing new for anyone who has worked in this area, despite the fact that these issues only received media attention quite recently. As a result of the fact that there is a limited choice of food, movement and shared living space, curfews and restrictions on visitors to the centres, it is claimed - and rightly so - that the system breaches the right to private and family life under Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights. In fact, some of the asylum seekers with whom I have worked are unable to attend the debate tonight and tomorrow night because they cannot break their curfews. Despite the recent media attention this issue has been receiving - it is about time too - I have been wanting to raise it during my allotted Private Members' time for almost a year. When it began to receive increased attention during the summer and when it seemed clear announcements were pending, I briefly considered whether there was any point in proceeding with tabling this motion if we were on the precipice of great change. Then, earlier in the summer, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, ruled out any consideration of the question of extending the right to work for asylum seekers. Shortly thereafter, the establishment of the working group was announced. Subsequently, the Minister has continued to make reserved comments. Everyone here who has an interest in the direct provision system can indicate what needs to be done because the experts have been informing us about the matter for quite some time. While I am sure there are good intentions on the part of the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, this is just another delaying tactic on the part of Fine Gael that will result in a much diluted version of what must to be done. That is just not acceptable. Most Members will agree that the current system just will not do. I am glad the matters in this regard have moved forward, even though there is still an undercurrent of discrimination against asylum seekers that is being fed by a flow of misinformation. However, the motion is not about fixing the wrongs in the direct provision system. Rather, it relates to constructing an alternative and it is in this light that I want to progress the debate. The motion calls on the Government to abolish the direct provision system and introduce specialised reception centres operating as one-stop-shops for newly arrived protection applicants providing access to the necessary services for the identification and assessment of needs; provide appropriate accommodation which respects family life in a system that embodies the best interests of the child as well as identifying and properly supporting individuals with special needs and vulnerabilities; ensure the availability of early legal advice and independent complaints and inspection mechanisms; provide for the transfer to independent living within six months if a decision on a person's status has not been reached by then; introduce a strategy for implementation of the new system with a clearly defined timeframe to adapt to a reformed system of accommodation for asylum seekers; lift the prohibition on employment to allow residents of direct provision centres to actively participate in society, giving them a sense of worth and purpose in their daily lives, which is a basic need of every human being; and introduce a mechanism that allows asylum seekers that have already begun the process of applying for asylum in Ireland and who are, therefore, unable to avail of the single procedure to be fast-tracked to ensure no further unnecessary delays ensue. This issue goes beyond party politics, it is a human rights issue. I, therefore, urge all parties and Independents to accept the motion. In its observations published last July, the UN Human Rights Committee rightly put Ireland to shame regarding its direct provision system when it expressed its concern "at the lack of a single application procedure for the consideration of all grounds of international protection, leading to delays in the processing of asylum claims and prolonged accommodation of asylum seekers in direct provision centres which is not conducive to family life". The committee recommended that Ireland "take appropriate legislative and policy measures to establish a single application procedure with a right of appeal to an independent appeals body without further delay" and that the Government should ensure that "the duration of stay in direct provision centres is as short as possible and introduce an accessible and independent complaints procedure in direct provision centres". The Government appears to believe that the introduction of the single application procedure for protection will solve everything. However, the proposed legislation will have no impact on the thousands of asylum seekers who have been left waiting years for decisions on their status. The number in this regard continues to grow but we have not yet even been presented with the draft heads of the proposed protection Bill. Regardless of this, there should be respect for basic human rights in any centres which accommodate asylum seekers, however short their stay. By only fixing some of the problem, all the Government is doing is papering over the cracks. Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness put it aptly when she warned that a future Irish Government will be obliged to issue a State apology to and compensate former direct provision residents, particularly children. Last summer we learned that social services have been alerted to over 1,500 cases involving young asylum seekers. The issues investigated by child protection staff in respect of these cases include inappropriate sexualised behaviour among children, the inability of parents to cope, young people not being supervised and mental health problems. In addition, the figure to which I refer indicates that the volume of reported concerns over children living in direct provision accommodation are between three and four times the rate for young people who live in the general community. The 2012 report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, highlighted the real risk of child abuse in direct provision accommodation arising from shared sleeping arrangements whereby single parent families are required to share with strangers and teenagers are obliged to share with parents and siblings of the opposite sex. The "E" grade given by the Children's Rights Alliance in its Report Card 2013 in respect of the right to equality and non-discrimination exemplifies how asylum seeking children are being treated. Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, requires states to ensure that children are not discriminated against, including in the context of the status of their parents, while Article 7 stipulates that a child shall have a right to a nationality. It has been affirmed that the enjoyment of rights stipulated in the UNCRC is not limited to children who are citizens of a state party and must, if not explicitly stated otherwise, also be available to all children - including asylum-seeking children - irrespective of their nationality, immigration status or statelessness. The UNCRC also calls on states to ensure that all young children are guaranteed access to appropriate and effective services - including programmes of health, care and education - specifically designed to promote their well-being and that particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of young children and those who are at risk of discrimination. The latter category includes asylum-seeking children. We all know that we are failing miserably in the protection of such children. This is also widely known elsewhere. Last year authorities in the North sought to return a Sudanese asylum seeker and her three children to the Republic, where they initially sought asylum. However, the High Court in the North prevented the move on the basis that returning the family to direct provision was not in the best interests of the children. The presiding judge, Mr. Justice J. Stevens found that "the well-being both emotionally and financially of the primary carer and the importance of that to the well-being of the children in her care would point significantly to the best interests of the children being to remain in Northern Ireland". That is a sad indictment of the system in this State. Children must be accommodated as a priority in a safe environment where their welfare can be protected and their natural development nurtured. Essentially, parents need to be able to parent and the family should be self-contained as a family unit as much as possible. For child protection to be at the heart of the reception system, appropriately trained staff should be present within the accommodation system and not simply at a national central point with remote access. As most people know, Ireland is one of only two European Union member states where asylum seekers are prohibited from working after a designated period. The Government argues that extending the right to work for asylum seekers would almost certainly have a profoundly negative impact on application numbers. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The Health Service Executive has documented the negative health effects among asylum seekers of not being able to work: "Lack of entitlement to work, when this restriction extends over a long period, may further compound mental health, with boredom, depression, sense of isolation and loss of self-esteem commonly reported symptoms," it concluded in a recent report. When a person is denied the right to work, he is denied the right to provide for himself, he is denied his individuality and responsibility and there is no sense of control in his life. The matter was aptly put by an academic and journalist:To deny the right to work is to deny a fundamental source of human dignity. Work contributes to a sense of self worth that is essential to well-being. It can be a vital coping mechanism, particularly for people who have suffered trauma and upheaval. That is one of the reasons why the right to work is enshrined in international treaties...including the Refugee Convention and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. To deny asylum seekers the right to work is to put their mental and physical health at risk. The fact is our direct provision system has cost the State an extortionate amount in recent years, but it is providing little in terms of a decent standard of living. The State has given more than €850 million to private firms for the provision of accommodation and food since direct provision was established. Many of these companies are large firms involved in the property, hospitality or catering business. Several have moved to shield their company accounts from public scrutiny and, in some cases, their beneficial owners include companies in offshore jurisdictions such as the Isle of Man or British Virgin Islands. While many cynics would use this information to argue that we already do too much for them or that we should send them all back where they come from, the fact is these costs exist because of the reluctance and resistance to deal with minority groups living in and being processed through an ineffectual system. If the asylum process did not take so long with residents spending many years in the system, costs would be cut immediately. However, as mentioned previously, the single procedure in itself is not the answer. The introduction of a self-catering system instead of handing-out millions to private companies would introduce more transparency as well as respect for family life. It is not a question of costs as much as how we treat our fellow human beings. There is no denying the cost and transparency element involved which, if rectified, would in fact improve how we treat asylum seekers. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has said:When we oppress others, we end up oppressing ourselves. All of our humanity is dependent upon recognizing the humanity in others.Where is the humanity in direct provision? What is needed is an alternative system that respects the human rights and basic needs of each individual and family for the duration of their stay, a system which is efficient and transparent and which allows asylum seekers to be productive in society rather than imprisoned living a life of degradation. I believe what is proposed in the motion would do precisely this. I recognise several Deputies from all parties and none feel strongly on this issue and that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, had a particular interest in this issue as a backbencher and has stated his wishes to reform completely the system numerous times since entering office. I believe we are similarly minded on this issue and I hope he is given the space to do what he is in the Department to do. We have a responsibility as a nation and as a member of the UN Human Rights Council such that when people come to our country looking for protection they are treated with the dignity and respect that should be afforded to all human beings, and that they can live in the knowledge that they and their children will be safe for however long they remain in our country. Therefore, I call on the Government to accept the motion, introduce a strategy for the implementation of the new system and begin on the path to meaningful reform.

I take this opportunity to thank and commend my Independent colleague, Deputy Thomas Pringle, on bringing forward this motion. He has shown great leadership and compassion on this urgent matter and all sides of the House should support him and his motion. I accept that for some people this may not be popular. Yesterday's poll, for example, shows we have a long way to go in respect of changing the mindset of those who are hostile to the sentiments expressed in the motion. I challenge those people tonight. Would they like their son, daughter or brother to live in the direct provision centres with the €9.60 weekly allowance for children? Would they like to see their family in these conditions in a far-off land while waiting for a decision? I put it up to them tonight in the debate. The plight of the migrant is a major, critical issue in the modern world and it is a fact of life today. It is important to remember them as human beings. We have all seen the recent pictures on our televisions of in the region of 120,000 migrants being rescued by the Italian coastguard off the Italian coast. Of these 120,000 a total of 2,200 died in the crossing and in September alone 750 people died. We have also seen another aspect of this issue, that is, the complete humiliation and exploitation of these migrant people. Women have been abused and sexually exploited. These issues are important as well as the details of direct provision. We must look into the heart and soul and the words of this motion and turn them into a reality for these families. When we are dealing with this issue we must speak out against any form of racism in our society. Whether in Ireland or Europe, we must challenge the racists and put an end to this carry on. I encountered an example one and a half years ago in my constituency involving several individuals. I asked an innocent question on direct provision. They photocopied a leaflet and gave it out in a part of my constituency allegedly in a negative way. I put it to those people that I am very proud to stand up and support the rights of people. I am proud to stand tonight with Deputy Thomas Pringle and the Independent Deputies who are standing up for the rights of people. I put it to them that they should consider our history and the Famine. They should consider our families and extended families who had to go to other countries. We all have relations in America, Australia and throughout the world. They had to emigrate as well. We are part of the process. Only in the past week we saw the great Galway man, Marty Walsh, home on a visit to Ireland, Galway and Dublin. He was elected mayor of Boston. I listened to the details of his interview and how he got elected by a cross-section of Boston society. He got a good deal of support from different communities and used his vote in a very positive way. It is important that we use these examples because as I speak there are children in the centres who could be doctors, scientists and leaders of tomorrow. We have to focus on those people and their qualities. The issue of cost comes up regularly. I gather the figure is between €17 million and €19 million per annum in public money although I am unsure whether that is an accurate figure. People have put it to me that a considerable amount of money is being made on legal fees. We need to examine these figures. It is important to examine factually the details of Deputy Thomas Pringle's motion. There are over 4,300 asylum seekers in the 34 direct provision centres in the State. Some of them have been living in these centres for up to ten years. One third of the residents are children. The direct provision system is an ineffective and costly system that is not fit for purpose. Concerns have been raised by the United Nations Human Rights Committee regarding the prolonged accommodation of asylum seekers in direct provision centres. The committee suggested this was not conducive to family life. Concerns were also raised by the special rapporteur on child protection in respect of the detrimental effect of direct provision accommodation on children and parents' ability to provide adequate care. We have seen the social injustice of denying children residing in direct provision centres the opportunity to progress to third level education.The personal allowances are €19.10 per week for an adult and €9.60 for a child. These are important facts. The Minister has set up a working group. He should get on with the job, given that there is cross-party support for helping these people. There should not be a fudge or any messing around. We need to consider sensible actions that could be taken. I would like the Minister to provide for the transfer of residents to independent living within six months if a decision on a person’s status has not been reached by then. The prohibition on employment should be lifted to allow residents of direct provision centres to work within six months. We need to introduce a strategy for implementation of the new system and a mechanism that allows asylum seekers that have begun the process of applying for asylum in Ireland to be fast-tracked. If Government Members support justice, equality and respect for the person, they will support the motion at 9 o'clock tomorrow night.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate, and I compliment Deputy Pringle, who tabled the motion. He has been interested in this issue for many a long year and he is supportive of a change in the direct provision system. That view is becoming more widely accepted. The system is detrimental to families and individuals and, in particular, children. I am particularly disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment. It is unnecessary, because the House should not be divided on this issue. There is significant cross-party support for a change to the system and, even at this late stage, I call on the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment and allow the motion to be passed unanimously by the House and implemented in the near future. I deal with asylum seekers on a regular basis. There is a direct provision facility, Bridgewater House, in Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency. It has been in operation for some time. There are excellent relations and good interactions between the asylum seekers and the local community and there is excellent support from the community for the residents and their children. The children attend local schools and are involved in many local organisations, including the GAA, while also participating in many traditional cultural events. Many of the adults are engaged in education and training and they are supported through the Nano Nagle centre in Carrick-on-Suir. Everybody in the town should be complimented on the good interaction and support provided for the residents of Bridgewater House. As Deputy Pringle said, this is the 14th year of direct provision. Approximately 4,300 asylum seekers are currently resident in 34 centres in the State, many of whom have been in the centres for up to ten years, while a few have been there even longer. More than 1,600 of them are young people under the age of 18, and there is no doubt the system is having a negative effect on them, in particular, and on families. There is widespread support for the view that this system needs to be changed, although that view was held in some parts of society from the beginning. A retired Supreme Court judge, the former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, the Special Rapporteur for Children, many civil society organisations, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and numerous politicians have come to share this view. I hope the Minister of State will withdraw the amendment and agree to the passage of the motion unanimously. A total of 4,360 persons are in direct provision, of whom 2,800 live in 851 family units. Some 1,666 residents are aged under 18, while another 451 are aged between 18 and 25. Although the numbers in the system have decreased over the past number of years, the length of stay in the centres has increased significantly and there is no doubt that now is the time to change the system. The 34 centres are located in 18 counties but only three were purpose-built for accommodation. The remainder are former hotels, hostels or guest houses, convents, nursing homes and so on, which were never intended for long-term residents. This is not good for individual residents and it is particularly negative for children. Since the introduction of the system in 2000, the weekly personal allowance has not changed. It remains €19.10 per week for an adult and €9.60 for each child. There are serious concerns about the effect the system is having on children. Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, the Special Rapporteur for Children, has mentioned this in his reports. For instance, he stated:The particular needs of children in the Direct Provision system should be examined with a view to establishing whether the system itself is detrimental to their welfare and development and, if appropriate, an alternative form of support and accommodation adopted which is more suitable for families and particularly children. In the interim, the state should implement without delay an independent complaints mechanism and independent inspections of Direct Provision centres and give consideration to these being undertaken through either HIQA (inspections) or the Ombudsman for Children (complaints)... Research is needed on the specific vulnerability of children accommodated in the system of Direct Provision and the potential or actual harm which is being created by particular circumstances of their residence, including the inability of parents to properly care for and protect their children and the damage that may be done by living for a lengthy period of time in an institutionalised setting which was not designed for long-term residents.This is a particularly damning view. The system is detrimental to children and needs to be changed urgently. The UN Human Rights Committee has also addressed the issue in a report, stating: "The Committee is concerned at the lack of a single application procedure for consideration of all grounds for international protection." I again ask the Minister of State not to introduce the amendment because Deputies agree more than they disagree on this issue. Rather than divide on the motion, the House should pass it unanimously. 
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	357	I thank Deputy Thomas Pringle for framing and introducing the motion. The Technical Group has a rota for Private Members' business and there is always a long list of issues Deputies would like to discuss. Deputy Pringle was particularly determined that the House would debate the issue of direct provision. All Deputies will remember the night we had survivors of the Magdalen laundries in the Gallery. It was an unusual occasion because we stood up and applauded these women for surviving what the State did to them. The State also has survivors of industrial schools and mother and baby homes. It seems that those who are in the wrong category at a given time in this State must survive. Many of us have read about the views that prevailed in this country when certain sets of circumstances were allowed to persist. It has been horrifying to learn of some of the values that more or less shaped the policies which resulted in a hidden Ireland in which we sought to hide things away. In many ways, asylum seekers in the direct provision system have also been hidden away as it is only relatively recently that they started to become vocal. People in the direct provision system should not have to survive the State. Approximately 70 million people claim Irish ancestry. Ireland has not failed in terms of distributing its population to other countries. Many Irish people were not treated well abroad. The way in which Irish people were treated in London and elsewhere in the 1950s and 1960s horrified us. We must ask if what we are doing today is any better.  Direct provision was introduced in 2000 by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government as a short-term solution to the changing profile of migration. It was intended to last for perhaps six months. No one anticipated that people would live in direct provision for up to 14 year or that large numbers of children would spend virtually their entire childhoods in these arrangements. We need to visualise what this means for such children. They will not have a normal home or family life and their parents will not have any prospect of securing employment. Ireland and Lithuania are the only countries in the European Union which deny asylum seekers all opportunities to work. The current system essentially steals childhood opportunities from the children of asylum seekers. Deputy Healy referred to children integrating in the community by participating in sport and so forth. Such integration is difficult to achieve when families receive €9.60 per week for each child. Participation requires charity from the communities in which direct provision centres are hosted. While there is generally good will among such communities, such charity should not be required. We must dismantle the current arrangement which is unacceptable, particularly in the 21st century.  Ireland has a proud record on overseas aid. Even in these tough times, we continue to support some of the most vulnerable communities in the world. It is odd that we are concerned about incurring reputational damage on money markets and so forth, yet our treatment of those seeking asylum is placing at risk the proud record we have built up on overseas aid. Many asylum seekers come here having experienced war and direct violence and it is no longer safe for them to return home. Those who have fled often find it most difficult to produce paperwork because they had to flee in difficult circumstances or at short notice. This makes it difficult for them to corroborate their case, as they are entitled to do.  The rate of acceptance of asylum applications in Ireland is among the lowest in the European Union. I understand the EU average is 12% compared with 5% here. This issue needs to be examined to ensure we do not return people to countries where their lives will be at risk.  The total cost of direct provision fell from €86 million in 2008 to €65 million in 2013. This is a substantial cost for a highly unsatisfactory arrangement. As Deputies are aware, adults in the direct provision system are paid €19.10 per week, while children receive €9.60 per week. We must take account of school, medical and transport costs for children. It is dreadful that people have been placed in a position in which some resort to prostitution. There is ample evidence that many direct provision centres are not fit for human habitation. Accommodation in some of them is substandard, with some people living in a single room, heating systems are inefficient and spaces are cramped. The situation is reminiscent of the Dublin tenements. It is not extreme to compare the thinking behind the direct provision system with the view taken when the workhouses were established, in other words, they should be made extremely unattractive in the hope that nobody will enter them. That is the type of thinking involved. It is unacceptable that the system was designed in this manner.  I accept what previous speakers said in respect of the Minister of State's bona fides in this area. He will, I am sure, accept that the current system of inspections is inadequate. I hope he will secure the support of both parties in government to take immediate action on the direct provision system. Independent, non-departmental inspections similar to those carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority must be allowed. The Ombudsman for Children should be given a role in respect of children in direct provision as I believe that office would produce highly critical reports on the system on the basis of the stories and complaints made about it.  Asylum applications must also be processed quicker. If this requires a relaxation in the recruitment embargo, so be it because we must bring closure to asylum applicants and ensure they are given a fair and speedy decision on their cases.  I echo Deputy Healy's view that the House should not divide on the motion. Deputies should be able to find sufficient common ground to enable us to address the issue of direct provision. While the problem affects only a small number of people, the impact on them is very adverse. I call on the Government to rethink its amendment and instead accept this reasonable motion.

I appreciate his sentiments in this regard.  I welcome the opportunity to speak about the system of direct provision because, as made clear in the new statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016, the Government is committed to addressing not only the issues arising in relation to the system of direct provision but also the issues which need to be addressed in the context of the wider protection process. The statement of Government priorities contains a number of interconnected commitments in the area of international protection for this purpose. These include the commitment to legislate to reduce the length of time an applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single application procedure by way of a dedicated protection Bill; and the commitment to establish an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements in the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. The single protection procedure we will put in place will ensure Ireland continues to meet its international obligations and in a way which is both efficient and fair. This reform will simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the direct provision system and the costs to the taxpayer. That will equally allow us to address issues which now arise in the context of the system of dispersal and direct provision. It is no secret that I have been and continue to be a critic of the direct provision system as it currently operates. I want to see it reformed into something of which we can be proud in a civilised society that describes itself as a republic. I have described the system as inhumane and intolerable and I refuse to stand over it in its current form. I am particularly mindful of the position of families and children. We need to ensure the facilities we have in place are capable of meeting the needs of families in circumstances where their cases are ongoing for protracted periods. We need to ensure, in particular, that the length of time people are spending in the system does not mean that children's only experience of life is of life in the direct provision system. The needs of children will be a key issue to be addressed in the reform of the system. Therefore, I want change. In particular, I want to see changes made to the system in the short term which will have a direct benefit for those residing in centres as quickly as possible. That is why I very much look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and my other colleagues in government in taking forward these commitments in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality. The motion appears to acknowledge that change cannot occur overnight and I welcome this. We need to be sure the changes we make are ones we are capable of delivering on and sustaining into the future. We also need to take account of the fact that the system of direct provision does not operate in isolation from the overall protection process and that it is important that we address all relevant issues in the context of that process as a whole. There are lessons to be learned from the circumstances in which the system of direct provision and dispersal were introduced and it is important that we do not lose sight of this. Direct provision was the public policy response to a major accommodation crisis at the time. We must be careful not to create a new one in circumstances where there are already considerable pressures in the housing market. The Government introduced the system in 1999 in response to an increase in the number of persons applying for asylum, which rose to 7,724 in that year from a figure of 424 only four years previously. That upward trend and the concentration of asylum seekers in the Dublin area meant that the accommodation services there were, understandably, unable to cope. The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, was consequently established to put in place arrangements which would enable the accommodation needs of protection seekers arriving in the State to be met. The direct provision system has, nonetheless, succeeded in the period since in meeting the housing and other immediate needs of over 51,000 asylum seekers. No one has ever been turned away or left homeless. The difficulty is that a short-term emergency measure has become long-term policy.  The system of direct provision and dispersal has also enabled the housing, education and health needs of asylum seekers to be met in a manner which has avoided overburdening services in Dublin and other urban areas. It has in this way facilitated the mainstreaming of these services for asylum seekers, ensured they access the same services and that their children attend the same schools as their peers in the communities in which they live. We need to ensure these beneficial aspects of the system are preserved. The system of direct provision has shown itself capable of responding in a flexible way as the number of asylum seekers arriving in the State has ebbed and flowed. The number of persons residing in direct provision accommodation peaked at 8,080 in 2005. The decline since has meant that the number of direct provision centres has fallen from over 70 to the 34 now in operation. The most recent closure took place in July 2013. The annual budget for direct provision accommodation, at its highest, in 2008, exceeded €91 million. This year the cost will be approximately €51 million, a reduction of 40%. The number now in direct provision accommodation is approximately 4,300 which represents a reduction of 3,780 persons or 46% compared with the high point. The numbers residing in direct provision accommodation reflect, in part, the number of asylum applications being made. The number of applications had increased from the low hundreds in the early 1990s to 7,724 in 1999 when the decision to introduce the system of direct provision was made and was later to peak at 11,634 in 2002. The number of asylum applications has declined in the period since, reaching 946 last year. The numbers of asylum seekers presenting themselves can clearly have implications for processing times, as well as the nature of the accommodation that can be provided. That is why it is important that we consolidate the improvements made in recent times in processing times. The reducing numbers being accommodated in the system also offer the possibility of improving conditions for everyone. The average length of time persons spend in the direct provision system has been increasing year on year for some time and is a particular issue of concern to the Government, as well as to me. There are, however, many reasons this is so. An analysis undertaken earlier this year revealed that approximately 50% of persons in the direct provision system had either judicial review applications pending, were the subject of deportation orders, or were seeking leave to remain in the State for non-protection reasons. A recent examination of cases in the direct provision system suggested that, in the overwhelming majority of cases in the system longer than four years, the applicants or their family members had legal proceedings pending, having exhausted all of the processes in the protection system. I mention these facts for the purpose of setting out the context for the work we have to do, not in any way to apologise for the system as it is constituted. That also explains why we have decided to proceed by way of the establishment of an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements to the protection process as a whole, as well as the system of direct provision and supports for asylum seekers, in particular. The necessary work for the purpose of establishing the working group is well under way.  Both the Minister and I hosted a round-table consultation on 18 September. The round-table discussion brought together a wide range of organisations that have been working in the field of refugees and asylum seekers or have a particular perspective to bring to their needs. I take the opportunity to thank the Irish Refugee Council for its assistance in organising the round-table discussion. The groups represented were the Irish Refugee Council, as well as a representative of its core group of asylum seekers and refugees, AkiDwA, Cultúr, Doras Luimní, the Jesuit Refugee Service, Mayo Intercultural Action, NASC, SPIRASI, Tralee International Resource Centre, the Crosscare Migrant and Refugee Project, Dublin Aids Alliance, BeLonG To Youth, Children's Rights Alliance, FLAG, Barnardos and the Integration Centre. Representatives of the UNHCR and Amnesty also attended. Both the Minister and I benefited greatly from their insights into the operation of the direct provision system.  The main purpose of the round-table discussion was to enable the groups to outline key issues for them concerning the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers and the direct provision system. The outcome of the round-table discussion has helped to clarify the issues the working group will need to address.The results of the round-table consultation will inform in more detail the terms of reference of the working group, which the Minister will announce shortly along with the membership of the group. The working group is to be chaired by former High Court judge and presiding officer of our citizenship ceremonies Bryan MacMahon.
I expect that the membership will include representation from a wide range of interests in this area and include NGOs, advocacy groups working with children and other vulnerable people, refugees and representatives from all relevant Departments that have a role to play in providing supports and services to protection applicants. The Minister's intention is that the working group will be asked to submit a first report to the Government by the end of the year.  In advance of the round-table consultation, we had already identified a number of indicative themes with a view to guiding the discussion without limiting those contributing to those themes. These were the material needs of applicants in direct provision, including the direct provision allowance and exceptional needs payments; the needs of families and persons with special needs in direct provision, with reference to the accommodation portfolio; the arrangements for handling complaints and inspections; how linkages with local communities can be improved; support for residents when transitioning to life in the community; whether limitations should be placed on the length of time persons spend in direct provision; supports for protection applicants, including in regard to education, training, health care, social welfare entitlements and access to employment; and issues relating to the international protection determination process. The final remit of the working group will now be determined in the light of the outcome of the round-table consultation. This will ensure that all relevant issues are approached in a structured and considered way. There is a sovereign requirement for Ireland to maintain balanced and appropriate immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that those who come to our shores to seek the protection of our State are dealt with fairly, humanely, expeditiously and in accordance with both domestic and EU law and rules. As a country and a people, we can justifiably say we are playing our part in this respect. Over the past 14 years or so, close to 40,000 immigrants who came here and utilised our protection and related processes have been allowed to remain in the State on a permanent basis. Indeed, very many of these have proceeded to become Irish citizens.  We will, of course, continue to honour our solemn international duty in the area of protection. However, we do not have limitless resources and we simply cannot operate an immigration policy which leaves us open to being targeted by those who trade in human misery, no more than we are in a position to provide for the vast number of economic migrants who seek a better life. It would be wrong for us to pretend otherwise or to offer simplistic solutions to what are truly complex and difficult issues of public policy with which governments all over Europe are struggling to grapple.  The statement of Government priorities also includes a second key commitment, which is to legislate to reduce the time an applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single application procedure by way of a dedicated protection Bill. This is a key Government priority as it will be essential to removing structural delays, which are a feature of the existing protection system. Work on the Bill has already commenced. We are aiming to publish it in January 2015 with a view to its enactment by Easter next year. The key purpose of the Bill is to establish a single applications procedure and, as I indicated, simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. It will mean that all aspects of protection - asylum and subsidiary protection – in addition to any non-protection grounds that may prevent the Minister from deporting a person in the event of protection being refused, will be investigated and decided upon at the same time. It will, as a consequence, reduce the time that applicants spend in the direct provision system.  There has been some comment on the single procedure being of no benefit to persons already in the system. The benefit of a single procedure would not necessarily be limited to new applicants. The introduction of a single procedure for new applicants would raise the question as to what extent the new procedure could be applied to cases already in the system. The details in that regard are currently being examined in my Department.  I would like in closing to refer to some recent events. As Deputies will be aware, there are a number of ongoing protests in direct provision centres around the country. I fully respect the right of residents to protest and express their concerns about the living conditions or the protection process. At the same time, I am concerned about the impact the protests can have on children and other vulnerable persons living in the centres. Other aspects of the protests have been quite disquieting. These have included the targeting of individuals working in certain direct provision centres and the stopping of people going about their work. I know from my visits to the centres that the persons working there, in addition to those in the Reception and Integration Agency, are working on a day-to-day basis in the interests of the residents and bring real commitment to their work that often goes far beyond what is required of them. I would not like to see the good relationships that exist in most centres undermined. Issues outside the control of the Reception and Integration Agency and local centre management, such as the time spent in centres and the right to employment, are issues that will be addressed by the working group which is being established. Direct provision, as the motion makes clear, has existed for 14 years now. It is not something that can simply be wished away or ended immediately. The Government has also to take account of the broader context of the challenging picture in regard to the public finances and the competing demands on them. The Government is nevertheless committed to change and to bringing about real improvements to the protection process and the arrangements in place for accommodating asylum seekers. That is why we will be tasking the working group to report back to the Government within a very tight timeframe. We have form in this regard. We pledged to end the degrading practice of slopping out in Mountjoy and we did so. We pledged to close St. Patrick's Institution for Young Offenders and we have done so. We will not be found wanting in respect of direct provision. I ask the House to allow the working group the time to undertake that work and to support the Government’s counter-motion. 
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	360	I support the overwhelming desire of the motion and counter-motion to reform the system of direct provision. This is a welcome debate and a matter on which I have campaigned and spoken in the House on several occasions. It is important that, as a Parliament, we reaffirm our belief in the refugee system and recognise our international obligation to those who are fleeing persecution based on race, nationality, political opinion or membership of a social group. We should say we need and respect the system and recognise our duties in that regard because they are often forgotten in the debate. We need only to note the disturbances and turmoil right across the world to realise there are people who must genuinely flee the place they live because of these kinds of pressures. While we have an international obligation, it is natural to have a system in place to decide who is a refugee deserving of protection and who is not. A call must be made. What we have, however, is a shambles and does not work. In the first instance, we take people very quickly after they get off the plane or other means of transport and throw them into a system without obtaining adequate information or making a correct assessment. There should be proper legal aid, discussion with the asylum seeker, etc.  Second, we have a refugee appeals tribunal which, although it has significantly improved, rejected case after case for years. The Minister of State mentioned the 40,000 people who have been allowed to remain here. I question how many have been granted refugee status. Owing to the inadequacies of the legislation and decisions that are so dodgy that they merit judicial review, people spend years in direct provision.  I came across the plight of those in direct provision before I was even a councillor, back in 2008 when I used to work with Michael D. Higgins. We used to hold a clinic in the Menlo Park Hotel, opposite Lisbrook House, which was then a refugee centre. We used to deal with case after case involving people going through the system. Would the Minister of State believe that I am still dealing with some of them? There are people in the Eglington Hostel in Salthill, which the Minister of State visited with me, who are in the system for ten or 11 years. They have children who are ten years old who have spent their entire lives living in the direct provision system. If ever there were an example demonstrating that the current system is not only in need of improvement but also wrong and not working, that is it.  There are two steps we need to take. First, the working group the Minister of State has set up, on which I commend him, needs to put in place a system that works. Simply putting in place a new combined procedure with subsidiary protection and refugee status and applying it to or grafting it onto the current system is not enough; the current system and its processes, by which people should be treated fairly and in which their applications should be dealt with comprehensively, needs to be examined also. I ask that the working group do so. Second, we need to deal compassionately with those who have been in the system for so long and acknowledge the system we have in place is not working and should be made better. We need to examine the conditions and amount we pay people. What we really need to do is embrace the reality that the people who have been in the system for ten or 11 years and who have children here are going to stay.I have not come across one such family which has been told to go home. Let us get the system working and treat these people with the urgency required, because the nihilism, waste of human potential and emptiness that existence brings with it, of living in and sharing one room and having limited moneys with which to go out and interact with society, have a damaging impact, not only on people's well-being but also on their mental health and ambitions as human beings. A number of people have attempted to discuss and do something about this issue. When I used to question the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, about the legislation coming through, he constantly reported that the new protection Bill was just six months away. That was back in 2011, when I was first elected to this House. Every time he was asked about it, it was just another six months away. I am not sure what it is about the Department, but when it comes to reforming this area of law and the asylum system, something is wrong and it cannot get it done. Will the Minister of State be vigilant and ensure he pushes this reform through, because it seems there is a reluctance to reform it? I am concerned by and uncomfortable with the fact that Ireland has opted out of the EU common European asylum system. This common system sets out basic human rights and nothing more. It guarantees basic reception conditions which incorporate human rights as asserted by the European Court of Justice. One of these basic rights is the reception conditions directive, which mandates conditions to which people are entitled in asylum seeking centres. We have not signed up to that directive. The basic conditions include the right to work and so on. The European Court of Justice has said this is a basic human right and we need to look at that as well.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	361	What can I say after that speech by Deputy Nolan? It very much encapsulates my views. I thank Deputy Nolan for the strength of his contribution, both tonight and on other occasions when he has spoken publicly on this issue in drawing attention to the scandal of the system in this country. I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and thank him for the visits he is making to direct provision centres throughout the country, including one in my local area. It was interesting to get access to a centre and see it from the inside. I wish the Minister of State luck in making progress on this issue, but he needs to be aware of Deputy Nolan's comment regarding the obstacles he faces, because there are many obstacles to making progress with the system. These need to be overcome as quickly as possible. I heard Deputy Nolan on radio describe our asylum system as the Magdalen laundries of the 21st century. I wish I could say he was talking rubbish, but I cannot. If the centres are like the one I visited a week ago with the Minister of State, while the basic provision in terms of shelter, accommodation and food is made, it is provided in such a way as to make it difficult for people to live as individuals or families. People live in restricted conditions. For example, last week we saw three unrelated adult women sharing a room. They probably did not even have the same ethnic background. We saw a family sharing a room, with parents and children sharing the room for a considerable length of time. These situations might be fine if they lasted no longer than six months, but they go on. Yesterday, a man who has been in the direct provision system for ten years visited my advice centre. He is still being threatened with being sent home and must appear before the Garda National Immigration Bureau every couple of months. We need a system in place that will deal with people as quickly as possible. I am aware the Minister for Justice and Equality has plans for a process that will take from one year to 18 months. The shorter the period, the better. The current system is unacceptable. As many contributors on this have said, the fact that children can be born and live in this situation for years is a bad introduction to the world. If these children are granted the right to remain in Ireland, what chance do they have of growing up to be decent, upstanding, well-balanced members of the community? The same goes for their parents. Some of the problems these people must deal with are mental health issues, uncertainty, boredom and the temptation to go down the wrong track. I have heard many allegations of prostitution from some of those living in asylum centres. We need a solution to this issue. First, people must be granted a quick decision. If we could get to that position, people would either be told they cannot stay and must leave the country or they can join the workforce and begin to live their own lives rather than live with their lives on hold. I look forward to hearing what and how quickly progress will be made. The Minister of State faces a difficult task, but he must get on with it as soon as possible. I have one question for him, namely, what legislation, if any, the direct provision system operates under currently.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I welcome the Minister of State and welcome the debate on this important issue. There are two extremes in the context of a debate on direct provision and the wider area of immigration. First is the view that there should be no immigration or inflow of people, whether immigrant workers or asylum seekers, into the State. The other view is that there should be complete freedom of movement, unfettered and unhindered by national borders. These views are both extreme and ludicrous. It is the State's sovereign right to define its borders and regulate movement into the State. Our membership of the European Union carries with it a core freedom, the free movement of people throughout the Union. Ireland does not exist in a vacuum. It has an economy that has vacancies, some of which can only be filled by persons from abroad who are accommodated by the employment permit legislation. The jobs in question vary, but they are highly specialised and important for the economy. In an increasingly unstable world, there are human rights violations on an horrendous scale and we have a duty and obligation to assist those who seek help. All of these points impact on the direct provision system. It is indisputable that there will always be a need for a system to process and address unplanned arrivals into the State. The current system of direct provision is beset with problems and is inadequate for many of those within it. Like others, I have raised the issue of reform of the system on several occasions - in May 2011, November 2011, October 2012, December 2013, February 2014, and most recently in June. Some of the suggestions I have made include permitting the Ombudsman to examine complaints or issues raised by residents in the system, the plans of Ministers to reform the system and the efforts to reduce by as much as possible the amount of time spent within the system. Thankfully, the numbers in the system have been falling, but it is an unsettling fact that some people have spent years within the direct provision system. Families have been and are being reared in single rooms. Single people must share rooms with people of a completely different culture and in many cases they share no common language.This is unacceptable. The appeals system in the area of immigration is also a problem. It needs to be streamlined and made more straightforward, but the decisions of the various adjudicating bodies also needs to be respected. We cannot have a system of endless appeals. The State has the right at the end of the day to adjudicate on behalf of citizens. Since the restatement of Government priorities, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, have made several important commitments which I enthusiastically welcome. These include the establishment of a working group to report to the Government on the improvements within the protection system, including direct provision, and also to reduce the length of time that people are waiting within the system. I also welcome the fact the round-table talks have commenced, and these will set the terms of reference for the working group. NGOs have outlined a number of areas about which they have concerns, including the allowance for direct provision, the exceptional needs payment, the limitations on the length of time spent, the inspections and complaints procedure, educational issues and the dignity of people within the direct provision system. It is worth noting that numbers have been greatly reduced but they are still too high, with over 4,500 people within the system. The number of new applicants has fallen greatly from over 2,000 in 2009 to 404 now, although, again, this is still too high. The overwhelming majority of people who have been there for a number of years are there because they have this protracted legal procedure to exhaust before a decision is made. I would welcome any commitment to reduce the time needed for this. Obviously, the system is not perfect, although I note that it has prevented homelessness in one case. Unfortunately, as a State, we have many other challenges outside of the direct provision system, including homelessness, social housing shortages and problems with rental accommodation. There is also a larger issue that has to be looked at. Sweden is a country that is often looked at as being very liberal in regard to the whole asylum area but it has its own challenges. It was a big issue in the recent Swedish elections and it has required almost a doubling of the budget over the next four years to try to deal with this situation, given it is handling many refugees from countries such as Syria and Somalia. I wish the Minister of State well. I commend him on what he has done so far and commend the Government on its work. I hope a solution can be found to end the indignity of people having to spend years in direct provision while their applications are being processed.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion and the issues surrounding direct provision in Ireland. Fianna Fáil shares a number of concerns surrounding the policy of direct provision, in particular the excessively long waiting time before an asylum application has been decided. It is clear to all of us that there is a significant problem surrounding the length of time a person spends in direct provision. Current statistics show that 46% of residents are there for three years or more and a further 14% have been there for seven years or more. This is clearly unacceptable, in particular for children whose earlier years are being impacted by the unsuitable living conditions of the direct provision facilities for families. Fianna Fáil sought to pass legislation in 2010 - the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 - which allowed for a new single, integrated process of application for protection which would replace applications for refugee status, subsidiary protection and leave to remain. This legislative provision has yet to be implemented. The Department of Justice and Equality has stated that the main factor that contributes to upward trends in waiting time "is the length of time in the protection-humanitarian leave determining process", including legal proceedings. We know that one of the biggest factors affecting the time delay in the direct provision system is the lack of a single application process for asylum. It would seem obvious to us that the bringing forward of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, or a similar Bill, would go some way towards reducing the delay currently experienced in the direct provision system. I believe we in this House would all agree with reform of the current system. What we need is a system which is humane, fair, timely and effective in dealing with applications. We need to ensure that Ireland is not seen as a soft target for people who have spurious claims for asylum, in order to protect against people who would seek to abuse our system. Equally, we need to ensure that those with a genuine application are dealt with and granted asylum with speed. We also need to ensure that those who seek to undermine our application system, who are not genuine in their approach and who deliberately abuse the processes laid down by the system, are dealt with in equal speed. We have a duty, as Members of this House, to protect the interests, safety and well-being of the Irish people while also seeking to fulfil our international duties and obligations by offering our State as a safe haven for those who are persecuted in their own countries. In previous centuries, it was Irish people who sought asylum in other countries at a time when being a member of a particular faith or political outlook resulted in persecution. As a country and a people which has experienced political persecution and mass emigration, we must address this issue with the urgency and seriousness required, informed by our own history. We can only fulfil those duties by putting in place a robust system for dealing with asylum applications and guaranteeing as best we can its integrity and efficiency. The current system, I believe, falls significantly short in fulfilling those duties despite significant expenditure on direct provision by the Department of Justice and Equality. Although there have been reductions in expenditure, in what I assume is in line with declining numbers in direct provision centres over the past five years, the State still spends over €50 million on accommodation costs for this system. The legal costs per year still exceed €6 million, with judicial review alone costing approximately €2.2 million this year. Yet, the fact our system currently has an average length of stay of 48 months, and that a total of 1,686 people have spent a minimum of five years in the system, is extremely concerning. We also have a situation where approximately 604 people have been in direct provision for seven years or more. This is an outrageous figure and shows there is a failure arising in the State's legal mechanisms to deal with these cases in a manner which is in any way effective, humane or fair. One thing we must ensure is that any change or reform to the system as it currently stands must also deal with the people who are currently in the system. We cannot allow a situation arise where those who are currently engaged in the direct provision system today will not benefit from any proposed reforms of the system. That would be grossly unfair and something my party could not support. I hope the Minister might be able to give a commitment in this regard. I also put forward that priority should be given to families in direct provision who have been waiting inordinate amounts of time for their applications to be decided. We cannot allow further delay which may result in young children growing up in Ireland, being educated and making friends here, only to be deported at some unknown date in the future. That is quite simply playing games with people's lives and is just not acceptable. The Minister should have some discretion in this regard and be conscious of the impact such a decision would have on any young family in that situation. The conditions at direct provision centres for families in general are also a concern. At a recent protest at a direct provision centre in Cork, a number of mothers who have been living there for periods reaching up to nine years stated they had serious concerns about food but also about the effect on people's mental well-being. The indefinite duration of the review of their applications served to create great instability and fear in their lives. While I understand the public finances have been under strain for the past number of years, I consider that proper food should be able to be provided to those in direct provision, given this country's ability to produce some of the best food in the world. I want it noted too that the budget of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has been cut by €5 million since 2011, which may have resulted in further waiting and delay for many in the direct provision system. The budget allocation, including Supplementary Estimate adjustments as appropriate, for the operation of INIS, including wages and salaries and running costs, was €52.5 million, €43.5 million, €49.5 million and €47.5 million, respectively, for the years 2011 to 2014. In response to a recent parliamentary question which I submitted, it was outlined that the staffing levels of INIS, which forms part of the Department of Justice and Equality, ranged from 615 in 2011 to its current level of 519 full-time equivalents.That is a loss of almost 100 staff in the space of three years, which is bound to have a significant impact on the processing times INIS is able to provide. The equivalent budget allocations for the direct provision system ranged from €67.5 million in 2011 to €47.5 million this year. I put it to the Minister of State that the cuts to the budgets of both INIS and the direct provision system have resulted in a slowdown in the advancement of applications for asylum, which has resulted in many of the protests we see at centres across the country. I urge the Minister of State to introduce legislation to create a system for dealing with asylum applications that will be fair, fast and robust. The current waiting times for decisions with regard to these applications are embarrassing and must be addressed immediately. We in Fianna Fáil will support proposals from the Government which will address these issues if they are fair, reasonable and robust. I hope the Minister of State will be able to bring legislation before this House quite quickly. My party and I are very concerned about this issue. I raised it last week with the Minister as a priority question. In fairness, she is minded to deal with the issue. I also articulated my opinion that HIQA and the Ombudsman for Children should have oversight capacity in terms of reviewing standards. I also mentioned the two direct provision centres in my part of the country. There is one in Mount Trenchard in my constituency and another on the outskirts of Limerick city in Knockalisheen, which is technically in county Clare but is part of Limerick city. Those people have been engaged in protests recently in Limerick to articulate their concerns. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of Doras Luimní, which acts as a support and advocacy agency. I take the opportunity to compliment Doras Luimní because I work with it as much as I can. It refers people to my advice centre. It is a truly fantastic organisation that works not only with refugees and asylum seekers but also with those trapped in prostitution and those who have been trafficked into this country. It is a truly outstanding organisation and I am sure that when the Minister of State visits Limerick, he will meet it. I know he has indicated that he intends to visit Limerick in the near future and I would be glad to accompany him to either of the direct provision centres in the Limerick area when he does so.

I referenced them last week during Question Time with the Minister. I must also put on the record again the sheer frustration we felt when we raised the matter with the previous Minister, Deputy Shatter, over the past three years. Both in this Chamber and in committee rooms, he repeatedly defended this system. He acknowledged some of the challenges but felt it was the best we could offer. It has been a really frustrating number of years, which is why a fresh approach is welcome. I believe the Minister of State will seek to address this issue, but I am a bit concerned about the Minister. I felt she was not using the same emphasis as the Minister of State in her statements last week. On reflection afterwards, I was fearful that we might not have a sense of urgency around this - a need to catch up with three lost years. I made the point to the Minister that, based on her response, I felt that there was a rowing back from some of the statements the Minister of State had made publicly and that there was a more cautious approach and a qualification around some of the comments that were being made. This is why I welcome this motion tonight. There is no legislative footing for these direct provision centres and they can be removed if the Government deems it necessary. I appreciate that the Government needs to put in place some type of system and to deal with the fact that there have been these crazy delays in the application process and that appeals run on for years. In 1987, I read a book by the late Ray Crotty which revealed that since the foundation of the Irish State, half of Irish citizens who survived childhood - not factoring in those who died during childhood - emigrated. From 1922 to 1987 - 65 years - half of all citizens who survived childhood emigrated from Ireland. That is our legacy. Today, as we speak, emigration is happening again - to Australia, the US, Canada, Great Britain and all over the world. Yet again, we are losing our young people to emigration. We would never for a moment tolerate our young people being treated the way we have treated people who have come to this country. Can one imagine "Liveline" with Joe Duffy and the discussion on every local radio station? There would be documentaries every week on every station in this State telling the stories. We would not put up with it. We would have dealt with it. Of all the nations on this earth, I would say that per capita, very few have our emigration levels. There are very few countries that have had to rely more on their brothers and sisters internationally to give them a future. I am not advocating an open-door system. There needs to be a process to ensure that people who genuinely need asylum are assessed properly. We have left people in these centres with food that is not culturally applicable. I listened to one of the reports on RTE radio about deep-fried food and frozen food served every day to people who are used to healthy and diverse choices. This is one of the less serious criticisms. I am talking about the way children are treated within the system. This has been ongoing for years and years. The way children are corralled into tight spaces is an appalling indictment of the way we made up that policy 14 years ago in response to very different circumstances. We have not dealt with the fact that they have changed dramatically.  I know the Minister of State is sincere about this and is trying to address it, but I hope his senior colleague has the same sense of urgency about this issue. This will be proved in the next period of time. We need to give the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner oversight of the direct provision system. They have repeatedly asked for it. The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, will appear before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions tomorrow and I know he is going to ask for it again. He is also the Information Commissioner. We need to give oversight of this system to the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner because it is public money but, more importantly, because it is about people's rights. While they are not citizens of Ireland, we have received a welcome all over the world. The least we can do when people are waiting for a decision is to treat them with dignity and have oversight of that. I wish the Minister of State good luck with his work, and if he continues in the same light he will have the support of this side of the House.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	The back to education allowance (BTEA) programme is designed to support certain recipients of social welfare payments to pursue courses of education with the objective of improving their chances of accessing work. To qualify, a customer must satisfy a number of conditions such as, inter alia, being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, and pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college. A waiting period is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources, to prevent exploitation of the scheme, and to meet the policy objectives with respect to activation. BTEA should not be seen as an alternative to student income supports provided by the Department of Education and Skills.  With respect to jobseekers, a customer may qualify for BTEA if they have been on a jobseeker’s payment for 78 days if they wish to pursue a second level option. This increases to 234 days if they wish to pursue a third level option. Periods on eligible social welfare payments that are not broken by more than twelve months can be combined in determining the required qualifying period for BTEA. Given the nature of BTEA, it is possible that the scheme can provide an incentive for customers to remain on a jobseekers payment to qualify. The risk of this occurring has been significantly reduced by improved case management of all new jobseekers and new selection processes for BTEA which were introduced during 2014. These include enhanced case officer interventions, linking applications to identified skill shortages in the economy, and the assessment of a customer’s current skills and education attainment.  I have no proposals to make further changes to the BTEA eligibility criteria at this time.

These increases were necessary to protect the yield from CGT in the context of the rebalancing of the public finances. An increase in the taxation of capital is preferable from the point of view of its impact on the economy as compared to an increase in employment taxes such as income tax. In these various circumstances, any reliefs introduced over recent years have had to be targeted and time-bound. A CGT relief was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2012 to incentivise the purchase of property between 7 December 2011 and the end of 2013 with the intention of stimulating activity in the property market. The incentive was subsequently extended to property purchased to the end of 2014. I stated recently that this relief will not be extended further as it has served its purpose. The incentive applies to industrial, farmland, commercial and residential (buy-to-let) property (land and buildings) purchased to the end of this year. If the property is held for more than 7 years, the capital gains attributable to those 7 years will be exempt from CGT on a proportionate basis relative to the period of ownership. Property sold within the 7 year period subsequent to purchase will not qualify for relief. Relief for farm restructuring was introduced in Finance Act 2013 on disposals of farm land for the purpose of farm restructuring or consolidation. The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes. Section 45 of Finance (No 2) Act of 2013 provides for a CGT relief for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets made on or after 1 January 2010 in certain chargeable business assets. Commencement of the legislative provisions is subject to EU state-aid approval. Discussions with the EU Commission about State Aid clearance are ongoing. I hope that these will result in a positive outcome in the near future. Notwithstanding that the legislative provisions have yet to be commenced, the CGT relief will only apply, among other conditions, where new chargeable business assets acquired after 1 January 2014  and up to end- December 2018 are disposed of having been held for a minimum period of 3 years after acquisition in that period. I am not in a position to say what the level of investment generated or jobs created by these reliefs will be as, among other reasons, individuals or companies who avail of them are not required to provide that information to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners. As regards the numbers who will benefit and the cost, the reliefs will be claimed through the tax system under self-assessment. The various reliefs which I have outlined are not long introduced. Moreover, in the case of the property incentive relief, individuals must hold on to any property acquired for a minimum of 7 years in order to claim the relief while the CGT entrepreneur relief has yet to be commenced and qualifying assets under that relief must be held for a minimum of 3 years.

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. Currently, 4,326 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA. Mount Trenchard accommodation centre in Foynes, Co. Limerick first opened in March 2005 with a capacity for 100 persons. This was in response to a rapid rise in the number of persons requiring accommodation. At that time, there were over 8,000 persons residing in RIA accommodation. Within a number of months, that number declined to just over 4,800. This decline was mostly attributable to the revised arrangements applicable to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born children born in the State before 1 January, 2005 - more commonly known as the IBC/05 Scheme. RIA is a demand led organisation and must match as closely as possible its capacity requirements in line with the ebb and flow of those requiring accommodation. The fall in numbers being accommodated meant a concomitant closure of a number of accommodation centres, of which Mount Trenchard was one. When the numbers of persons requiring accommodation began to increase again in mid to late 2006, it was necessary for RIA to increase its accommodation capacity. Mount Trenchard was one of five centres that opened in early 2007 to accommodate this increase and it now has a capacity for 55 persons. I am advised by RIA that the continued operation of Mount Trenchard is, along with every other centre, kept constantly under review.

It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.

A comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. In recent years the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda Síochána also now have an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons. At an operational level, An Garda Síochána pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources. In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols. In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations. However, it should be noted that many knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement. In relation to the investigation of specific knife-related crimes, I am assured that all appropriate resources, including any necessary technical and forensic facilities are employed by An Garda Síochána to secure detections and identify perpetrators of these crimes. In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda Síochána are involved in a number of awareness measures relating to knife crime, and I understand that the Garda Schools Programme is utilised to include talks on knives and other weapons for secondary school pupils, emphasising the dangers involved and the need for care, vigilance and social responsibility.

Separately, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is preparing proposals for consideration by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs regarding the reform of Guardian ad Litem services in proceedings arising under the Child Care Act 1991. The issue of Garda vetting of Guardians ad Litem will be reviewed in this context.

In that regard, the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK, in respect of certain road traffic offences, came into effect from 28 January 2010. There is of course close cooperation between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI on a wide range of policing matters, including road traffic enforcement.

Considerable progress has been achieved to date, including the publication of the Inter-Departmental Group’s Report on the 16th July and the announcement that Judge Yvonne Murphy will Chair this independent statutory investigation. Discussions are being advanced with my Government colleagues and the Attorney General with a view to finalising our deliberations on the terms of reference in early course. It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government as quickly as possible setting out the proposed Terms of Reference and to return to the Houses with a draft order to establish the Commission. Given the breadth and complexity of the issues involved, as evidenced from the Inter-Departmental Group's report, it is clear that precise terms of reference are required to ensure the Commission is set up on the most sound footing possible. The investigation needs to be broad enough and inclusive enough to give us an understanding of the issues but precise enough to facilitate completion in a timely and cost effective way. More generally, our approach should have regard to the facts established through recent inquiries into related institutions, and the general experience gained in conducting similar investigations into matters of public importance. Establishing an investigation which is capable of delivering on public expectations and effectively addressing these important matters in a sensitive and timely manner must be our primary concern. This is a complex task and, at this critical stage in the process to establish a Commission, it is appropriate to take the necessary time for detailed consultation and drafting. I am planning to have further engagement with a number of stakeholders in the coming weeks in order to update them on the emerging issues and to seek their further views as matters progress. To do otherwise would not be in the best interests of the mothers and children most concerned or serve the wider public interest.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	390	My Department commissioned the Centre for Effective Services (CES) to undertake a review of the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy, 2001 to establish the extent that the strategy has been successful and to identify any blockages or challenges to its implementation. The report found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless. It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities. Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified. Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties. These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18th birthday. Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living. The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need. Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis. The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them. The Agency and officials of the DCYA have been and continue to explore these matters further with the relevant Departments and agencies, on a bi-lateral basis, to continue to support the improvement of aftercare for this vulnerable cohort. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1 April, considered the draft aftercare provisions. The Committee’s report on the Bill was made available to the Department in mid-July and is currently under consideration, prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.
