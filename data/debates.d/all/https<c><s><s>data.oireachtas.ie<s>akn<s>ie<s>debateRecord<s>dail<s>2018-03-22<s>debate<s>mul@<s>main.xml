            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Dara Calleary</b> asked the <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b> his views on the content of the report on pay equalisation as specified in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017; the actions he will take from the report; his plans for process to pay and equalisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">The Minister published the report on examining remaining salary scale issues in respect of post-January 2011 recruits last Friday. My party sought that report as part of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill. Can the Minister outline what he intends to do with that report? A statement from his Department indicated that there is a process, as we are aware, involving the Public Service Pay Commission but it is important that he would also have discussions with the unions about it.</p>

            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">As part of the negotiations last year leading to the public service stability agreement all parties acknowledged "issues of concern relating to the increased length of salary scale for post 2011” new entrants and committed to examining these issues within 12 months of the commencement of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> In general the issues of concern relate to the insertion of two lower salary points at the bottom of the existing salary scales. We started examining these issues with the parties as soon as the agreement was ratified last October. At that point we agreed with staff representatives that a data gathering and analysis exercise to determine the individuals and grades effected was a necessary first step in examining the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Subsequent to that an amendment to section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act required me to submit a report on these matters within three months, which I did last week. The report was laid before the Oireachtas. It shows there has been strong recruitment since 2011 to the estimated 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with more than 60,500 new entrants hired or just under one fifth of the public service. This includes more than 16,000 teachers, 5,000 special needs assistants and almost 10,000 nurses. In reality, that figure would be even higher as the numbers who joined and left the entry grades during the past seven years are excluded. </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Importantly, it also quantifies the cost of a two-point adjustment as approximately €200 million and the potential benefit to the individual as €3,301 on average. It should be noted that these costs are not included in the €887 million ring-fenced for the implementation of the public service stability agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> It is intended that the report will provide the evidence base for further engagement over the coming months between the parties to explore how the matter can be addressed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">The Minister has continually referred to strong recruitment and the figures he presented suggest that, but among all the people who have been recruited there is a growing sense of injustice at the pay gap but more starkly at what will be the career gap by the time they come to the end of their service compared to those who were employed pre-2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> We have focused a good deal on teachers in this discussion but I want to focus on the nursing sector. As part of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's submission to the Public Service Pay Commission in 2017, it highlighted that 78% of the undergraduate nurses who are doing degree courses in our fantastic colleges around the country, the majority of whom are 23 or younger, are considering leaving Ireland on qualification. It further highlighted that the top three incentives that would entice graduates to stay were pay increases, improved staffing levels and working conditions, and access to funded postgraduate education.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> We are educating these people and sending them abroad to places, such as Australia, where they are getting starting salaries of twice what we are offering here. We are taking that pool of talent away from our health service and meanwhile we are long-fingering negotiations to try to resolve that.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> As I said, pay is not the only issue. Of those who participated in a survey, and who had completed their internship here, the majority of them were not offered permanent contracts until July of the year, at which stage they had been offered jobs abroad. Therefore, there are other issues in question but pay is the issue that is the causing the most division within our public service at present. We need to act on it urgently to stop a flight of graduates from the service.</p>

          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">On overall public service pay, we are discussing an agreement, which, as of the start of this week, all unions and representative bodies are now party to or associated with. The Deputy has raised concerns with me regarding public service pay but I would suggest to the House that we now have an agreement in place that over the next three years looks to increase public service pay by approximately 2% per year. This agreement has been accepted and ratified by the majority of our unions and all unions are either party to or associated with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> On the specific points the Deputy put to me, first, on shifting the debate beyond teachers, that is what this report does. It looks at the impact of this issue on the entirety of our public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">On the Deputy's point regarding Australia, it will always be difficult for us to compete with jurisdictions that are paying twice or more what we are paying, but we can point to other things that our country offers that make it a very good place to work in.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">I accept that there are pay increases. Yesterday the NHS announced a very specific pay increase of 6.5% for people in its service. This will obliterate the increases that are on offer here in terms of attractiveness. We need to act on this urgently. There is a growing sense of anger across the public service, including, teachers, nurses and staff in Houses of the Oireachtas, in regard to this pay difference. We cannot afford to lose these people or to allow that anger to go unaddressed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I understand that the report has been published but will there be an opportunity to debate it? As a former teacher I know first-hand that morale is low among teaching staff. As pointed out by Deputy Calleary, morale is low across the public service. I believe we should have a right in this House to debate this report and I ask that the Minister give us an opportunity to do so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_7" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">It is a matter for the Business Committee if the House wishes to debate this report. In recent weeks, another report produced by an Oireachtas committee was debated in this House. If the Business Committee wishes to provide for a debate on this report, it is open to it to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> On the NHS and the 6.5% increase mentioned by Deputy Calleary, the agreement that we have is between 6% and 7%, with the majority of the benefit focused on new entrants and those at the lower end of the income scale. If the Deputy is suggesting that we should do more for a particular grade or group of workers within our public service, the issue that then arises is how we do that while remaining consistent with the maintenance of a collective wage agreement. I know from hearing the Deputy speak on this matter very knowledgeably over a number of years that he appreciates the need for a collective wage agreement and the need to maintain it.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">One of the main objectives of the sale of the national lottery licence in 2014 for a 20-year period was to generate upfront proceeds for the State. Proceeds of €405 million from the sale were used to fund a range of expenditure projects and served to reduce the need for further tax increases at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Under the terms of the current licence for the national lottery, which was agreed in February 2014, clause 6.9.2 provides that any expired unclaimed prizes shall be forfeited in favour of the licensee, provided that such expired unclaimed prizes shall be used solely for the promotion of the national lottery and-or the lottery games in a manner determined by the licensee, which shall include the funding of special draws and additional or top-up prizes and may include incremental marketing and advertising of the national lottery or such other activities to promote the national lottery and-or lottery games as specifically agreed in writing with the regulator from time to time and no later than within 365 days from the day on which they were forfeited in favour of the licensee. This change in policy regarding the treatment of expired unclaimed prizes is not having a detrimental effect on lottery sales and prizes and, consequently, revenue for good causes.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Under the current licence, national lottery sales increased by 13% in 2016, the last year for which we have audited accounts.  This is leading to an increase in prizes and funds for good causes. Prizes have increased by 11%, from €381 million in 2015 to €422 million in 2016 and funds for good causes have increased by 13.5%, from €193 million in 2015 to €219 million in 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">There is a regulator in place to oversee the operation of the licence and other matters. The Deputy is correct that the regulator of the national lottery did write to Deputy Pearse Doherty stating that under the terms of the agreement it is not in a position to release the information to the Deputy because it is commercially sensitive. That said, a considerable amount of money is being made available for good causes, in respect of which I provided some figures in my initial reply. For example, in 2014, €178 million was released for good causes. This figure now stands at €227 million, such that the figure has increased to a considerable level.</p>

Many people are currently being forced to retire. What is the timeline for the legislation and does the Minister have any plans to deal with those people due to retire between the timeframe of the announcement and the enactment of the legislation? I have a case which I want to bring to the Minister's attention which is typical of a lot of cases in the public service.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_24" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_39">As the Deputy is aware, on 5 December the Government agreed that the compulsory retirement age of public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 would be increased to 70. This is the only group of public servants who currently have a compulsory retirement age of less than 70. Primary legislation is required for the change approved by Government to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The Government has approved, on my proposal, the general scheme of the Bill to give effect to its decision to increase the compulsory retirement age for most public servants recruited before 1 April 2004. I have asked the Attorney General to prioritise the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The drafting process is under way and an initial draft of the Bill is being prepared. The Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the spring-summer session of this year. It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for it to be drafted and passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, given the scheduling requirements and composition of the House. However, it is being treated as a priority and it is my intention to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> The new compulsory retirement age will not come into effect until the necessary legislation is commenced. In the meantime, the Government has approved some limited interim arrangements to apply in the intervening period between the Government decision and the commencement of the necessary legislation. The interim arrangements which have to respect the current statutory position on the compulsory retirement age of 65 years, through retirement and rehire, allow affected public servants who reach the age of 65 years during that period to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State contributory pension, which is currently 66 years. Details of the interim measures have been put in place by relevant sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I wish to outline the impact of some of the interim measures. A colleague of mine has been contacted by a clerical officer who will be forced to retire this year. The person concerned will then be rehired at the age of 65 years in the manner in which the Minister has announced. He will be paid at the lowest point of the scale, plus a portion of the annual pension entitlement, strictly for one year only, to bridge the gap to the State pension. For him, this represents a cut in salary of approximately €11,000 per year. The portion of his pension that he will receive will not bring him anywhere near his current salary. He will be expected to do the same job and carry the same level of responsibility owing to the fact that we are having difficulty in passing the required legislation. Others may not be able to do so because of the delay in passing the Bill. I again ask the Minister to look at the limited arrangements in place. It is not fair that somebody facing that kind of cut will be expected to continue to do the same job because of a birthday.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">If I had not put interim measures in place, members of the public service who wanted to avail of this option would not have been in a position to do so under any circumstance. We have the interim measures in place because I felt it was necessary to have some lead-in time between announcing that we were going to do this and bringing forward a Bill to give people time to arrange their affairs and make decisions on whether they wanted to continue to work. I introduced the interim measures cognisant of the fact that people might quickly decide that they wanted to work further and I wanted to allow them to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The provisions for people commencing work on the minimum point on the salary scale ensure we will stand by and implement the principle of abatement. Otherwise, we would find ourselves in a situation where people might continue to work but the aggregate figure of what they would get in maintaining their salary plus their pension would deliver a sum that was very high. This all comes from my desire to allow people to avail of this option before the legislation is passed.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">The EU fiscal rules have been designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth. While the economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still high and we have to be careful owing to the potential of roll-over risk should interest rates increase. This is a small and very open economy in a world which now has more risk than is usual. Therefore, meeting the fiscal rules underpins our objective of being careful with the national finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The issue of facilitating greater flexibility within the application of the fiscal rules has received a significant focus at European level and framed discussions on the establishment of structural and investment clauses which were codified by the European Commission in November 2015. Specifically, the provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions. Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, there is existing flexibility within the expenditure benchmark whereby capital increases are smoothed over four years, with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded from the first year within the fiscal space. This provision which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within EU rules and has been availed of in our plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The Deputy should also be aware that any decision to increase capital expenditure over and above already planned levels would need to balance the danger of potential overheating in the economy with the need to address infrastructural priorities and risks such as Brexit. As the Deputy will know and as demonstrated by our recent experience in the early years of the last decade, pro-cyclical budgetary policy can jeopardise future living standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I recognise that the updated capital programme is an improvement and to be welcomed. The smoothing of capital increases over four years is something of which we have availed and also welcome. However, we need greater flexibility, given that the capital budgets in the most progressive economies are 4% of GDP. We are not going to reach a figure of 4% of GNI* until 2025. Therefore, we have catching up to do. The Committee on Budgetary Oversight made some proposals in a report it issued. One was that there be an increase in the four-year smoothing period, while another concerned a relaxation of the fiscal rules for capital projects co-funded by the European Investment Bank. Has the Minister raised any of these issues with the European Union? He said at the committee that he would discuss the matter with it to see whether we could avail of other mechanisms which he outlined in his initial response.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I have not discussed the specific report to which the Deputy referred with the European Commission, but I have raised with it the need to make sure the fiscal rules facilitate appropriate levels of public capital investment in those things which will allow the economy to grow in a sustainable way. Within the fiscal rules as structured, the plan we launched, Ireland 2040, looks to provide for a very significant increase in capital expenditure year by year. The Deputy will find that by 2021 the figure for capital expenditure will be 3.8% of national income. Year by year, there will be increases in capital expenditure of at least €700 million per year. We have to ensure that as we increase expenditure at that rate we will have the capacity within the economy to translate it into investment at prices we can afford.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">That is welcome. I refer to the report of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on capital investment. I am sure the Minister is well aware of it as it makes a number of recommendations that he may consider raising at the next opportunity available to him, given where we are and need to get to. It is welcome that there has been an increase in capital spending which we will continue to see increase up to 2025. We are so far behind other progressive economies that any help we can get is welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">Since the Minister has not raised those issues, is it something he would consider doing in addition to what he has already raised with the Commission and is hoping to secure?</p>

I will have to read the report and consider it before I decide what I will raise with the Commission. Currently, my focus is on ensuring that the significant increases in capital expenditure we are implementing at present happen and that the projects we are committed to are delivered at affordable prices. However, I will read the report the Deputy mentioned. I have not had the opportunity to consider it yet. When I have done so I will see if there are areas within it which I might raise with the Commission. I am due to appear before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in a number of weeks and during that meeting I will give the Deputy an update on my view on the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">The public private partnership, PPP, model is an internationally recognised model to design, build, finance, operate and maintain public infrastructure. In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Under the terms of such contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium’s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State. Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project is an unfortunate development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of how the project is procured. The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project the provisions of the contract ensure that the public interest is protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> It is worth bearing in mind that this is not the first time a PPP in Ireland has experienced issues with its construction contractor, which is not uncommon given the risks inherent in the construction market. In all previous similar cases, the projects were completed successfully and are now fully operational. These examples demonstrate the resilience of the PPP contractual structure and underline the importance of adhering to the contractual documentation in resolving issues, which has previously been raised as a negative feature associated with PPPs.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">The Minister's party appears to have a strong preference for the PPP model over the traditional public service model of direct procurement or, indeed, the public service undertaking the actions itself. One of the companies concerned, the Capita group, has responsibility for a significant amount of housing to be brought forward in the Dublin area through three different projects. Given the absolutely tortuous failure of the Government in the current period to provide housing at a reasonable speed and cost, these projects are not delivering. The fact that the company is in difficulty means that assurance of delivery and so forth is even less reliable than it would have been at the outset.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">The Deputy's party displayed an unbridled enthusiasm for PPPs when it was in government. In fact, the largest quantity of PPPs was implemented under the party's current leader. Whatever views the Deputy has now are very different from what was displayed when Deputy Howlin was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> With regard to the Deputy's question on how we complete projects, difficulties with projects such as these are very unfortunate but they can occur regardless of the procurement process for the projects. Where difficulty occurs the payments the State is required to make to the people who are involved in delivering the project will not be made until the State is satisfied that the project is completed to the standard required.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> As regards the schools, a number of meetings took place during February about the schools with the school principals. The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, participated in all those meetings. The latest position on the contractual negotiations is that the Dutch Infrastructure Fund is now in the process of finalising its rectification plan, which I hope will deal with the matters the Deputy raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I ask the Minister to give us more information, perhaps by way of a further written note. Both the Minister and I represent Dublin constituencies and we are both familiar with the housing situation. Having the provision of 1,500 houses in the Dublin area slowed down is basically holing the housing programme below the waterline with a huge hole. This is the difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> The Minister implied, wrongly, that my colleague, Deputy Howlin, was avid for PPPs. The reason is that in that era, as the Minister knows well, the Government could not raise tuppence anywhere because we inherited a situation in 2011 where our credit had been destroyed and the Government was constrained by the troika, under an agreement with the previous Government, to very difficult terms and conditions. However, we are in a different era now. We have financial capacity. I do not understand why the Minister is not looking at both the good elements potentially of PPPs and particularly many of their disastrous features.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I have a technical question. The Minister said that if there is difficulty with one of the funders of a PPP there is no exposure to the State. Are there indirect costs that could accrue? For example, if there is a slow down in the construction of housing is there a cost to the State if it is paying housing supports and in the case of schools if it is renting prefabs? Is that an indirect cost that could accrue to the State or is that factored into the risk and the insurance policies?</p>

            <p eId="para_68">I will reply to Deputy O'Brien's questions first. There is an indirect cost to the State if a project is being delivered through a PPP or another procurement strategy and the project does not happen and people are in alternative accommodation being paid for by the State. The Deputy is correct. That is the case whether it is a school or a house.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> Regarding my approach to PPPs, I agree with Deputy Burton that the context in which we have to evaluate PPPs has now changed. It has changed because the rate at which the State can borrow money is very different and, most fundamentally, we can borrow money in a way we could not between 2011 and 2014. That is why my approach to PPPs is very much on a case-by-case basis. I will evaluate them against the traditional approach of the State building the project directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">We will decide if it is the right approach to take on a project-by-project and case-by-case basis because these are also fundamentally negotiations. In the next couple of weeks I will make available my overall review of PPP policy, which will develop the point I have just made.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">I welcome the fact the Minister's Department has indicated it will review the question of public private partnerships, PPPs. We had PPPs during the years of collapse, and certainly in the years from 2011 to 2014, because it was one of the few ways of borrowing money for desperately needed infrastructure in this country and of keeping the economy afloat, because we could not borrow. However, things have changed. The cost of borrowing for the State is very cheap. I do not understand why the Minister has decided to remove the cap of 10% in the national development plan for 2040. The previous Government, of which the Minister and I were both members, had a cap of 10%. Why has he removed it? Does he mean to allow PPPs to go to 50% or 60% of public construction?</p>

            <p eId="para_73">An interdepartmental agency group was established in 2017 to review Ireland's experience of PPPs and to make recommendations on their future role in the context of the new ten-year national development plan, NDP. The NDP summarises the key findings and recommendations agreed as part of the PPP review, the detailed report of which will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> One of the recommendations of the review, included in the NDP, is that consideration of PPP as a procurement option should be assessed on a level playing field with the traditional procurement option.  In this context, the cap on PPP costs of 10% of the aggregate Exchequer capital allocation in any particular year is to be discontinued in favour of reintroducing the original budgetary control mechanism for PPPs. This approach was also recommended by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in the public investment management assessment, PIMA, report for Ireland published last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Following this review, and in light of the very substantial new public capital investment programme contained in the NDP, it is now recommended that the original budgetary control mechanism for PPPs should be reapplied.  This requires that the capital value of PPPs over the construction period should be charged to the Exchequer capital allocation of the sponsoring Department so that PPPs and traditionally procured projects are treated equally when determining which procurement option to adopt. In other words, Departments will only use PPPs when they offer value for money over traditional procurement.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">I wonder if the Minister or his Department have had the chance to read the Parliamentary Budget Office's overview of public private partnerships in Ireland. What it says about value for money is very clear. The value for money of PPPs is difficult to assess until the PPP itself has been in place for several years. We know this from the example of some toll roads where the private sector is paid for cars that have never used the road.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> Secondly, PPPs can potentially create private sector monopolies. Their duration is frequently a matter of decades, which is the case in the Irish model. In certain circumstances this can provide the private sector with a monopolistic position which may place potential competitors, including from the public sector, at a disadvantage. Where the PPPs relate to the provision of a service it may be very difficult to define the quality of the service. We know this from hundreds of cases in the UK. The cost has been horrendous.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">To answer the question that Deputy Burton put to me a moment ago on the report of the Parliamentary Budget Office and its point about PPPs, I note that one can make that point about any large public capital investment. It takes many years to determine whether it has delivered its objectives and provides value for money. To reiterate the point I made a moment ago, I now see PPPs in a different context. The context is as Deputy Burton has described. We should go ahead with them when they make sense, if the State decides that the money can be sourced more effectively and cheaply than if it was to pay for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">As a matter of record, the priority question that I submitted to the Minister was in fact about the national development plan but guess what? His Department refused it, and it was posted to the Taoiseach. Perhaps the Minister will check this. As a consequence, I wondered which element of the national development plan I could ask this Minister about. He accepted the question I thought would be acceptable but he refused a question on the national development plan. I have a letter from the Ceann Comhairle, which I can send to the Minister's office if he likes. I know he probably got the same letter, but he may not have seen it himself. This is like a little debating society. However, the fact is that there are horrendous stories from around the world about the downsides of PPPs. The upsides are that they can provide more capital room and be a source of capital at a time of need, as was the case in this country.</p>

To answer the questions Deputies Burton and Jonathan O'Brien have put to me, I am aware of concerns about PPPs that have developed in other jurisdictions. In Ireland, there is a track record of many PPPs delivering important projects and at good value. As I have reiterated on a number of occasions, the context has changed. We have to evaluate them on a project-by-project basis. If it is more affordable and effective for the State to borrow the money or to pay for it out of our tax revenues and deliver it through a traditional procurement process, that is what we will do. Having PPPs available introduces a constructive tension into how we price projects. In response to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, it is my intention in the future to publish more information about PPPs than we have in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">The River Slaney flood relief scheme is being progressed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, in conjunction with Wexford County Council. The scheme has been provided for in the OPW multi-annual capital expenditure budgets, and is one of the major schemes financed under the national development plan for the period from 2018 to 2027.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Consultants Mott MacDonald are leading on the design of the flood defences element, with Roughan O’Donovan Consulting Engineers commissioned to design the proposed new road bridge. The existing Seamus Rafter Bridge is a contributing factor to flooding in Enniscorthy and must be removed to ensure the success of the scheme. A replacement road bridge will be constructed just downstream of the town, crossing over the existing playground, and a new pedestrian bridge will be constructed in the area of the Seamus Rafter Bridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> Initial site investigations have been completed, along with archaeological and ecological assessments and reports. An advance programme to control and eradicate invasive species of vegetation is under way. Following the identification of these invasive species within the site in 2015, a detailed survey was carried out to ascertain the full extent of the problem and to enable a management plan and treatment programme to be put in place. Treatment, which involves the controlled application of an approved herbicide, was carried out in 2016 and 2017. During 2018, the treatment of Japanese knotweed will take place in April and September and the treatment of Himalayan balsam will be carried out in July this year. Further advance construction elements which involve relocation of services and utilities along the promenade are expected to commence in 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> The scheme design and environmental impact assessment report and other relevant reports will be made available to the public through the statutory exhibition process. Following this, submissions received will be assessed and designs may be amended as a result. Subsequently, formal confirmation or approval for the scheme will be sought from the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, with construction expected to start in mid to late 2019.</p>

Following two years of delays, I question the Government's commitment to deliver this much-anticipated flood relief scheme for Enniscorthy. I received a reply to a recent parliamentary question which stated that a public information event about the proposed works was now scheduled for this summer. This is nearly two years behind schedule. The Government had said it would hold a public display in 2016, then it was to be the third quarter of 2017 and then it was the first quarter of 2018. Construction was originally due to commence in 2017 and is now delayed until the first quarter of 2019 at the earliest, according to the most recent answer. For almost two years the Government has rescheduled the public information events. These delays are completely unacceptable. I understand there is significant demand for flood relief schemes in the State and I am very concerned that Enniscorthy is going to lose out on funding if there are any further delays on this.</p>

It takes quite a considerable amount of time. This is working with the local authorities and the relevant bodies and, most importantly, the people in the areas. Deputy Browne is aware that I recently visited Enniscorthy and saw the issues at first hand. I met the county manager, the director of services and the people on the ground to see and sense exactly what the issues are around the flooding in Enniscorthy. As late as last week when I was in Kenya, I was in contact with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, due to the threat to the people in Enniscorthy in this regard. I am fully aware of the delay that took place with the scheme, but I am also aware of the pace at which I am moving to get this scheme up.

I am quite happy that it is going to happen. I praise the county council staff and the emergency services who have done tremendous work during the crisis when Ireland experienced severe snow. They had barely got back to their beds before they had to get up again to deal with potential flooding of the town by the river, which was within millimetres of bursting its banks. Thankfully it did not, but it needs to progress as quickly as possible. I thank the Acting Chair, Deputy Eugene Murphy, who has also brought this matter up. This has been let slip for two years and it cannot be allowed to slip any further. Enniscorthy is very vulnerable to flooding. It has caused regular crises for local businesses and homes as a result. It causes a huge amount of distress and damage to the economy of the town. We need to see the scheme progressed quickly. I have heard comments about it being prioritised. I fail to see how anything is being prioritised when it is already two years behind schedule.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 33 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> I was delighted to visit the Hill of Tara recently at the request of public representatives in the area to inspect at first hand the various issues which affect the site and to listen to the various comments on the need for improved facilities there. The Office of Public Works, OPW, has responsibility for the management and maintenance of the site and operates a seasonal guide service based at the former Church of Ireland building. It also provides maintenance services and manages both the national monument structures and the extensive acreage of the Tara site. This is clearly a most important historical centre which is popular with many visitors both domestic and foreign. Safeguarding it is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> The various agencies involved are engaged in the preparation of a new management plan for the site and its future will be set out clearly within that. The OPW is participating in that work and is clearly focused to ensure that its responsibilities are addressed. An extensive process of consultation is under way which will, I have no doubt, inform the best future plan for perhaps the most important archaeological site on this island.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I am not entirely sure if the Minister of State or the officials or the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are aware of what the Hill of Tara actually is. It was the seat of the high kings of Ireland in ancient times. It is the most important historical and cultural site in the State. Despite this the Minister of State's Department does not provide car parking or toilet facilities for visitors. As far as I can see, the Department does not contact the local authority except when the Minister of State is on a visit for a meeting organised by one of his own colleague councillors. The Department does nothing for the Hill of Tara except cause aggro with local residents. The local residents have a number of groups, including the Rathfeigh, Skryne and Tara community centre. There was a meeting organised recently by them. The Friends of Tara have also campaigned for some time to get proper facilities. I believe they would be happy if the Minister of State agreed to meet the two groups of residents and all six councillors in the area, some of whom live a lot closer to Tara than the councillor I am glad the Minister visited. The Minister of State needs to meet the groups with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and with Meath County Council. Nobody is in charge in this regard. Technically the site is owned by the OPW, but nobody seems willing to take leadership. I appeal to the Minister to take leadership on this issue and to meet the groups, with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and with Meath County Council, to see where we can go from here in providing facilities and a proper management plan for the Hill of Tara, and working in conjunction with the local residents.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I will first point out to the Deputy that I was in the area looking at flooding issues and I was asked if I would go to the Hill of Tara. I am aware first-hand of what our heritage stands for. I was the first one to give free admission to heritage sites to children under 12. This brought in 47,000 children to visit all our heritage sites. This year I introduced free admission for people with disabilities and their carers to all heritage sites. The Deputy does not have to lecture me on what I do not know. I visit most of our heritage sites, whether I tell the public representatives or not. I want to see the issues first hand to see if I can address them.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> I agree with Deputy Byrne that there is a bit more work to be done with regard to the Hill of Tara. I have met the local authority and it has outlined the issues. This group has been set up in relation to those findings. We should wait for the outcome of that management plan. The Deputy has never made representations to me on the Hill of Tara. If he had, I would have taken up the issue. Deputy Byrne has tabled his questions today and I am dealing with them, but as soon as the report comes, we will have that discussion.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">I should not have to make representations to the Minister of State and to the OPW about the Hill of Tara. My colleagues on Meath County Council have been pleading with the OPW to do something with the Hill of Tara and this has been going on for a long number of years. It is all right putting on this show that Boxer will get the job done, but we want this primary seat of architectural and cultural heritage to be minded by the OPW. The Minister of State has been in office for less than one year but this issue has been going on for a long time. It is about time somebody got a handle on it. The residents' patience is wearing thin because there have been so many promises.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">In the last days of the Fianna Fáil-led Government we had the landscape heritage plan, which came from the Green Party and which caused uproar among the residents. Things then seemed to stall for years, and people are now demanding action. Basic facilities must be provided by the OPW, such as toilet facilities and car parking. Those facilities are actually provided by local people, and the OPW seems to be getting away with that at the moment. I am pleading that this matter be treated seriously and that the Minister of State meets the residents. He should work with them, and I will work with him. He should do that in conjunction with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. We do not need a plan to decide that we need basic facilities for tourists, visitors and local people coming to the Hill of Tara.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">The public services card, and its online counterpart MyGovID, is the Government’s standard personal identity verification scheme, and it is core to delivering public services to people in a secure and efficient manner. My Department works closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which is the lead implementation body for the production of the PSC, MyGovID, and the SAFE registration process which underpins both.</p>
            <p eId="para_122"> The SAFE registration process used to establish and verify a person’s identity, increases the privacy protection and security afforded to people by ensuring that the person using a service is the person they claim to be, and by minimising the requirement for people to provide the same identity information over and over again. The use of the card and MyGovID to establish identity with a high level of assurance is fundamental to providing people and the public service a means to protect their data.</p>
            <p eId="para_123"> As the data controller for data collected during the SAFE registration process, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is committed to ensuring that data relating to people are securely held and used only for relevant business purposes. Its commitment to safeguarding data is reflected in the use of advanced data processing and storage technology, hosting in secure data centres and is reinforced by a range of legislative and administrative provisions that are designed to protect the rights and interests of citizens. They impose obligations in relation to the confidentiality, unauthorised access, unnecessary use, alteration, destruction or disclosure. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has worked with my Department to publish a Comprehensive Guide To SAFE Registration and The Public Services Card last October, which is available online. Further information, including a detailed set of questions and answers, relating to the card and MyGovID is available on the website <i>psc.gov.ie</i>. </p>

In 2018, access to more public services will be underpinned by the PSC and MyGovID. Details of this plan can be found within the eGovernment Strategy 2017-2020, published in July 2017.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I was the Minister responsible for introducing the public services card. Ireland spends about €20 billion a year on social welfare payments to people. The public services card has enabled a much better quality of service, with greater speed and effectiveness. This applies particularly to the free travel enjoyed by pensioners and the disabled. People can now do their business with a far greater degree of privacy and confidence than was the case before the card was introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> I am raising this question because I am really concerned that what has been a very significant achievement of the public service in Ireland, together with the development of the Intreo services and offices, where people can go and do their business with privacy and make appointments, etc., is being put at risk by the failure of this Government. In particular, I refer to some of the comments made by the current Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, in which she spoke of compulsory and mandatory use of the card. The Government is raising a fear that data are not secure, and people are entitled to be assured that they are secure and properly regulated by law. There is mission creep in relation to the proposal for driving licence applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">I want to reiterate to the House that we have the highest level of protection in place to ensure that citizens' information and private data are safe, secure and stored and regulated in accordance with data protection law. I am aware of the issues of concern that were raised in the second half of last year. That is why we have published the document I referred to a moment ago on the website of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. It explains to citizens how we are handling the various issues of concern. We have responded, and will continue to respond, to any matters of public concern and any observations or views that the Data Protection Commissioner may have.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">In this strategic communications, spin-driven Government the Minister would be well advised to rethink what is happening reputationally to the public services card. It is extremely important to people who are using it, particularly our pensioners for their travelling needs, and others who are using it for a range of services. It is particularly important in terms of the €20 billion that is disbursed annually through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> An awful mess has been made of the proposal around the driving licence. The Minister has not explained to people what the advantage of doing this is, and he has not set out what the advantage could potentially be for people. Instead he has raised fears at a time when people are very alert to what companies such as Cambridge Analytica have been doing with their private data. It is on the record here, but given the emphasis this Government places on communications, the Minister has not communicated adequately to ordinary people that their data are secure, safe and private. They give their data to the Government for the purpose of Government transactions with them, and they are not to be used in any other context.</p>

At a time when there are such legitimate concerns about how we protect our digital identity and make sure information that people share is securely protected I would have thought that the rationale for the public services card has actually grown rather than been diminished.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 14, 15 and 17 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> Ireland has been a significant beneficiary of Structural Funds throughout the 45 years of our EU membership. Of particular significance in the context of Brexit is the financial support there has been for the Border region of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with almost €2.4 billion of EU funding having been provided for successive PEACE and INTERREG programmes. The current programmes have a combined value of €550 million in the period 2014 to 2020, of which 85% is being funded through the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.</p>
            <p eId="para_147"> The Government is firmly committed to the successful implementation of the current programmes, but more than that, we are committed to successor programmes post-2020. The PEACE and INTERREG programmes are important drivers of regional development in a cross-Border context. Through EU-funded co-operation, a range of Departments and agencies, North and South, have engaged in and benefited from a variety of cross-Border and cross-community projects. Support for the two programmes from the ERDF is not only an important source of funding but also a key element of the European Union's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation in the region in the last quarter of a century. I was delighted, therefore, when December's agreed progress report between the European Union and the United Kingdom included a specific paragraph which reflected the Government's ambition to complete the current programmes and examine favourably the possibilities for future programmes.

            <p eId="para_149">Will the Minister say what plans have been made to improve the investments in ports, particularly Dublin, Rosslare and Cork, over and beyond what is contained in the Ireland 2040 document? Notwithstanding all of the publicity around it, the document does not really explain in detail what the proposals are. Post-Brexit, we must have far more direct transportation links between Ireland and the European mainland because, no matter what happens, there will be problems at French ports, in travellling through England, as has been the tradition, and we do not know how the Border issue will be resolved and where, in effect, the Border will be. I accept that the European Union has shown goodwill towards Ireland in this respect, but we need to have it backed up by serious funding to improve our capacity to have direct shipments to mainland Europe, rather than have shipments via the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p eId="para_150">I thank the Minister for his response. There are four priority areas within the PEACE programme which has been narrowed. They are shared education services for children and young people, shared spaces and services and building positive relations. As the Minister will be aware, PEACE programme funding has played a crucial role in the Six Counties and Border regions. In the light of Brexit, would it be feasible to broaden the range of projects included in the PEACE programme? There should be more priority areas covered by the programme. I would be grateful if the Minister looked into that matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">I was going to say something similar. The European Commission will examine favourably future programmes and has committed to the continuation of existing programmes. While we are in the early days of discussions on the next round of the EU Cohesion Fund policy, we should be bringing forward concrete proposals to the Commission for additional programmes or areas to be covered. I wonder what ideas the Minister has in that regard or whether he will feed into the discussions. Particularly in the light of the scenario post-Brexit, it is important that we start that round of discussions as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">The way the questions were grouped probably did not do justice to Deputy Joan Burton's question about the general application of EU funds, with particular reference to ports. Our colleagues asked questions about PEACE and INTERREG programmes funding. They relate to different matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_153"> To respond to the first question Deputy Joan Burton put to me about a focus on ports, the Ireland 2040 plan, in the section on connectivity, places a lot of attention on ports and how important they will be post-Brexit. In terms of from where funding will come to allow their development, it will come in one of two ways. Most of it will come from the resources available to ports, but, obviously, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport now has a five-year capital allocation to support important capital projects. Within the five-year window additional support could be made available to make progress on really important projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_154"> To respond to the questions put to me by Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and Carol Nolan on whether it is feasible to broaden the current range of priorities for funding, it is unlikely to happen because we have agreed to the projects and the funding stream for the current European Union programmes. We had to place a lot of attention on making sure the commitments we had made would be implemented. That was a real priority of mine in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum result. It is unlikely that we will change the breadth of programmes or projects at this point. Where I am placing the majority of the focus of my Department is on what will take place. Regrettably, what we are looking at are equivalent programmes in what are referred to as "third countries" to see how or whether they offer a precedent for the development of programmes post-2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">Has the Minister had discussions with the European Commission on additional allocations of funds for Ireland? Obviously, the status of Ireland, given its economic growth rate, etc., has changed. Nonetheless, Brexit will pose an enormous economic challenge to the country and also mean that access to our markets via the United Kingdom may no longer be as easy as it once was. We are hoping for the best, but, to be honest, we must plan for a situation where there may be far more direct trade involving a longer sea voyage and which may involve not using the United Kingdom to the same degree. Frankly, we know from scenes in places such as Calais that where large numbers of trucks roll off ferries, one needs very significant port infrastructure, much bigger than what is in place. I wonder whether the Minister has had conversations with the European Union on how we will manage. I could put similar questions about airports, but, to be honest, initially the most difficult part will probably involve ports.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">Another way to deal with it would be to broaden the priority areas within the PEACE programme to ensure that they are adapting to the new conditions that will be imposed on communities under Brexit. We need additional PEACE funding and programmes to meet the challenges in those communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">We have our work cut out for us to maintain what we have agreed. Considerable effort had to go into ensuring that the commitments made up to 2020 were met. It would be of great help to our efforts if the institutions of Northern Ireland were in place to assist us in this work. We are working directly with the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, which oversees the implementation of these programmes, to ensure that commitments we have are met. Our focus now has to be on whether when the UK leaves the EU these programmes will be maintained and if so where the money will come from to maintain them and what structures it will flow through. This is a very big question. I am committed, as I have said on several occasions, to coming up with a way in which we can maintain our commitment to these programmes because I have seen at first hand their valuable effect and would be very concerned if that work was not to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_159"> In response to Deputy Burton, yes I have had discussions with the Commission about the kind of support Ireland may need as the UK leaves the EU. The nature of the support that we may need will depend on the form of the UK's exit. That is a matter of intense negotiation at the moment. It is one of the reasons I welcome the fact that we have a transition period in place to give more time for resolving and understanding these exceptionally serious matters. </p>

            <p eId="para_162">The shocking record figures for people on trolleys over recent weeks were further evidence of an unacceptable crisis in the health service. Once again, nurses, doctors and medical experts said we need more beds and to have those we need more nurses. We also need more teachers. The Government cannot recruit them because it is not paying them properly and one of the problems is that new entrants are paid less.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">As already discussed, I submitted a report examining the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post 2011 new entrants on Friday last. While I have outlined the proposed next steps on foot of the report, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of the findings in that report. The Deputy asks about low pay and whether this is resulting in staff shortages, particularly in health and education. It seems to be popular in some quarters to assert that the public service no longer represents an attractive career option, that there is a crisis in recruitment and a continuing focus on the difficulties within the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_164"> My concern is that much of this can be counterproductive. The truth is that the public service is a good employer by any objective measurement. Public service offers a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, flexible working arrangements, decent pension provisions, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment. While public service is a career choice, and people who serve are highly motivated by the public good, the competitiveness of the package on offer can be seen in the strong level of recruitment that this report has highlighted. </p>
            <p eId="para_165"> Headline public service numbers already show a high level of recruitment of over 29,000 since 2013. However, this is the growth in the overall public service and as such it does not capture recruitment "below the line", replacing retirements and leavers. </p>
            <p eId="para_166"> The report I submitted last Friday, however, sheds light on this, revealing that over 60,500 people have been recruited in the "new entrant" grades since 2011. This represents almost a fifth of the current public service including over 16,000 teachers, 5,000 special needs assistants and almost 10,000 nurses.</p>

            <p eId="para_167">The problem is that in many cases, and certainly in nursing, as many nurses are leaving as are being recruited. I had a long conversation with Phil Ní Sheaghdha of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, last week who pointed out that in 2016 the State recruited 2,573 nurses but 2,271 left in the same period. The net recruitment for the health service where there is a dire capacity problem and we need thousands more nurses, is a tiny few more. She pointed out that in 2008 someone at point 1 on the staff nurse scale got €31,875 a year. Today, almost ten years later, that person gets €28,768, almost €3,000 less when accommodation costs have gone through the roof. Someone at point 5 earned €38,000 in 2008 but today earns €34,000. Is it any wonder we cannot recruit the nurses - I have not even begun to discuss the teachers – if their wages are less than they were ten years ago and the cost of living has gone through the roof?</p>

            <p eId="para_168">What the Deputy does not take account of is the fact that there have been significant increases in recruitment, including in frontline services since 2011. He referred to a recruitment crisis. I point to the fact that over 60,000 more public servants have been recruited.</p>
            <p eId="para_169"> In response to his concerns about salary levels and retention he does not take account of the fact that we are in the early part of a new three-year collective agreement. I remember when the Deputy challenged me in the House to say collective agreements would be undermined, that it would be very difficult to maintain them in the future. As of this week there is a collective agreement for three years that virtually all unions or representative bodies in this country are either in or associated with. That agreement is in place to deliver wage growth for our public servants. That is why the Public Service Pay Commission is specifically inquiring into nursing and will report in the summer. </p>

            <p eId="para_170">Some unions signed up to those agreements because they thought they were the best they could get but they are not happy about it. Many unions did not sign up to those agreements because they consider it completely unacceptable to have a pay apartheid whereby people who happen to be recruited after 2011 and 2012, and who over the course of their lifetime will earn maybe €100,000 less than somebody doing exactly the same job just because they happen to be recruited afterwards. That is the difference between being able to buy a house and not. Nurses, teachers and others working in the public service are part of the housing crisis, whereas decades ago, in the 1970s, a teacher or a nurse could at least hope to get a mortgage and buy a house. Is it any wonder that there is a capacity problem in the health service and we are having difficulty getting teachers? The Minister can quote all the figures he likes but there are shortages. That is why the Government cannot open the beds. The Minister for Health has acknowledged this. </p>

            <p eId="para_174">However, when I put facts to the Deputy he dismisses them if they do not fit into his narrative. We recognise the contribution our public servants have made and the concerns that exist, in particular in regard to our health service where we now have a specific module of work under way. The Public Service Pay Commission will report during the summer. In respect of hospital beds, I have accepted the capacity report on acute hospital bed provision published by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, some weeks ago. It lays out the need for an additional 2,300 hospital beds within our public service. We will make progress across the coming budgets in delivering those additional beds.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I start by commending and acknowledging the bravery, professionalism and efficiency of the Dublin Fire Brigade members who dealt with the fire in the Metro Hotel in Ballymun last night. Many of them are still onsite this morning. The dangerous and rapid fire was dealt with by eight units of the fire brigade. The fire started in one of the apartments on the top floor. Units from Finglas, Swords, Tara Street, North Strand, Blanchardstown, Phibsborough and Tallaght were in attendance with over 60 firefighters fighting what could have been a serious blaze.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> All of us are grateful and thankful that no one was killed or injured. It shows the fantastic work Dublin Fire Brigade and its firefighters do as well as those from the stations in Skerries and Balbriggan, the retained firefighters, who were brought in to provide cover. We will return to this issue because lessons will need to be learned from this, in particular in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. Today is not the day to raise those issues but I and my party colleagues will be putting questions to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> This morning I raise the question of passports which I have raised on a number of occasions. I refer to the service our citizens are receiving. Last year, as the Tánaiste will know, over 800,000 passports were issued. That was a record. I think all of us expect that will be exceeded this year. That is coming at a price. The increase in passport application numbers is affecting the service the paying public is receiving. I commend the work of the staff in the passport service. However, the reality is that turnaround times have greatly lengthened. The passport service website says 16 working days but it is not. It is 21 working days and longer.</p>

That is a 16% increase on the same period last year, and not in the holiday period itself. Normally, temporary staff are employed to tackle the increased demand and the number of applications and we have discussed this before. However, the Government has not dealt with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I refer to the increase year round and from Brexit, in particular. There seems to be a detached approach. The Government seems to be satisfied to allow the applicants to wait longer than the normal 15 day turnaround time. Does the Tánaiste accept that these delays in the normal turnaround time are now the norm? Why is the Government not planning to deal with increased demand by increasing staff numbers for the year round increased demand in the passport service?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">I join with my colleagues on both sides of this House in thanking the emergency responders who responded to a significant and extensive fire in the Metro Hotel and apartment building in Ballymun last night. There were 11 units of Dublin Fire Brigade, eight fire engines, two aerial appliances and the incident command unit, comprising 60 firefighters, involved in managing that blaze. The professionalism that resulted in the evacuation of 150 people from the building and no loss of life should be recognised in this House. Nobody was injured-----</p>

          <p eId="para_195">-----but it could have been a very different and tragic scene. However, it was not. That is a reflection on the professionalism of our emergency services and first responders. Today, the Garda Síochána has the scene cordoned off. There will be an extensive investigation to understand what happened. As Deputy Darragh O'Brien has done, I thank those involved for their professionalism. We will come back to this issue when we have more clarity on what happened and on why and how it unfolded.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> On the passports issue, the service has been under pressure, in particular over the last two weeks. A number of Members know that because they have come to me about individual cases. We have tried to put extra resources into my office over the last number of weeks to try to deal with that. We anticipate increased numbers this year on last year in respect of passport applications and renewals. Last year there was a big increase on the year before. There is a big demand for Irish passports now. The real problem in recent weeks was actually the extreme weather.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> We had to close services down because staff could not get into the passport office for a number of days. As a result, our passport teams worked over the bank holiday when other people were not working in an effort to try to catch up and get back to the turnaround times we created last year which were a significant improvement on the past. Whether it is online or post applications, we are endeavouring, with some success, to get back to where we were in January and the back end of last year in respect of getting turnaround times down to roughly three weeks for the postal service and two weeks for an online application.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> However, that is taking some time. This week online applications are back to the acceptable benchmark. We are working overtime to make sure we get back to that from a postal service perspective as well. However, people have to understand that many services in the country have been impacted by severe weather and this is one of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">With all due respect, that is a non-answer. We know bad weather events and Storm Emma occurred. It shows that the system is not robust. If the reason given for the backlog and people waiting five or six weeks for passport renewals is Storm Emma, that is not true. The reality is that resourcing within the service has been decreased year-on-year. In 2012, there were 306 full-time staff in the service. In 2016, there were 269. There was a 12% reduction. I asked the Tánaiste specifically if he has plans to increase the number of staff in the service to deal with the backlog? We are nowhere near it.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The website says 16 days for a renewal but it is not 16 days. I encourage people to use the online renewal service as well. However, first-time applicants and under 18s cannot do so. People are missing trips, holidays, business trips and big events because the resources are not there. Saying it is down to the weather is not really acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">I commend the speedy response and bravery of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade in dealing with last night's hotel fire in Ballymun. It is thanks to them, the Garda and other emergency and council staff, as well as the staff of the hotel and the adjoining building, that there were neither injuries nor fatalities. They deserve all of our thanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> This day two months ago, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced his affordable homes initiative. Describing the measures as initiatives was a bit of a stretch. They were more like threadbare promises. He re-announced the €25 million fund for local authorities to deliver affordable homes but there were no details, no timelines and certainly no targets. He re-announced the long-promised but not yet delivered cost rental project. Again, there were no details, no timelines and certainly no targets. The only concrete proposal was for a revised local authority first-time buyer's loan scheme. Clearly, the Minister was under pressure. He needed to give the impression that he was doing something. That was because on Fine Gael's watch, the affordable housing crisis has spiralled out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of individuals and couples are unable to access affordable homes to rent or to buy. The Government's housing plan has no targets for the delivery of affordable homes. The Minister, possibly with the overpriced advice of the strategic communications unit, cobbled together the so-called initiative to make it look like he had a plan. In response to the revised council loan scheme, Sinn Féin raised the following concerns. It did not address the core problem, namely, the undersupply of affordable housing. It risked burdening modest-income families with unsustainable loans to purchase overpriced houses. It breached the Central Bank's mortgage lending rules. While the scheme will help some families and the fixed-interest rate is attractive, it demonstrates the Government has not yet grasped the scale, or indeed the source, of the affordable housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> When I made these points at the time, the Minister dismissed my concerns. However, this morning, RTÉ reporter, Louise Byrne, revealed on "Morning Ireland" that the Department of Finance shared exactly the same concerns. In a written response to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance said the rationale for the measure was unclear, it involved significant risk of exposure to the State and would do nothing to increase housing supply at a time when supply not demand was the problem. Despite this, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, ignored these concerns. The information obtained by RTÉ also revealed that, even though its concerns were not met, the Department of Finance withdrew its objections, leading to speculation that the final decision was a political one, made in full knowledge of the shortcomings and problems with the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Will the Tánaiste tell the House why the Government ignored the opinion of the Department of Finance? Will he tell us why Rebuilding Ireland contains no targets for affordable rental or purchase homes? Will he confirm that not a single affordable home will be delivered this year by any central government scheme?</p>

          <p eId="para_227">The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme was a measure which was discussed between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Finance, as any scheme would be when significant moneys are involved. In this case it was a €200 million fund and, of course, there was back and forth, questioning its merits. The truth is that at the end of that discussion, the two Departments agreed to move forward with it. That is what the record shows. Is anybody who has been in government surprised by the fact that initially the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would raise robust questions to test the merits of this approach? There is always a robust exchange when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a new idea and asks it what it thinks. At the end of that, there is an agreement on a way forward which is what happened in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> It is a success story so far. It has been only launched several months and we get weekly reports about the level of interest in it. Last week, there were 323 calls, of which 319 were answered. There is a significant interest as one would expect in Dublin. Up to 26% of the calls received were from Dublin and 16% from Cork.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I understand why the Tánaiste is so sensitive on this issue because Rebuilding Ireland was his plan. He signed off on a document which contained not a single target over its six years for a single purchase for a rental affordable unit. As everybody knows, phone calls will not solve the affordable housing crisis. Affordable homes will.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I will ask the question again. How many affordable homes will be delivered this year funded through central government schemes? We know the answer, which is why he would not give it. It is zero.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The real issue is that all the measures, which the Tánaiste and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government continually repeat, will not deliver homes at genuinely affordable prices, namely, between €170,000 and €225,000. That is real affordability. Will the Tánaiste not finally accept that the measures which the Government is funding, at great cost to the taxpayer, are not delivering affordable homes? Will he agree the time has come to fund local authorities in an ambitious programme to deliver genuinely affordable rental and purchase homes on public land?</p>

          <p eId="para_271">On behalf of the Labour Party, I, too, commend the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade for their efficient, speedy and life saving response to the fire in Ballymun last night. There will be an opportunity for us to look in detail at the lessons to be learned about evacuation procedures and so on, but they worked well last night and nobody was injured or died, which is an incredible tribute to the emergency services. It is important the House acknowledges that.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> There was a landmark decision yesterday at the Workplace Relations Commission when the national broadcaster, RTÉ, was found to have discriminated against a former employee, Ms Valerie Cox, on age grounds and ordered to pay her €50,000. The reason she took the case was concerns about ageism in employment. As people, thankfully, are living longer and healthier lives, many will want to look work longer. The age of retirement in qualification for the State pension has risen to 66 years and will rise again. However, many employment contracts provide for compulsory retirement when a person reaches the age of 65 years, as a consequence of which many older people will find themselves on temporary or uncertain contracts if they continue to work after that age. We have seen the creeping rise in the level of precarious work and it is essential that it be tackled for all workers in order that older workers who wish to continue to work beyond the age of 65 years will not be exploited. We will see more and more such cases. My former colleague Anne Ferris introduced a Bill in the Dáil in 2014 to bring to an end the compulsory retirement age in the public service. The Government is catching up and plans to address the issue with legislation, the heads of which were approved in December. There are many working in the public sector who, for many reasons, do not wish to retire at 65 years and who are more than capable of continuing to be valuable public servants and make a contribution for years to come. The public service is growing and recruiting again and important institutional knowledge should be retained. It will provide important benefits for our society as the population ages if older people can continue, if they so choose and it their wish, to work. It is important to stress that it would be voluntary. The legislation should be progressed as quickly as possible to provide certainty for those workers who are approaching the compulsory retirement age. Many are anxious and contacting all of us in the House. The current arrangements which are being implemented on an interim <i>ad hoc</i> basis, pending the passage of legislation, are neither attractive nor rewarding. I have two questions. When will the Government publish the legislation to abolish the mandatory retirement age for public sector workers? Will the legislation also end the use of compulsory or mandatory retirement provisions in the contract of workers?</p>

          <p eId="para_273">Like the Deputy, I welcome the judgment of the Workplace Relations Commission and hope it sends a signal to the many people who find themselves in similar circumstances to Ms Valerie Cox. As the Deputy noted, the Government has agreed to increase the compulsory retirement age from 65 years to 70 for public servants who were recruited before 1 April 2004. It has also approved the scheme of a Bill to give effect to this policy change which is now to be treated as a priority. The Attorney General has requested the prioritising of the drafting of the legislation in order that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible. The drafting process is under way and an initial draft Bill is being prepared. The Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the spring-summer session. It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for it to be drafted and passed through both Houses, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, as the Deputy noted, the Government has approved interim arrangements which will apply to public servants who reach the age of 65 years in the time between the Government decision and the commencement of the necessary legislation. I accept that is not ideal. People have come to me, as I suspect they have to the Deputy, who are coming up to the age threshold. We need to get on and deal with the legislation quickly. We appeal to other parties in the House to help us to do this quickly. It is a priority to turn what is a clear policy decision, with which I think everybody agrees, into legislation to bring clarity in order that people will not have to rely on what are not perfect interim measures but which are necessary to carry us over until the legislation is concluded.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I thank the Tánaiste for the clarity of his response. It is a view that is shared broadly across the House. Sinn Féin has also introduced legislation in this area, which I acknowledge. In truth, there are people who will miss the deadline and be forced out. Can we not have consensus that the legislation will be introduced this side of the summer recess and implemented with goodwill across the House? The Workplace Relations Commission has published a code of practice on the issue of longer working which is to inform best practice for employers. However, a code of practice is not enough; it will need legislative underpinning. Certainly, for those who are anxious, for example, those who might be in second relationships, have longer term mortgages or financial commitments about which they are very anxious, and capable of working for many years to come, they should not be forced out the door. I dealt recently with one case in which a driving instructor simply wanted to continue to work. Although there is a huge backlog and we are still trying to recruit and train driving instructors, he was forced out the door. That policy makes no sense. It should not be mandatory for the State and its agencies to push people out the door when they want to continue to work and are capable of working and the State needs their services.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">We all know former civil servants in their late 60s who would be well capable of doing a really good job, but we are losing their expertise, knowledge and experience at a time when there is competition for skill sets in the economy and it is sometimes difficult to fill posts with persons with the skill sets we need. This is the right thing to do on many levels. It arises in a context where people want to work longer and have the capacity to do so, are healthy for longer and the State needs their services. In so many areas, because we can afford to do so, we are increasing numbers in the public sector. My Department is a good example in that we are dramatically increasing numbers in expanding our global footprint, opening new embassies and so on. We want people to stay longer and need to get legislation in place as quickly as possible to underpin that decision. I will reflect this commitment at the Cabinet meeting next week and we will try to accelerate it as quickly as we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">I concur with previous speakers in commending the emergency services for tackling the fire in Ballymun which, thankfully, did not lead to a loss of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> I will speak about elder care or, I should say, the complete lack of it throughout the country, including the constituency I represent, Cork South-West. The elderly built this country. Now, when they need help from the State, they have to fight every inch of the way to receive care. Proof of this is the way the Government stands idly by as hundreds of the elderly are forced to travel to Belfast for cataract operations. For them, it is simply a case of travel Belfast or go blind. That is just one issue. Elder care services needs to be scrutinised by all of us in the Dáil. Years of empty promises have yielded nothing. The home help service being delivered is as bad as it was two years ago when I first raised the issue with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who said the Government would turn things around. Home helps go beyond the call of duty, but the joy they get from their jobs is diminishing quickly as visits are cut to 30 and 45 minutes, which means that they are in and out the door, thus preventing them from providing the necessary care and giving the eldery person the attention and respect he or she deserves. In many cases, home helps who have voluntarily done hours of extra work for the person receiving the service are being refused extra hours by the HSE, while it funds many private companies with questionable guidelines which have taken on staff from all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">In the programme for Government, it was recognised that home help should be increased to seven days per week to include weekends and bank holidays where possible. According to what families have been telling me, though, that is not the reality in my constituency. Many elderly people have been forced into long-term care and put through the so-called fair deal scheme, which robs them of their savings, homes and, in many cases, burial money.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> More than 55,000 people have been diagnosed with dementia, 4,000 of whom are in County Cork. Many of these are looked after in their own homes by members of their families. There are a number of Alzheimer's patients whose behaviour is challenging, but neither the community hospitals nor nursing homes have the staffing or resources to provide respite care for them, leaving exhausted families to care for them. There are only two dedicated respite beds for these challenging patients in the entirety of west Cork, those being in Clonakilty Community Hospital, which can largely only service the Clonakilty area. West Cork has the largest elderly population, as shown in the census statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I call on the Tánaiste to set in motion immediately a study to provide extra respite beds in community hospitals and nursing homes across west Cork for patients with dementia. I also call on him to instruct the HSE to start investing proper resources in the excellent home help service that is in place on the ground and whose carers have saved the State millions of euro over the years with little thanks. He should examine the issue of the respite service for the elderly in west Cork, which has been non-existent in many cases. Elderly care in west Cork leaves much to be desired.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">There were a lot of questions there, so let me try to revert with answers on some of them. The Deputy has raised the cataracts issue with me in the House previously. I am sure that he has raised it with the Taoiseach as well. The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is about trying to get operations done for people - maybe not locally, but certainly on this island - to ensure that we can deal with backlogs. The February NTPF figure confirms that the number of patients waiting for inpatient or day case procedures is down 1,165-----</p>

          <p eId="para_283">-----from the previous month and 4,764 from the same period last year. It is taking effect and making a difference. It is having an impact on procedures, with which we are familiar. Between July 2017 and the end of last year, there was a reduction of more than 2,000 people waiting for cataract appointments, 200 fewer people waiting for hip operations and a series of other improvements in terms of knees, tonsils, gall bladders and so on. We are not claiming that the job is done, but significant progress is being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Budget 2018 allocated an additional €18 million to home support services. The additional resources have brought the resources for the direct provision of home support services to €408 million, delivering more than 17 million home support hours to approximately 50,000 people, many of them in west Cork. This is an increase on last year's figure. In addition, 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs, some of whom are also in west Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> I hear what the Deputy is saying on behalf of his constituents but, now that we can afford to spend significantly more money, we as a Government are responding by way of home help, home care, increasing the carer's allowance and pensions, and a series of other measures through which we are respecting and supporting elderly people living at home. However, it takes time to make significant differences, particularly in terms of waiting lists and putting localised services in place that people can access. In the meantime, considerable progress has been made through the NTPF.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. He mentioned numbers dropping, but they are dropping because people are going to Belfast as quickly as they can for operations that should be carried out locally. He also referred to cataract operations. Those should be taking place in Bantry, Mallow and elsewhere in west Cork. They are 20 minute procedures. The Government has failed in its duty to look after our elderly. It will let them go blind before it will look after them.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> The Tánaiste stated that money was being invested in elder care, but I question that. The simplest way of approaching this is by speaking to those who need that care. I will outline a sample of the crisis that we are experiencing in west Cork. Last night, I spoke to someone from the Bandon-Kinsale area, one of whose parents was suffering severe dementia. She has been trying in recent weeks to get long-term care for her loved one, but no beds are available. In Skibbereen, another person who is desperately seeking respite care for a family member with dementia has been unable to do so, as community hospitals are not equipped to take such patients. An elderly lady who looks after two elderly family members in their homes in Skibbereen and Bantry needs extra home help for just one day per week to go shopping, but she has been refused it. The stunning new Bandon Community Hospital opened just a few short weeks ago, but while those essential works were under way for up to a year and a half, the family of a lady of 90 years of age could not get respite care. Now her family members hear that there were 12 to 14 beds available in Clonakilty Community Hospital that are currently being designated as step-down beds.</p>

In the meantime, most in the House would accept that, while people are not getting locally some of the complex operations they need, they are able to access those operations under the NTPF instead of staying on waiting lists for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> This is a process of incremental improvement year-on-year as the Government spends more and insists on better management and more efficiency to ensure that, regardless of whether people live on the Beara Peninsula or in Dublin city centre, they can access the services they need, especially if they are elderly persons who need the State's support through health care facilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">I wish to ask about the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, which has been described in today's editorial in <i>The Irish Times </i>as the pet project of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. I concur with that view. As the Tánaiste knows, Fianna Fáil is opposed to the Bill because it is fundamentally flawed, but if the Government is not going to listen to us, we are not the only ones who have concerns with it. The European Commission has expressed its concern that the Bill "would not be in line with European standards". The Tánaiste will agree that this comment is not insignificant. It cannot and should not be ignored. Is the Government concerned about the Commission's view and, in order that Ireland can meet the highest standards of judicial independence, will it reconsider this legislation, which is being driven by the Minister, Deputy Ross?</p>

There is still no certainty on how the backstop, with which I will not deal today, will function, or legal clarity in advance of the European Council. It has been reported that each Department has been instructed by the Government to prepare contingency plans and emergency legislation to deal with a hard Brexit. Has that been done? Will the Government publish the contingency plans and the heads of legislation being prepared in each Department to deal with a hard Brexit?</p>

We must make a judgment call on what is helpful to be put in the public domain and what will contribute to a negotiating strategy for Ireland. I will happily tease through the issues in more detail at the stakeholders' forum or elsewhere with Members, if they so wish. We have published a series of over 20 reports. There is, therefore, no shortage of information available to the public. We must consider the details of the internal preparations being made by the Government because we have only just received the feedback from Departments and more work must be carried out by some Departments in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">My question relates to the commitments in the programme for Government in respect of health care, to which the Tánaiste referred. There is a wonderful institution, St. Theresa's Hospital, in Clogheen, County Tipperary. A local committee and families whose loved ones died in the hospital have raised almost €500,000 and the Health Service Executive, HSE, is to contribute €400,000 or €500,000. However, we cannot get to have meetings or engagement with the HSE. The project has been left hanging for three years and different designs have been brought over and back. The hospital has an excellent staff and matron and is widely used by people from across County Tipperary and west Waterford.

          <p eId="para_316">On page 127 of the programme for Government it is stated the Government will fund additional capacity to meet existing and future commuter needs. I remind the House that the Taoiseach was very keen to tell everybody that he had been responsible for Luas cross city, but he has not been seen during the chaos that has arisen since. The problems include timetable failures, chronic and dangerous overcrowding, the impact on commerce and a significant impact on journey times for Luas and Dublin Bus passengers, pedestrians and cyclists. Some 10,000 Dublin Bus passengers are discommoded daily as a result of route changes and electronic failures which resulted in the withdrawal of longer trams. The solution has been to take seven trams from the red line which serves the south side of the city and my constituency and transfer them for use on the green line. Can the Tánaiste guarantee the people of Tallaght, Belgard, Fettercairn, Citywest and other place on the south side of the city that there is adequate capacity on the red line to meet commuter demands, particularly at peak times? Does he accept that replacing trams on the green line with trams from the red line is not an acceptable solution to the capacity problem on the green line?</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I refer to page 108 of the programme for Government. Lyme disease is the world's fastest growing vector-borne infection. People all over the country, many of whom are radically debilitated and incapacitated as a result, are suffering from it. According to experts, some GPs have a poor level of awareness of the disease and its symptoms, as a result of which the disease is overlooked and misdiagnosed. Many have been left in limbo in terms of its diagnosis and treatment and forced to take on a large debt in order to travel to Germany to receive treatment.

          <p eId="para_327">As regards the commitment in the programme for Government to rural and coastal community sustainability, I refer to the fishing sector, with particular reference to landings made by foreign trawlers in Irish ports. I have been told that the figure for total landings in Castletownbere, in the Tánaiste's county, in 2016 came to €111,000,000, of which 65% or €72,150,000 was accounted for by foreign trawlers. Up to 15 articulated lorries consistently collect fish on a weekly basis to take it out of our jurisdiction to be processed elsewhere. Can anything be done about the added value that would accrue from the construction of a processing plant? Such a plant would be of great benefit to local coastal communities such as Castletownbere, Dingle and others that are suffering.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">The agreement made in principle this week on a transition period of almost two years after Britain leaves the European Union has provided reassurance for fishermen in Ireland that their access to United Kingdom waters under the Common Fisheries Policy will not diminish or change during that period. That is very welcome as there was much concern in the fishing community in that regard. We will have to wait and see what will happen after the transition period. That issue will very much form part of the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> As regards landings made at Irish ports by foreign and Irish vessels, it is important to point out that Irish boats also operate in the sovereign waters of other countries. Approximately 30% of our mackerel is caught in British sovereign territory off the north coast of Scotland. The point about the Common Fisheries Policy is that fleets move within EU waters and there is a mechanism that allows us to set quotas. Therefore, it is not necessarily a bad thing that foreign boats choose to land fish at Irish ports. They could steam elsewhere and land fish at other ports. The key is that we try to ensure Irish boats have the maximum number of fish available for them to catch in a sustainable way.</p>

The response from the staff at the hotel and in the tower in evacuating the building was, equally, truly heroic. For many years, our fire services have requested additional equipment to tackle high-rise buildings, such as extension ladders, power hoses and other vital equipment, as well as training and recruitment. What is the status of the reappraisal of fire safety in the wake of the devastating Grenfell Tower fire in London, as announced by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in June 2017?</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I am sure the Tánaiste is well aware that the country is sleepwalking into a crisis in terms of the provision of front-line community medical care through our GPs. Some 10% of the approximately 2,400 GPs practising around the country are due to retire in the next two years, with 30% due to retire within the next seven years. In County Limerick, we have 46 GPs and almost a quarter are due to retire in the next four years. We are sleepwalking to the edge of a cliff and, if the current situation continues, many parts of the country will not have a GP to provide care in the community. It is a serious situation. The FEMPI cuts, which affect the provision of primary care centres, are a money issue but what is the Government doing to retain GPs in the country and to ramp up the numbers to replace those who are retiring with an average retirement age of approximately 68?</p>

          <p eId="para_339">We are increasing the number of training places for GPs and we are seeing a gradual increase in that area. An engagement involving the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation on general practitioner contractual issues, such as FEMPI, is expected to resume next month. The Minister wants to speak directly to GPs on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Over the past three weeks, I have received numerous calls from farmers in Sligo-Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal who are suffering severe hardship as they try to provide fodder for their stock. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, brought in a scheme to subsidise hay and silage but the hay went up by €8 per bale and the silage by €12 so it was no benefit to farmers at all. It is a health issue for many people and I am calling for farmers to be front-loaded by €1,000 to help them to survive and to feed their families and their stock over the next month. Farmers in the part of the country I come from have been feeding their cattle in these conditions for the past eight months. They will get the money anyway but it would make a lot of difference if they got it now.</p>

It is important that we make provisions for the west of Ireland and there are huge hardships in the constituency we represent so it is vitally important to accommodate the affected farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">This is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. He brought in a fodder transport scheme to respond to the very wet weather. There is enough fodder in Ireland - it is about moving it around and getting it to the farms which need it and that is why transport costs were the focus. If farmers are in extreme circumstances and there are animal welfare consequences of a lack of availability of fodder, they should contact the Department directly. They will get direct help immediately for animal welfare issues linked to fodder.</p>

        <heading>Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) (Amendment) Bill 2018: First Stage<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T12:50:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#JohnBrassil" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Deputy John Brassil<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_360">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_361">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to establish specific criteria applicable for orphan medicinal products for the purposes of the Health Service Executive making a relevant decision regarding adding an item to the Reimbursement List.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and to put in place a structure for the Health Service Executive to appropriately assess orphan medicinal products when making a relevant decision regarding adding an item to the reimbursement list. It will provide clear guidance to the HSE over the appropriate usage of health technology assessment guidelines when assessing an orphan drug as well as establish a new criterion for the HSE to consider when making a relevant decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> The provisions of the Bill are set out under four sections. Section 1 sets out to define the term "orphan medicinal product" while section 2 inserts same into the principal Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The definition used is that set out in Regulation No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> Section 3 amends section 19 of the principal Act. Section 19(5) of the principal Act deals with the HSE's decision-making process in adding medicinal items to the reimbursement list and establishes that the HSE shall have regard to any health technology assessment, HTA, guidelines published by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that appear to the executive to be relevant to the relevant decision. Currently, the HSE does differentiate an orphan medicinal product from other medicines in assessing the cost-effectiveness of a medicine in respect of which reimbursement is sought. Currently, HTA places a heavy emphasis on fixed thresholds on the financial value of the volume and quality of increased life expectancy a treatment provides, in other words, the quality-adjusted life years assessment. Threshold incremental cost-effective ratios disadvantage orphan medicinal products due to the often low availability of quantitative data as, by definition, a rare disease affects only a small number of patients while orphan medicinal products treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases, meaning the improvements in health outcomes will be proportional to the severity of the patient population. Section 3 amends subsection (5) to qualify that for the avoidance of doubt, HIQA guidelines that include a threshold incremental cost-effective ratio or similar assessment shall not be considered relevant when considering an orphan medicinal product for reimbursement.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Section 4 amends section 3 of the principal Act. The principal Act sets out criteria under Schedule 3 against which all medicines must be considered by the HSE when making a relevant reimbursement decision. Part 3 of the Schedule contains several criteria in respect of which orphan medicinal products are particularly unfairly disadvantaged given their typically low patient population profile, high individual cost and low budgetary impact. Accordingly, section 4 establishes a new set of criteria for consideration of orphan medicinal products mitigating against low qualitative data and guaranteeing that the HSE will consider qualitative data presenting on an orphan medicinal product for patients, clinicians and others. Section 4 also aims to tackle inequality of treatment for patients with rare diseases by legislating for consideration of unmet need and for the availability of same treatment elsewhere in the EU. Additionally, section 4 would require the HSE to consider the level of certainty provided via risk sharing commercial agreements with the manufacturer of an orphan medicinal product.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_22">That Dáil Éireann:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">recognises that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_24">— micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises currently employ nearly 970,000 people in Ireland according to the Central Statistics Office, which represents around 44 per cent of all those employed;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25">— the cost of doing business in Ireland has been cited by the National Competitiveness Council as a major concern;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26">— many businesses are reporting large increases in employer and public liability insurance premiums;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27">— the cost of employer liability insurance and public liability insurance is a direct threat to the competitiveness and sustainability of many businesses throughout the country, including micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28">— the greater use of insurance excess and insurance exclusions is increasing the cost of insurance by the back door;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">— without urgent action, insurance premiums will soon become unsustainable for many businesses;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">— as a result, a greater number of businesses will not take out insurance at all and this practice is extremely risky and threatens the viability of the businesses involved;</summary>

            <p eId="para_651">I thank the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise the issue. I have raised it before as a Topical Issue matter and in a huge number of parliamentary questions over a long period.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> The amalgamation of the schools in Kanturk is a long-running issue and has met huge obstacles and difficulties. It is an amalgamation of two fantastic schools - the boys' school and the girls' school in Kanturk. It was first mooted a long time ago when issues such as the procurement of the site, access to the site and planning permissions were considered. There have been many obstacles. I want an outline from the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills on the roadmap as we go forward for the jigsaw involving the local authority, land acquisition, trying to secure planning and the acquisition of the property. At one stage the Department appealed the decision. It was the first time an applicant appealed a decision to the board as a result of issues surrounding it. There is huge frustration with the project within the school community in Kanturk and the wider community there. Many people I meet have given up completely on expecting it to progress. While a flag has been raised that the new school has been sanctioned, the official sanction was given in 2010 or 2011 and it had been sanctioned even before that. It has gone through a very protracted process.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> Will the Minister put the exact process before the Dáil? Where do we go from here? How far away are we from tender documents going out? How far away are we from actually making sure the project will start and go to construction? When does the Department envisage the school will be open for students? Many dates have been given over recent years, which is hugely frustrating for the boards of management and the communities involved. Of all the projects, there have been more representations made by me and other public representatives down through the years to try to get this up and running.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> Now is the time. I understand the money was sanctioned a long time ago but where do we go from here? When do the Department and Minister believe the project will commence? There was no mention of it in any of the capital plan announcements. There is a bit of scepticism about how we go forward. What is the position? When will it go to tender? When do the Minister and his Department believe construction will start? When does the Minister believe the school will be completed for pupils, staff and the entire community of Kanturk to move into the long-awaited new school? We will start with those questions and I may have some supplementary questions for the Minister.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_655">I thank Deputy Moynihan for raising the issue. It is an issue of considerable concern. I have spoken to the Deputy's constituency colleagues, including the Minister, Deputy Creed, and others, who share his frustration. I understand it. It has a very long history. The planning process started way back in 2012 at which point planning permission was refused by Cork County Council on the ground of access. It then came up with an alternative approach to access and alternative site access proposals. They were granted but subject to conditions that, as Deputy Moynihan has said, the Department felt could be leaving them exposed to building a school that would not have adequate access and could not open. Based on the conditions, the Department instructed the Office of Public Works, OPW, to appeal the conditions to An Bord Pleanála but they were upheld so the Department had to proceed. That has added complexity to the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> I understand the project has been delayed in more recent times due to issues concerning clarification of the ownership of the lands adjacent to the site and on a number of sides, the passing of some of that land into county council ownership, and the acquisition of licences that are required to carry out the necessary enabling works for the project. I gather the issue was related to building an access road and footpath which were required due to the new condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> I am pleased to note that the issue around the land passing into county council ownership has been resolved and a licence has been received from the county council to allow the necessary electrical cable enabling works on that land to proceed. This development permitted the OPW to agree a design with the ESB for the works and the OPW is now proceeding to tender for them. I gather that that element of the works could take up to nine months as it involves groundworks and overhead diversion works, all of which must be completed. A further licence from another landowner to allow foul sewer works during the building project has progressed and is now being finalised. That does not hold up the enabling works for the electrical works, which are now proceeding to tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> With the progression of the enabling works my Department will be in a position to approve the pre-qualification of contractors for the project later this year and then to approve the project to proceed to tender and construction. While I fully understand the frustration the Deputy and the various stakeholders in St. Colman's boys' school and the Convent of Mercy girls' school in Kanturk have experienced, we are now in sight of getting all the issues resolved and will be in a position to move to the pre-qualification stage for contractors. I am encouraged by that and I assure the Deputy that my Department is determined to push this project on, given the difficult experience people have had.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_659">The Minister mentioned a period of nine months for the enabling works. Will he clarify the position in that regard because we need certainty on the progress of the project? The Minister indicated in the second last paragraph of his reply that there has been progress in obtaining a further licence from another landowner to allow the foul sewer works during the building project. Has the licence been completely finalised or will there be a delay while we await its completion?</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> Six years ago in 2012, when the project first went to planning permission after the OPW sourced the site, difficult issues arose in terms of site acquisition and dealing with the site. Will the Minister indicate how long the process will take in terms of the enabling works and the appointment of contractors? What is the Department's indicative timeframe? Will the Minister also indicate when the tender documents will be released? I am interested in learning about the genuine timeframe. We do not want to hear deadlines that cannot be met. We want the factual position on when the tender documents will be released in order that people can physically see the project is moving on. Does the Department have a timeframe for completion of the project provided everything goes according to plan?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_661">Deputy Moynihan rightly indicated why the Department does not give firm timelines, because we do not know what might happen during a tender process that was not anticipated. I refer, for example, to issues arising with ground conditions that were not fully anticipated. The Department does not say a project will take a specific period because, as Deputy Moynihan rightly said, people would feel frustrated at the perceived setback. As I understand it, the issue relating to the land is being finalised. That is not to say that it is not impossible that something would go wrong but the Department is fairly confident that that element is agreed and that it will be able to proceed. The tenders are being issued in respect of the ESB works, and on the successful completion of those tenders, it is expected that the work would take six to nine months. Those elements are reasonably predictable, and to prevent a delay, it is our intention to pre-qualify contractors so that we are not holding up that stage with the various enabling works are being done. We are taking an approach that cuts out any unnecessary loops. I assure the Deputy that we will keep a close eye on this to make sure that the difficult experience does not continue to frustrate people, as I well understand has been the case.</p>

            <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_663">I welcome the opportunity to raise my proposal with the Minister. As we all know, public consultation is one of the most important activities both national and local government and State agencies can undertake. By consulting effectively with the citizen and stakeholders we improve on the making of policy and its implementation. It is essential that public consultation is done in a very accurate way as it is so important that we get it right. The consultation process increases transparency and improves engagement with the people. The information gleaned from public consultations means that policy is more informed and accurate and that, if changes are to be made, citizens are more aware of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> In recent years, both locally and nationally, various types of public consultation have been carried out. For example, at local level, when local area plans are being carried out, a local authority must try to communicate with the local citizenry that it will happen and try to reach people in as many ways as possible. A similar process is undertaken for the county development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> Currently, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is doing a consultation on the disability allowance payment and other schemes in terms of whether they should be reconfigured and how. The question is who knows about that. A person might be unaware of the situation unless he or she is a member of an advocacy group. The consultation is taking place on the <i>welfare.ie</i> website and unless a person is affected directly, he or she might not know about it although what that person might have to say is valuable. To participate in a meaningful way, a person would have to make a submission him or herself or have someone do so on his or her behalf. However, the only way that person can make a submission is to know about it in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> My proposal is that for the citizen to understand and access public consultation, we should have a single access portal on the Internet. Each county could have a separate access point showing both local and national consultations. For example, in my area, if I click on County Offaly, I could see what consultations are being carried out by the local authority but I could also see what the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Arts Council or Fáilte Ireland are doing at a national level. Therefore, I could make a submission on a particular issue if I so wished. At the moment I believe reaching the citizen is very piecemeal. Given how technology is moving, it must be possible for us to have a single online portal for public consultation that would allow people to look at their local area, region or nationally and see what is relevant to them. Currently, I do not believe we are getting good quality, all-encompassing information. We must take a targeted approach.</p>

          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_274">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_667">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I agree entirely with her on many of the issues she has raised. Since my appointment to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I have been working on this issue with my officials and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. It is the subject of a commitment given in the programme for Government adopted in May 2016. We have gone a good way down the road in the development of a single point entry portal between the unit in my Department, the open government unit and the Office of the Chief Information Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> I have a prepared answer, but the Deputy will be glad to know that much of the engagement she has suggested has been initiated. I have had engagement with the Acting Chairman and a number of other Deputies on other issues, but if it would be helpful, I would be delighted, if I can, to convene a meeting with the relevant officials and the Deputy at the earliest opportunity to bring her up to speed on the work we have done on the issue. With reference to much of what she referred to, we have gone a good way down the road in looking at it, particularly other models. One of the best examples available to Ireland for how the Government can best communicate with the citizenry through eGovernment, which forms another part of my responsibilities, is available in Estonia. While we are not suggesting we move entirely in that direction, it does give us food for thought.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> The Deputy is absolutely right. It is the advocacy groups and those who claim to be representative of civil society that engage, but the vast majority, including the middle of the road person who gets up in the morning and sends his or her children to school or looks after somebody at home, do not have that level of engagement, unless they are involved in one of the organisations mentioned. It behoves the Government to try to use every mechanism available to us at national and local level to provide the citizenry with an opportunity to hear about what the Government is doing. That is the concept behind having a single entry point portal and making communications for the Government much more streamlined. That is part of the remit I have been given.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> The public consultation portal is being developed by the open government unit in conjunction with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. There was to be a launch of the portal shortly, but I have requested that prior to the launch it be further developed to allow users to receive email notifications and share consultations on social media. I have asked the senior officials to meet to discuss that issue, but I have also asked them to examine an aspect about which I have a concern - the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the carrying out of public consultation. Week in, week out there are very large advertisements - sometimes smaller ones - in national and provincial newspapers about statutory requirements placed by every Department, local authority and so on on public consultation processes that have to be initiated. We could do it much more simply and cost effectively by virtue of State agencies, Departments and other entities being able to log on and make people aware of them. There is, however, the added difficulty of reaching people who do not have access to ICT services. Therefore, there will be a requirement to continue along the traditional route for certain elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> My reply has been circulated and I can go through it later, but the Deputy raised specific issues and I wanted to assure her that we had taken them into consideration. To respond to the points she raised, I would be delighted to facilitate an opportunity for her to sit down with me and my officials to hear about what we have done so far and share her ideas in order that we can move forward in a manner that is in keeping with best practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">I cannot tell the Minister of State how happy his answer has made me because I raised this issue in the previous Dáil with the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who undertook to investigate my idea, but between one thing and another, I did not get back to him to find out what was happening. I would like to think I might have had some input into the proposal coming to fruition. I am delighted about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> I am reassured by what the Minister of State said about not everybody having access to technology, yet it is a wonderful way for us to connect with people. Having consultations accessible on online platforms and linked with the single entry point portal will be very helpful. As a public representative, I like to think I am well informed on different things that are happening, but, as the Minister of State also said, perhaps the only time I realise there is a public consultation process is when I open a newspaper at the weekend.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> I am delighted with the news and will be very happy to take up the Minister of State's offer to avail of an opportunity to make a further input at some point with him and the officials in the Department because this will be a very significant development to enable citizens to have their say, be heard and, importantly, aware when a public consultation process is taking place and we want to hear what they have to say. Policy and cultural changes are sometimes very difficult and it helps to consult citizens along the way to hear what they have to say, perhaps even before the commencement of a public consultation process. It is crucial that we get the process right because we can see the mistakes that were made in the past when the people were not consulted or given adequate information, for which we all paid the price. I sincerely believe this is a marvellous move for democracy.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">My role is one the Taoiseach has defined as Minister of State with responsibility for open government and eGovernment. They are not two different coins but very much the same entity. As I have often relayed to other Members of the House and my officials, we cannot have one without the other. While until now I have been preoccupied in the drafting and completion of legislation on other issues, legislation which is almost ready to be brought before the House, this is an issue about which I feel strongly because consultation is not something that should just be initiated by the Government. It should also be about finding out from citizens their concerns that may not necessarily be on the radar of Members. With the greatest of respect to us, we are all very busy and whether we want to admit it, in some areas we are the captive of the bubble mentality. Every Member is very busy. As a result, our agendas are often driven by those who have access to information, including advocacy and civil society groups. However, they do not include over 90% of the people who are not actively involved in any group and who may not want to attend a constituency clinic or get involved in a political party but who still wants to engage with the Government. The quickest and most effective way to do this is through an online or electronic communications system. There is a difficulty in that regard and the infrastructure to be used in creating it will not be put in place overnight. It comes at a cost which has to be borne by the people. It would be much easier if we had a magic wand in deciding whether I should bring forward a proposal in the House through the Department that would involve a lot of capital investment and that would meet with the support of Members. I am not naive enough to believe that would happen because I know that some people would say it was an awful waste of money on a vanity project to engage in consultation with the people, but this is about investing long term in our democracy when the Government and politicians would be kept way more informed of the views of the people, as opposed to what we are being told by the Fifth Estate.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">I was about to say the Minister was also very proud of his roots. There are plenty of bogs in County Roscommon.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">I cannot overstate the importance of Bord na Móna to County Kildare on many levels. They include the heritage and ecological system of the bog, horticulture and the employment the company has provided in the past eight years. Only last week, at a meeting of Rathangan Tidy Towns committee, we discussed celebrating the heritage and employment benefits delivered by Bord na Móna. People moved from other parts of Ireland to work for the company and settled in places such as Timahoe, Kilberry, Coill Dubh and Allenwood in County Kildare. Their families have become part of the area. </p>
            <p eId="para_680"> The Rathangan poet William A. Byrne has written many poems about the bog, including the following four lines:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_681">I was the broom and crooked heather,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">I was the moss that grew,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_683">But time has moulded us together,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_684">Beneath the years of dew.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">While I accept that Bord na Móna is operating in a challenging environment, we must also ensure the company's long-term viability. Not only is it facing a challenging business environment, it is also in transition. It currently supplies peat to the three power stations in the midlands. I understand the plant in Edenderry has reduced its use of peat by 40% under a carbon neutral initiative while maintaining the same number of jobs, which is crucial.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> Does the Minister support the concept of co-fuelling, an approach that certainly appears to make sense? Does he continue to support a managed transition from peat to other fuels in the period to 2030? Such a transition period will be important because it will give Bord na Móna an opportunity to enter new areas of business. </p>
            <p eId="para_687"> Yesterday evening and this morning we received word that there were to be job losses at Bord na Móna. I understand 45 jobs will be lost in ten locations, including seven in Newbridge and four in Lullymore, both of which are in County Kildare. I invite the Minister to visit the Lullymore Heritage Centre close to the Bord na Móna operation in the area to show him what a wonderful job people in the area have done to celebrate the importance of the bog. </p>
            <p eId="para_688"> To address the more important matter of job losses, it is fine if it suits people to take a redundancy package or leave the company. However, there are many Bord na Móna employees who are not in a position to do so. I call for consultation on the job losses and a commitment to be given to sustain the company's other jobs in County Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> My colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, and I have been calling for funding raised by the carbon tax to be ring-fenced and reinvested in renewable energy technology. This would give Bord na Móna a future and ensure continued sustainable employment in County Kildare and the midlands generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_690">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I will not recite poetry, although I will declare an interest to the extent that I have been eaten out of the bog by midges on many occasions. The village in which I was born is surrounded by bog. Incidentally, I hated every day I spent on the bog.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> Bord na Móna employs approximately 450 people in County Kildare. The company has a long association with the county, which historically centred on peat harvesting operations across bogs in the north and west of the county. Bord na Móna's 450 County Kildare based employees are located at a number of centres, including the company's head office which has been located in Newbridge since 1994. The head office provides the location for most of the group's central support services. It also houses many of its business unit headquarters, including those for the fuels, horticulture and resource recovery businesses. The resource recovery business headquarters also incorporates the call centre for the AES waste collection business. Other significant Bord na Móna centres across the county include the horticulture facility in Kilberry, the resource recovery facility in Drehid and peat harvesting operations across a number of bogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> With the exception of the fuels business, none of these areas is affected by yesterday's decision. It should be noted that the decision does not affect the approximately 120 people who are involved in the manufacture of the company's peat briquettes at Derrinlough, County Offaly. Yesterday's decision by the company to cease operations in its coal business will affect 11 of the 450 employees in County Kildare, of whom seven are located in Newbridge and four at a convenience fuels facility in Lullymore. The company is engaging with the affected employees and will consult them on possible outcomes, including redeployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> Bord na Móna informed employees yesterday of the decision to exit the coal business for a number of commercial and regulatory reasons. As the Deputy will be aware, Bord na Móna is a commercial semi-State company and while operational matters are the responsibility of the board and management team and do not come directly within my area of responsibility or functions, I am nonetheless acutely conscious of the impact of the recent decision on employees of the company. The underlying reasons for the move away from coal form part of the company's transition from its traditional business activities towards a business model that is sustainable in the long term. This includes the coal-firing of the peat-fired power stations in Edenderry, Lanesboro and Shannonbridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> To answer the Deputy's question, I support the company's transition and attended the public consultation days in the parochial hall in Shannonbridge and St. Mary's Hall in Lanesboro, at which we engaged with members of the community and explained what we were planning to do to transition from peat to biomass in the next decade or thereabouts. My priority is to ensure biomass is generated and grown as close as possible to the three peat-fired power stations. The intention is to maintain and, I hope, enhance current employment levels in Bord na Móna. I am acutely conscious of the importance of the employment provided by the company across the midland counties, extending from east County Galway to counties Roscommon, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Kildare. I am determined to put in place a sustainable transition and maintain the maximum possible number of employees in the areas in which the company currently operates. The same types of equipment and skill sets will be used to bring biomass into the peat-fired power stations.</p>

            <p eId="para_695">I am reassured by the Minister's commitment to sustain employment in Bord na Móna. As I noted and he acknowledged, many towns and villages in County Kildare and the midlands owe their development to the company. Many families depend on the continued viability of Bord na Móna. When we consider that the company provides 450 jobs in County Kildare, its contribution to employment in the county is substantial. I know that the Minister shares my concerns in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> This is not the first time the Minister and I have discussed Bord na Móna in the Chamber. Last year I raised with him problems being experienced in Kilberry. At the time he kindly agreed to arrange a meeting with the then chief executive of the company, Mr. Mike Quinn. While a meeting took place, unfortunately, Mr. Quinn did not attend. I understand a new chief executive officer, Mr. Tom Donnellan, will start work on 18 April. I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure a meeting will take place between Mr. Donnellan and Deputies and Senators from the counties impacted on by Bord na Móna. It would be good to have a meeting with Mr. Donnellan early in his tenure to assure him of our support and raise our concerns about individuals in our counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> Will the Minister give a commitment to ring-fence revenues from the carbon tax for investment in renewable energy resources? I thank him for his time and positive response.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">The new chief executive officer, CEO, must come into place and I will have the same conversation with the new CEO that I had with his predecessors. For me it is a priority to maintain job numbers right across the midlands. I have made that crystal clear. As we transition away from fossil fuels into sustainable forms of fuel, it will remain a priority. That is why I was determined as Minister to establish Bord na Móna BioEnergy, which will probably be the biggest employer of staff across the midland counties in the years to come. I am determined to support the management team in developing that sector of the business. I am sure the CEO will not have a difficulty in meeting Oireachtas Members from right across the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> The ring-fencing of carbon tax will have to be dealt with by the Minister for Finance and I am sure it is a matter that can be discussed at the finance committee. The company is focused on progressing its plan to develop a sustainable business model that will maximise the number of people it employs not just in County Kildare but right across the midlands and right into County Roscommon and County Galway. Many of my neighbours are seasonal employees with Bord na Móna and I am very conscious of the impacts in this regard. I believe today is the last day of operation of the briquette plant at Littleton in County Tipperary. I want to see the site being explored for new business opportunities. We must keep that in mind when looking at Bord na Móna and the likes of Moneypoint as they transition from traditional fossil fuels. We should be able to put a clear channel in place to bring about a more sustainable future, with sustainable long-term jobs in the vicinity of those plants. I am determined to try to develop this as long as I am a Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">I congratulate the Dublin Fire Brigade on its bravery, dedication and professionalism in dealing with the major fire at the Metro Hotel at Ballymun last night. It involved 11 units of the Dublin Fire Brigade and 60 firefighters. I also thank the Garda, Dublin City Council and the other first responders on the scene for the work they did. What lessons can be learned from this fire? In particular, what has happened since the horrific Grenfell Tower fire in west London? What area risk assessments have been carried out on high-rise buildings in Dublin and throughout the country since that fire?</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> It is my understanding that many high-rise buildings, including this hotel which is 15 storeys high, apartment blocks and nursing homes etc., have not yet been given an area risk assessment. This is very serious matter. Cladding was an issue with the Grenfell Tower tragedy but we do not yet know what the position is here yet because assessments have not been carried out in many cases. Buildings may not be conforming to regulations and units in buildings may not be self-contained. If that is the case, the advice given to residents to remain in place in buildings is completely wrong, and they should be evacuated from the building.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> There are many grey areas that really need investigation. I understand there was a problem with the lift in the hotel last night, which should also be examined. We need a full investigation into the fire and a full report on the progress of risk assessments of high-rise buildings in Dublin and throughout the country. Dublin Fire Brigade is not getting the resources it needs to do its job effectively and a direct funding mechanism should be put in place for the Dublin Fire Brigade. The Dublin Fire Brigade must be allowed to continue to provide an ambulance service as well, although that matter is separate and I will come back to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">Like others I pay tribute in particular to Dublin Fire Brigade and all the other emergency services, including the Garda and Dublin City Council workers. As a result of their efforts, I am thankful that last night's disastrous fire brought no fatalities and, as far as we know so far, no casualties. I find it ironic that as Dublin Fire Brigade is rightly being showered with congratulations about this, it has had a running battle with the city manager for 15 years that has the aim of basically bringing down the standard of employment of firemen, who are experts in the safety of the people of Dublin and other citizens. It also concerns the proposed disbandment of the ambulance service.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> Many trendy commentators constantly tell us that Dublin must go up and become high-rise and compact. At the same time we know what happened year after year, particularly during the Celtic tiger. There is the saying that doctors bury their mistakes but developers and contractors could also bury their mistakes in not meeting required fire standards. It is the reality. Everybody knows in this city that where people live in high-rises - I am referring to buildings with four to six storeys, never mind what the trendy people in government want for Dublin, which is 12 to 20 storeys - we are not getting full information about levels of fire safety and conditions and risks in building. There is a separate problem that the Minister will have to address. Last year in my constituency there was a disastrous fire in a block on a Saturday afternoon. I am thankful nobody was injured but the residents will now have to pay to bring the rebuilt buildings up to safety standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_705">Last night I witnessed first-hand the devastating effects of a fire in a high-rise building in Ballymun. I also witnessed the courage of the emergency services, the Dublin Fire Brigade, gardaí and Dublin City Council in responding to the fire. We owe them our deepest gratitude for the courage and fortitude they demonstrated last night. The staff in the building should be thanked for the role they played in helping evacuate the almost 200 people in that building. However, we now need answers to a number of important questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> How could a fire spread so quickly from floor to floor and apartment to apartment? How did the fire spread not just to apartments above the source of the fire but also to apartments below the source? Why did the fireproofing methods employed in the building not contain the fire to a better extent? What triggered the fire and how was the alarm raised? Were alarms and smoke detectors working on every floor and was every apartment checked? Is it the case that the fire brigade ladder could not reach the higher floors, as seemed to be evident if one was there? There is a serious question about getting proper ladders to reach higher floors. It must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> People will say it is too early for answers and the Minister will probably say the same thing. These questions must be answered, especially when we consider there are even higher skyscrapers around the city, with more being built. We cannot have a fire service that is under-resourced. There are serious problems with recruitment in the fire service and the equipment being used. This has been raised a number of times. Attempts to remove the ambulance service from the fire brigade have been ongoing for a number of years and it is totally unacceptable. Everybody knows that the first people responding are the ambulance service personnel in the fire brigade. They are always on hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I thank Deputies for raising this very important matter. A fire broke out in an apartment on the 13th floor of the Metro Hotel and apartment building in Ballymun at approximately 8 p.m. last night, Wednesday, 21 March 2018. The fire extensively damaged the 13th and 10th floors of the building. The building was evacuated successfully and there are no reports of missing persons or injuries at this point. Eleven units of Dublin Fire Brigade, comprising eight fire engines, two aerial appliances and the incident command unit, involving approximately 60 firefighters under the command of the chief fire officer, responded and assisted with evacuation, as well as fighting the fire.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The fire has now been extinguished but the fire brigade remains in attendance. An Garda Síochána was at the scene overnight and managed traffic in the area to facilitate firefighting. It is understood the Garda will investigate the cause of the fire. The Dublin Fire Brigade will also carry out an initial review of the scene and its response in the days ahead. At this point, I am sure Deputies on all sides will join with me in expressing appreciation to the emergency services and all others involved in responding to the incident last night. I was kept informed as events unfolded through liaison between the fire brigade and officials in my Department. None of us is on the front line when it comes to these types of emergencies but it seems very tense from our point of view. We can only imagine what the firefighters felt. They are incredibly brave in the work they do.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> I turn now to the fire safety task force. I established it in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy of 14 June 2017 in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety in Ireland. On 27 June 2017, I tasked my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with convening and co-ordinating a high level task force to lead Ireland's reappraisal of fire safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> The task force held its tenth and most recent meeting on 22 February 2018. It discussed the most up to date draft of its report. In the intervening time, the national directorate had to deal with the significant snow event associated with Storm Emma and has not had an opportunity to consider the task force members' feedback on this latest draft. Notwithstanding this, I expect to receive the full report of the task force before the end of April.</p>
            <p eId="para_712"> In addition to establishing the task force, local authorities were requested to undertake a number of initial actions and the task force was requested to oversee and report on a review of fire safety in both social housing and fire safety in medium to high rise buildings. As part of these initial actions, local authorities, in June of last year, were asked to assess multistorey social housing buildings' fire detection and alarm systems, emergency lighting systems and common escape routes, including corridors, stairways and emergency exits, and to ensure that such systems are in place and fully functional.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> The local authorities responded fully to my request and carried out the inspections and works arising within the required timeframes. To give an indication of the extent of this exercise, 1,230 multi-storey social housing buildings in Ireland were reported back to my Department. They contain 16,780 flats. The four Dublin local authority areas had 64% of the buildings and 77% of the flats, the two Cork local authority areas had 7% of the buildings and 5% of the flats and the Limerick local authority area had 4% of the buildings and 4% of the flats. Overall, the review was a comprehensive exercise. It highlighted that local authorities are fully engaged in their fire safety responsibilities to those who rely on social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> This initial work in respect of the appraisal of fire safety in medium to high rise buildings was carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested. The work undertaken has identified 842 buildings within the medium and high rise category. A total of 291 of these were identified as having certain categories of external cladding. After preliminary consideration, local authorities, using their powers under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Act, have requested the persons having control of 237 of these buildings to have detailed fire safety assessments carried out. The work by persons having control of these buildings, and their professional advisers, to carry out and report the fire safety assessments is ongoing. As of the end of January, 99 fire safety assessments had been received by fire authorities, and further action is proposed or under consideration in eight cases - six residential and two non-residential.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> A guidance note - fire safety guidance note 01 of 2017 - Assessing existing cladding systems in buildings of more than six storeys, or more than 18 m in height - was developed by a task force subgroup and has been circulated to fire authorities and placed on my Department's website as a support for those undertaking assessments of cladding in medium to high rise building. The task force subgroup will maintain oversight of the review of these assessments in the months ahead, dealing with any emergent issues and providing an oversight report at the end of the process. It is understood the building in Ballymun which went on fire last night was identified in the survey of medium to high-rise buildings undertaken as part of the work of the fire safety task force in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire. Initial indications are that cladding was not a contributory factor in this fire.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> As indicated earlier, the fire will now be the subject to a full Garda investigation. The outcome will, of course, be carefully considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">I appreciate that very much.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> The fleet of fire engines available to fire services requires ongoing investment to ensure that reliable and appropriate fire engines are available to respond to emergencies. In order to ensure that fleet age profile is maintained, a further investment of €9.2 million, under the 2017 fire appliance procurement programme, was announced last year. It will see the construction and delivery of 23 new appliances between 2018 and 2020, with an expected contribution of €400,000 per unit from my Department's capital programme. Some fire authorities may choose to select aerial appliances - turntable ladders or hydraulic platforms - in lieu of allocated class B standard fire engines.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> I look forward to receiving the overview of fire safety in Ireland which the task force is preparing. I expect it will propose a programme of fire safety initiatives to address what the task force identifies as the priority areas of concern with regard to life safety. The evacuation process worked successfully to ensure public safety in last night's incident. However, in conjunction with Dublin City Council and Dublin Fire Brigade, I will consider if there are specific issues arising from this incident which require follow up action. I again express our deep appreciation to all our emergency services personnel and everyone else involved in ensuring a timely and effective response to last night's incident. They do this work on a daily basis on behalf of all of us but sometimes it takes a serious and alarming incident, such as occurred last night, for us to realise the importance of the work they do and the bravery they have in doing that work.</p>

            <p eId="para_724">I note what the Minister has to say in respect of the fire safety task force and the inspections being carried out by the local authorities. It is important that any remedial works identified would be carried out as soon as possible. There is urgency in respect of this situation. I have been informed by personnel from the Dublin Fire Brigade that many buildings have still not been examined. That includes nursing homes and high rise buildings in the Clongriffin estate in my constituency. We need clarity about that. There seems to be misinformation coming from some source. However, it is important that these remedial works are carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> Other speakers have mentioned the funding of the fire brigade. That is extremely important. It is believed that a direct funding mechanism is needed. The HSE is proposing the removal of the ambulance service from the Dublin Fire Brigade. This would be a retrograde step. The Dublin Fire Brigade must continue to provide a fire-based emergency medical service. That is international best practice. If it is not broken, do not fix it. The Minister should consult with the Minister for Health to ensure that is the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">Will the Minister give a commitment to publish all these fire reports? People are worried about their safety in the event of a fire. I raised this with the Minister about a year ago when a four storey block of apartments in my constituency burnt down on a sunny Saturday afternoon. There were no injuries thankfully. However, because of the upgrade of those apartment blocks that must be done following that disastrous fire, the residents may now be charged significant amounts of money. The Minister cannot say to people who are struggling with mortgages that they have to find thousands of extra euro or get out an additional mortgage or loan to fund fire safety. I refer to the fact that they got a certificate stressing fire safety was adequate when they bought their apartment or acquired their mortgage. That has to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> We also have to look at the proposal of the Minister and his party to have high rise as the new norm in Dublin without having adequate fire safety. He must publish the fire reports from the task force he referenced. It is wrong that they are not being published. They should be available on the wall of every apartment block.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">The Minister mentioned the task force and its tenth meeting. I refer to not having anything back by April. There is an urgency because he said many buildings were identified where work needed to be done and much of that has not been done. That needs to be addressed and they need to be forced to deal with this. People have lost their homes. How will the Minister help with this? There are also 100 staff out of work. Will the Minister get welfare officers to contact people who need help? Is there compensation available? Are there counselling services for people who went through trauma?</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> Many items have been lost. Will the welfare officers be instructed to help these people in respect of what has been lost? It is very important. The Metro Hotel was built in the regeneration of Ballymun. It was one of the landmarks. It is important that we get to the bottom of this and that this hotel is operational again.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">I appreciate the additional time the Acting Chairman gave me earlier so I will try to keep it even shorter than two minutes. Work has been ongoing in the medium and high rise category. That was the second phase of the task force group's work and 842 buildings were identified in that category. Further detailed assessments of fire and life safety measures were deemed to be needed for 237 buildings. As of the end of January this year, 99 of those assessments had taken place. Only eight cases from those 99 required further actions. Of those, six were residential buildings and two were non-residential.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">A significant amount of work is being done by the task force. Coming back to Deputy Ellis's point, the task force has had ten meetings. Since I set it up, it is preparing a report based on the actual work it is doing in the interim period. It is doing the actual work and then preparing a report on that work, which will inform us what we need to do in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> That work has been interrupted by Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma because it is the same group of people doing the work. Any new learning that will come from this latest incident will be considered when we have that work done by both the Garda and the fire services. When we have the report from the task force, including the extensive work done in all local authority owned multi-storey complexes, this will be published. What happened last night in Ballymun was a serious and dangerous event. Our emergency firefighters and those who helped people evacuate the hotel acquitted themselves admirably, as well as showing bravery and courage. What happened last night will not undermine our ambition for more high-rise buildings in Dublin. It is a key feature of what we need to do to deliver for the housing needs of our people. We can do it with safe buildings and have the fire services in place to ensure public safety and the safety of those who live in these buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> For those who suffered in this event, there are all sorts of supports available to them, in particular, the emergency needs payment. People can contact their social welfare offices to see what supports are available. If the Deputies are aware of anybody having difficulties in this regard, they can bring them to my attention.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_735">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I thank the House for the opportunity to present this important Bill. I have introduced much legislation both from the Opposition and Government benches over my time as a Member. Most legislation is focused on specific issues. This particular Bill, however, is actually informed by my five years in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when there was an extraordinary focus at that stage on measuring a much wounded economy. The mechanism our international partners required us to use was the standard measurement of gross domestic product, GDP. This became an overarching and important measure. If we did not reach the criteria set by our funders in reducing our deficit as a proportion of GDP, and if we did not raise the 3% deficit target within the specified timeline, our funding would have been withdrawn. It struck me right through that process that it was a sterile and an inadequate measure of the performance of the economy. It was necessary but, as a stand-alone instrument, it was shallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> We in Ireland now stand at a moment of tremendous opportunity after a lost decade of economic retrenchment. Any Government over the coming several years will have an additional resource of at least €3 billion a year. With such funds available, delivering on our cherished dream of a fair and equal Ireland is for the first time in our history within our grasp. We in the Labour Party know our goals for the future of our country. We want a society in which every citizen, to the extent of her or his ability, is properly equipped to participate in the social, economic and cultural life of our nation. Although our perspectives and policies might differ, many Members will agree now is the time to be ambitious for our country and our people. There are not many Members now who would repeat the infamous declaration of Margaret Thatcher that there is no such thing as society.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> It is all well and good to outline high aspirational levels of ambition. However, how will we decide to achieve those ambitions and what mechanisms will make the differences we want? We need goals but we need a plan and to prioritise. We also need the tools to measure the outcomes of society. This is true of all Governments and all political parties preparing manifestoes, regardless of one's politics or ideological view. Our common future will be shaped by the choices we make about employment, the environment and genuine equality of citizenship. It reaches into health care facilities, the elderly, young people, education and every other aspect of public life and administration. If we shape that future in a meaningful and real way, then we need to measure the impact of all our decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> That is what the Genuine Progress Indicators and National Distributional Accounts Bill 2017 is about. It is not about abandoning the traditional economic indicators of GDP, GNP, gross national product, or the new hybrid model, GNI*, gross national income (Star), after GNP itself was so criticised as a model for Ireland after a growth rate of 26%. I will not bore the House explaining how that is calculated. All of these are important because we need to measure our outputs. However, without sustainable growth, none of our ambitions can be realised. The Bill is about adding something new and fundamentally important to that mix and calculation. It is about agreeing formal independently assessed measurements for the impact of government policy on all the important factors which shape what is truly important, namely the quality of life of our people. There is no point in talking statistics if people's health services are inadequate, if their life expectancy or their life chances are not improving, or if the air we breathe, the water we drink and all the amenities we enjoy are not of a high standard. We have to start measuring these because they are just as important as any economic growth statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The truth is that growth indicators do not tell us the full story. It is important to know GNP and GDP. If one takes those measurements in isolation, however, then we overvalue the production and consumption of goods because that is all they measure. In turn, we fail to measure how much that growth reflects on genuine improvements for our people. Measurements such as this can play tricks on us. For example, if a factory creates pollution but then contributes through it to economic growth, it is measured as a good thing. If one spends money fixing the pollution caused by the factory, that is further economic growth, which is measured as a good thing. However, in reality that is bizarre.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The economist Simon Kuznets created the concept of GDP in 1934 when he developed it as a tool for measuring economic growth. At the time he wrote to the US Congress:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_742">The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income. Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and return, and between the short and the long term. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">That is an important question. What is it for and what does it contribute to the sum of our human good? It is because of arguments like these that more and more countries are turning to new measurements, not as alternatives but as real and important supplements to give a fuller and more accurate account of the well-being of their people.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I believe the role of genuine progress indicators, GPIs for short, will be to supplement the current measurements we have. Of course, when we get into the detail of these proposals, there will be plenty of scope for argument about what precisely we should measure and what parts of the economy we should give weight to, and we can debate that. These are important policy choices but making policy choices is what politics should be about. I look forward to the debate on the merits of the choices I have made in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I do not have the opportunity, given the speaking time, to go through the Bill in any great detail and it is hoped we will do that in committee. However, there is a second and equally important part to this Bill that I want to highlight for the House, and that is the proposal that we measure and publish national distribution accounts. We all know the last couple of decades have been good for capital growth but less so for income growth. While the world has grown richer, income inequality has increased in most countries. Policymakers and economists internationally have seen that trend and it has undoubtedly been a matter of important focus and the cause of a lot of head-scratching as to how it has come about. The first step must be to measure it accurately and comprehensively.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> At present, our national accounts focus on the macro totals that I know only too well. It is left to smaller-scale inequality studies to focus on the distribution of growth, and we do not do that in a particularly successful way. These studies, surveys and tax data are often not the most comprehensive way of doing this. As policymakers, we need accurate information to answer questions such as what fraction of economic growth at present accrues to the bottom half of the income level of the population, to the middle grouping or to the top 10%, and whether those distribution fractions are changing over time. Are the rich getting richer, are the poor getting poorer, is economic growth having an equal impact on everybody and how is it having that impact?</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I am standing beside the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. Our redistributive polices assisted greatly in equalising our society through tax transfers and public spending transfers, especially in the social welfare area, during our time of real economic difficulty. We had good redistributive mechanisms but the base level of income distribution in this country is very bad, and we need to know these things. We all have to agree about how this measurement should be done, but we do not fully and accurately have a mechanism for doing it right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> This Bill seeks to address what I believe are two important deficiencies in our national statistics, and I will try to precis this in the short speaking time I have. We need to have an agreed and independently measured set of genuine progress indicators on health status, on education status, on income redistribution, on the quality of our environment, air and water, and on access to amenity, all of which are socially important. The Bill would confer a new statutory function on the Central Statistics Office and the National Economic and Social Council to do that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> I should make clear that, in what follows, we in the Labour Party made our best effort to define what we believe are the issues that should be measured. However, as always in a legislative measure like this, we will be open to the views of every Member of this House. I genuinely believe this is a task that everybody should, could and will work collaboratively in achieving. We have defined "national distribution accounts" as meaning accounts that seek to measure the distribution of national income, including the distribution of economic growth, to compute growth rates for each quartile of income distribution. While I am sounding like an economist again, in essence, the point is the impact on each quartile of the population in terms of income, growth and policy decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> In the following sections of the Bill I have defined "genuine progress indicators" as meaning a measurement that supplements gross national income as a measure of economic growth, one that is designed to take full account of the well-being of the community by incorporating environmental and social factors which are not otherwise measured, and that integrates physical and monetary measures of human, social, environmental and economic well-being. While it sounds technical, it is simply a human societal measurement of the well-being of Ireland as a whole, as opposed to simply looking at economic growth in terms of extending production and consumption. I have added a table which provides examples, although they are simply indicative.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Under the heading "economic accounts" I would include measures such as gross national income, the balance of trade, disposable income in each household, expenditure, debt and whether household debt is rising or falling, Government business, student debt, employment, unemployment and underemployment, which is a huge issue because people are registered as employed but they are not getting a living wage. We would measure all of these things. In international statistics currently, while gross national product is a measurement of a country's performance, more countries include purchasing power parity as an equivalent. Gross national product divided by the population, giving GNP <i>per capita</i>, is a very crude measurement. What does it mean? On the other hand, purchasing parity comparators appear more relevant. For example, if a person in a country like Pakistan has $20,000 in income, that person's purchasing power is immeasurably different from a person with an income of $20,000 living in London in terms of the cost of food, rent, a taxi fare and so on. These are the real human impact measurements that we want to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I hope the Government will facilitate a very full debate on what I regard as one of the most important pieces of legislation I have had the privilege to introduce in the House. If we change the way we measure progress, we will actually change the way progress is achieved. I heartily recommend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">There is a growing demand for data on societal progress and well-being, and I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this important matter. While economic indicators such as gross domestic product are a useful measure of the overall progress of an economy, they reveal little about the well-being of citizens or the distribution of economic growth among different sectors of society. To measure societal well-being, supplementary indicators, including some of those referred to in the Bill, are therefore needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Having said that, while the Government shares the Deputy's views regarding the importance and value of a broader measurement of societal well-being and progress, the Government opposes this Bill for the following reasons. First, the Bill would potentially impact on the independence of the Central Statistics Office, CSO. The Bill would require the National Economic and Social Council to approve the methodology for the compilation of the genuine progress indicators and national distribution accounts. This would undermine the statutory independence of the CSO, whereby the director general has sole responsibility for and is independent in deciding the production of statistics, the statistical methodology, the content of releases and the timing and method of dissemination of statistics. This independence is enshrined in statute, under the Statistics Act 1993, and is explicitly referenced in the European statistics code of practice. The independence of national statistical institutes, such as the CSO, is also an established principle in Council Regulation 223/2009 on European statistics and in the UN fundamental principles of official statistics. It reflects best practice for the organisation of official statistics and ensures statistics are independent, impartial and reliable. The Government, in its commitment on confidence in statistics, on 30 May 2017 reconfirmed its commitment to continue to guarantee the independence of the CSO and the National Statistics Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> Second, the work programme of the CSO is largely defined by requirements arising from EU regulations and it is already challenging to balance those obligations with meeting the needs of national users.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">If the Bill is passed, the CSO would be obliged to add activities to its statistical programme without regard to the cost or competing demand for statistics, including its obligations under EU regulations. The passing of the Bill in its current form would impose revisions to established CSO work plans and business structures, resulting in delays to outputs that are already in progress and should address the principal data needs identified in the Bill. Those needs overlap with priorities already identified, including by the National Statistics Board. The NSB provides strategic direction to the CSO and establishes priorities for the compilation and development of official statistics. These data needs are, at least in part, addressed in current releases or will be satisfied by measures that are under development.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> As part of its work, the NSB has identified gaps in the Irish statistical programme in the areas of health, energy and the environment as well as a growing demand for new indicators on well-being and social progress. Reflecting these priorities, the CSO has established two new divisions: environment and energy; and income, consumption and wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> Under section 3, the Bill proposes that the CSO collect, compile and publish genuine progress indicators relating to economic accounts, social and human health accounts and environmental accounts on a yearly basis. A number of these are already published by the CSO. Regarding economic accounts, Government debt, net worth and savings figures are published in the Government finance statistics release. Regarding social and human health accounts, the CSO published The Wellbeing of the Nation 2017 in January, its first such report. That report is a composite report of more than 30 indictors across eight themes: economy; work; education; housing and natural environment; governance and equality, health; public safety; and time use. The release of well-being data is a new initiative for the CSO and will be further developed in the future. The CSO consulted the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, on the development of these indicators.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The CSO publishes on a biennial basis a sustainable development indicators report and is a participant in a pilot programme for capturing data on the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs. To date, 60 indicators for 14 of the 17 SDGs have been published.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Last month, the CSO published higher education outcomes – graduates of 2010 to 2014 - and, in June 2017, it published for the first time a system of health accounts release.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Since the establishment of the environmental and energy division, the CSO has almost doubled its number of environmental publications. Four new environmental publications are scheduled to be published this year covering some of the indicators listed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> As the Deputy pointed out, section 3 also proposes that the CSO would compile and publish national distributional accounts on a yearly basis to measure the distribution of economic growth. The importance of the distribution of income, consumption and wealth in determining the economic well-being of people and material inequalities has been recognised at a European level. It has, therefore, been agreed that a conceptual framework of standards and methods for European income, consumption and wealth statistics will be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The CSO conducts surveys of household income and income distribution through the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, of consumption through its household budget survey and, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, of wealth through the household finance and consumption survey. The SILC is the official source of data on household and individual income and provides a number of key national poverty indicators, such as the at-risk-of-poverty rate, the consistent poverty rate and rates of enforced deprivation. It further measures income equality across the entire income distribution. The CSO conducted a household finance and consumption survey in 2013 and will conduct a second such survey in 2018 for publication in late 2019. The CSO is proposing to embed this wealth survey into its programme of household surveys. The expansion of this work on wealth-related statistics would provide the full picture of the distribution of income, consumption and wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> As this model evolves, the intention of the CSO is to publish statistics on the joint distribution of income, consumption and wealth. The CSO is also beginning to develop options regarding national distribution accounts, which will involve producing estimates of the distribution of income and wealth that are consistent with national accounts macro aggregates.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Considering all the work currently under way, it does not seem necessary to legislate to create a parallel statutory process involving the NESC to identify further statistical requirements in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> The Bill proposes assigning new functions to the NESC, which would be required to approve the methodology for the compilation of genuine progress indicators and national distributional accounts. Under section 4, the Bill also proposes that the NESC would be required to produce an assessment each year of the impact of the budget on economic and social inequality, poverty reduction, and income and wealth distribution. The NESC would be required every five years to assess these impacts in terms of the cumulative effect of the previous five budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> In addition to impinging on the statistical independence of the CSO, the assignment through legislation of additional functions to the NESC would impact on its ability to achieve its current work programme. As the House will be aware, the role of the NESC is to analyse and provide advice on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development. The council's current work programme up to 2019 comprises three themes. First is a key social challenge: low-work intensity households, quality tailored services and participation. Second is climate change: governance of the low-carbon transition. Third is land value, land use and urban development.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Over the coming years, Ireland faces into a period of significant change at home and abroad that will present new and exceptional challenges. A Programme for a Partnership Government specifically notes that there are policy challenges where long-term thinking is required. It is important that the NESC, as a research and advisory body, has the scope and flexibility around its work programme to be able to take on board Government priorities and address issues that have emerged from its own work or consultations.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> Following the end of the term of the previous council in 2016, some time was taken to reflect on its role and working methods. A number of changes were made aimed at making the council more effective, including fewer plenary meetings, more in-depth discussions on issues through working groups and committees, and a reduced membership while also capturing a broad range of views. The new council was appointed in 2017 and the priority now is to bed down these changes and allow the NESC to fulfil its strategic advisory role. It is appropriate to allow these changes to become firmly established in advance of legislating to give significant new functions to the NESC.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> It is not clear that the NESC is best placed to produce impact assessments of budget measures. A wide range of bodies already engage in budget scrutiny, including the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Parliamentary Budget Office and civil society stakeholders such as Social Justice Ireland. The Departments of Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection conduct an <i>ex post</i> impact assessment of the main tax and social welfare measures introduced in the budget. The ESRI, using data from the CSO's SILC, publishes its assessment of the progressivity of the budgetary measures introduced. A new social impact assessment framework has been designed that broadens the scope of the analysis and focuses on schemes and spending programmes that have explicit socioeconomic objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Additionally, the programme for Government contains a commitment to "develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights." A policy paper, entitled Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland, was published alongside budget 2018. A pilot approach to gender budgeting has been adopted in the Revised Estimates for public services 2018, published in December 2017, with six Departments including indicators relating to equality objectives. The intention is that the publication of high-level objectives and associated indicators will enhance transparency around the level of progress towards achieving equality objectives. The pilot programme of equality budgeting will be reviewed following the 2018 budgetary cycle. Lessons from the pilot approach will be used to expand the initiative to other expenditure programmes and equality dimensions for the 2019 budgetary cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> For all the aforementioned reasons, the Government does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to introduce primary legislation prescribing the types of statistical releases to be published by the CSO or assigning new functions to the NESC. However, we acknowledge the intention behind the Bill and I reiterate that the CSO is committed to developing indicators that go beyond GDP and is well advanced in meeting the user need for a measure of progress beyond GDP as identified by the NSB in its long-term strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> The CSO is always open to engaging with stakeholders, including the Oireachtas, on identifying statistical needs and data gaps. A mid-term review of the NSB's strategy will be launched in the near future, which will provide a further opportunity for stakeholders to engage on user needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Such engagement would be a more appropriate way of identifying needs than primary legislation such as this Bill and more valuable to the user.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Cassells<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_775">I am pleased to contribute to this debate and compliment Deputy Howlin on bringing forward the Bill because there is huge merit in what he has outlined in terms of the measurement of progress in this country. It is hugely relevant in the Ireland of today because of the society that has been created where communities have been built that are devoid of the basic public infrastructure required for a fulfilling family life. One must ask if we are truly assessing how the country is doing if the only metrics used to analyse our current circumstances are the crude tools currently in place. Many in our society have been saddled with massive personal debt through the purchase of their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> It is interesting that the debate on Second Stage is taking place on this date because on 18 March 1968, almost exactly 40 years ago, Bobby Kennedy made some historic remarks on the subject in the University of Kansas where he addressed the value of gross domestic product and its measurement of the things that mattered. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_777">Gross National Product counts cigarette advertising ... special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them ... armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities ... [and] the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages ... It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">His words 40 years ago ring true today and for every generation because at some point everybody realises what is important in life. The measurement of goods and services produced is not a true reflection of how we are doing as a society. If we were to canvass in any of the massive housing estates in the country we would see whether those very sterile indicators were a real reflection of how well society was doing. Things may be improving gradually for some in the country but many, such as those who fear their mortgages may be offloaded to vulture funds by unscrupulous banks, have seen no improvement in their circumstances. The measurement of what is happening to those who have a few more euro in their pockets in society as a whole is not necessarily positive. </p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Deputy Howlin mentioned Mr. Simon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measuresments of national income. In his report to Congress in 1934 he stated: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_780">Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">There is huge merit in the Bill and the principles contained within it. It will resonate massively with Irish people who may have good employment, but the circumstances in which they live their lives tell a different story. </p>
          <p eId="para_782"> We must consider the tools necessary to measure today's society which has been massively altered in the past 20 years, in particular. Hundreds of thousands of people from Dublin are living in counties such as my own, County Meath, as well as counties Kildare, Wicklow, Louth and further afield because they could not find affordable housing in their own county. There is a complete lack of vital public infrastructure in many of the new communities that have been created. I mention this because of the table Deputy Howlin has outlined in the Bill of the indicators he seeks to measure. Vital social infrastructure is lacking, including child care facilities, libraries, swimming pools and recreational facilities. Health services are at breaking point. This week the local newspaper in my town of Navan ran a front-page story about people being turned away from doctors' practices. Many communities are devoid of proper public transport links which would allow the people we have put into the commuter counties to commute to their place of work in the city. Some must rely on existing overburdened public transport services, while in other areas there is simply no service available. My home town of Navan has a population in excess of 35,000 people, but there is no train line and no hope of getting one under the Ireland 2040 plan. What kind of life do the thousands of people who have to commute from the town at 5.30 a.m. each day have? Do the metrics currently used give a proper reflection of the life they lead and indicate that all is happy and well based on a crude analysis of income? They do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Yesterday the Oireachtas Library and Research Service afforded Members the opportunity to look at CSO statistics superimposed on constituency maps. It drilled down townland by townland and street by street to find out how many people were employed and unemployed in each area and to reveal the figures for youth unemployment. That is the cold statistical analysis, but Members know the stories behind each of these areas and about the other important aspects such as the debt with which people have been saddled, the lack of infrastructure in certain areas and the impact on areas surrounding these townlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> There would be huge merit in examining other aspects, as outlined in the Bill. Fianna Fáil supports the principles behind the Bill, although it will need further detailed scrutiny to ascertain its full impact. The CSO is an independent agency and we would not compel it to use metrics which it believes may be inaccurate owing to a lack of data. Notwithstanding this, the Bill and this debate are hugely important and have significant merit because Members must always have the interests of those whom they represent at the centre of their minds when discussing what is important.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_785">I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome the Bill on genuine progress indicators which are the only way to measure the well-being of a nation and its people. Until now, we have had <i>ad hoc</i> and partial responses in looking at budget time at the brief impact of national economic and budgetary policy but not in the profound ways proposed in the Bill. The Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, has commenced a study of gender equality budgeting. The basic programme of action in this area which is being pursued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform offers an opportunity to finally have a serious gender equality impact analysis of each budget from budget 2018 onwards. We are targeting budget 2019, in particular, with reference to areas such as child care and encouraging more young women to take up apprenticeships and so on. I have requested - the committee has agreed to my request - that a disability impact analysis be promoted and monitored in respect of budget 2019. In the coming weeks the committee will be meeting Senator John Dolan who chairs the Oireachtas disability group, of which I am also a member, and other leading advocates in the disability sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> As I stated, there have been cursory attempts in the past to poverty-proof budgets. Essentially, they amounted to public relations exercises. Budget expenditure books generally included two or three pages of poorly researched data to try to put forward the idea that even draconian austerity budgets were somehow fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Indeed, Deputy Howlin, as former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will be familiar with those from the past. There was never a serious effort to estimate the often vicious impacts of budgetary decreases on the most vulnerable sectors of our community, who went through a lot of suffering. I recall, for example as a Labour Party energy spokesperson in the past, developing policies to address energy poverty, but there was poor statistical and research data on this crucial aspect of poverty although every year people’s lives were shortened by energy poverty. There was no proper appreciation on the part of Government of this huge area in poverty, particularly for senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> We also had the phenomenon of the green impact analysis of budgets when the Green Party was in power with Fianna Fáil, the headings of which are echoed in section 2 under environmental accounts. The then Minister, John Gormley, came into the House and gave a pointless review of mostly green aspirations which Fianna Fáil had no intention of fulfilling. That Government, of course, led the country into a terrible crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> During the 2011-2016 austerity Government, led by Fine Gael, I introduced the High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill 2014. The Bill sought to establish a nine-person commission within the Central Statistics Office, CSO, whose task would be to regularly inform the public about levels of wealth and income across society. Data collection and compilation on income and wealth were the starting point and the Bill was inspired by states such as Norway where everybody’s income and level of taxable wealth is freely available to all citizens. Any citizen can find out what the wealth and income is of any other citizen. The Minister at the time, Deputy Noonan, thought the proposal astonishing and hilarious.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The commission I proposed was to engage in research on best practice models of income distribution, which echoes in the first table in Deputy Howlin's Bill under economic accounts. It was to seek to determine an appropriate structure in which the awarding of executive high pay and other remuneration may be reformed. The Bill was aimed at outrageous executive high pay, notably of bankers and bosses in the construction sector, who paid themselves millions of euro per annum. That Bill went much further towards enabling a fairer and more equal society than Deputy Howlin’s Bill before us today but the general approach in Deputy Howlin’s legislation is a useful starting point for what my 2014 legislation was seeking to achieve. Sadly, of course, the High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill 2014 was strongly rejected by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, Deputy Howlin’s former colleague, and the Bill was voted down by the Fine Gael-led austerity Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Legislating for the concept of genuine progress indicators in section 2, or socio-economic indicators, would be a valuable step forward to move towards a more egalitarian society. Deputy Howlin has given useful examples in section 2(2) of the areas which would be key genuine progress indicators for national distributional accounts. At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of course, we have grappled with the problems of measuring GNP and GDP, especially after the incredible statistical jump in 2015. The new GNI* index seeks to address some of the volatility caused by multinational capital and knowledge movements but even GNI* is only a very broad and tentative measure of Ireland’s economic performance. Indeed, it was interesting today to read Kieran McQuinn of ESRI saying that a totally new index was necessary to measure underlying growth in the Irish economy, never mind move to the kind of analysis in which this Bill rightly asks us to engage, given the distortions of the part caused by our large multinational sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The collection of much better data on citizen’s livelihoods, including household savings and expenditure, would be an important step forward. The inclusion of transport infrastructure is also useful and it was interesting to hear Deputy Cassells speaking about transport links to County Meath to serve the growing population in the county. The big lacuna, however, in the suggested list for economic accounts is housing. Did the last two austerity Governments carry out any cost-effectiveness analysis of the total shutting down of social and public housing, and the problems the huge backlog in social housing has caused? Any such cost-effective analysis would have shown that the future personal and social costs were staggering and far overshadowed arrangements made to finance the outrageous blanket bank guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The suggested social and human health accounts would also be very helpful. Fr. Seán Healy and Social Justice Ireland have drawn our attention to how badly Ireland is performing on a range of UN-backed indicators covering the economy, environment and society. Social Justice Ireland’s sustainable progress index 2018 highlights how poorly Ireland has performed on low pay, long-term unemployment, household debt and greenhouse gas emissions, so the metrics outlined under social and human health accounts are very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> Deputy Howlin's second list of useful indicators, the social and human wealth accounts, are very valuable, particularly for unpaid work and the work of carers, who do a huge amount of work which society barely recognises in GDP or GNI figures. Road traffic accidents are included under the human capital, health and wellness heading and I have a particular interest in this. Indeed, I am pursuing reforming legislation to bring about Vision Zero for road transport. The huge impact on people's lives from the maladministration of traffic law has a negative impact on society. The environmental accounts, the environmental footprint analysis, the natural capital accounts and the ecosystem services to which the Deputy refers are also very valuable.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> The Genuine Progress Indicators and National Distributional Accounts Bill 2017 is an important Bill and it would give a useful remit to statisticians in our national organisations to pursue certain indicators. In other countries, especially Scandinavia, they have experience of monitoring areas which impact on citizens' lives and it would be right to do the same in this country. We would then be able to frame national economic and budgetary policy from a standpoint of real knowledge of how our people are living.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">I welcome this Bill from Deputy Howlin and Sinn Féin will be supporting it. Ever since the Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, tweeted about leprechaun economics, the use of GDP as a way of measuring our national accounts has come to close to being a laughing stock. The progress made in coming up with GNI*, a unique way of measuring our unique economy, is welcome but ultimately the EU, for example, measures only GDP, GNI and so on. Like GNI*, its impact is only to provide a fuller picture. Legally, in terms of fiscal rules and so on, I do not believe it is designed to have any impact. It is worthwhile, though.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> Only a fool thinks the state of a country can be measures in economic figures. Bhutan measures gross national happiness, and why not? We are not quite going that far but this Bill maps out alternative ways of measuring how well or otherwise we are doing. It also touches on equality budgeting, with the National Economic and Social Council being mandated to report annually and every five years on the equality impact of budgets or a series of budgets. There has been, to be fair, a lot of progress in this area with the Department of Finance providing far more detail each year on the breakdown of who benefits and who does not. There are people who are still prone to spin, though, and a more neutral body to carry out this work is a worthwhile suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Section 2 defines genuine progress indicators. The list is detailed and interesting and I am sure that if we get to Committee Stage, there could be some other suggestions.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Section 3 requires the NESC, working with the CSO, to come up with a way of compiling the necessary statistics. Section 4 relates to the equality budgeting element I already mentioned. Environmental and social sustainability and improvement must accompany economic progress otherwise what is the point?</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Deputy Howlin's Bill represents an attempt to put the wisdom of humanity about the nature of what constitutes progress into law and deserves further consideration on Committee Stage. I am happy to support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">It is the tenth anniversary of what has been called in stockbroking circles the "St. Patrick's Day massacre". During a booming Irish economy, it was the day on which time was called by the disastrous fall in stock prices that engulfed Bear Stearns and when the writing was on the wall for the casino capital model of Anglo Irish Bank. However, the problem was not confined to Anglo Irish Bank. Like a horror movie, it went on to destroy the rest of the banks and the Irish economy. What was the outcome of the St. Patrick's Day massacre? Not too long after it, Bertie Ahern announced that he was going to stand down as Taoiseach, which he did. Brian Cowen took over and was very unhappy for a while because he was the person who was going to succeed Mr. Ahern. Mr. Cowen succeeded him not in the best of times, which I think was what he expected, but in the worst of times. Nonetheless, that summer, that new Fianna Fáil Cabinet led by Brian Cowen effectively proceeded to party around the country in celebration of achieving office. I say this simply to highlight the differences between certain kinds of reality. There were things to celebrate. The country was richer than ever before and yet this appearance of riches and wealth was built completely on sand, particularly the model whereby people borrowed too much in order to pay for houses and to finance business ventures.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> One does not need to be an economist to figure out that the way economics measures different things is highly inadequate. As accountants say about a balance sheet, it is literally a moment in time. When that moment passed, those economists and, in particular, various bankers used to come into this House used to say "Ah, but the fundamentals are sound" while the country fell apart around us. We had lost the capacity to explain, by means of normal economics, what was happening. Some time later, we could count the 330,000 people who lost their jobs but, of course, that was not done by the Department of Finance but by the lowlier Department of Social Protection because it did not have particular access to economic insights or economic control. Joseph Stiglitz, who used to - perhaps he still does - hold a part-time lecturing position in UCD, is a very distinguished American economist. In his very important book <i>The Price of Inequality</i>, which was published during those years, he used Ireland as a model on several occasions. He was sympathetic to the fact that our social welfare system, as with those of most other European countries, is completely redistributive. Without our social welfare system here, up to 60% of the Irish population probably would have fallen into deep poverty - that is, fallen off the cliff - as a consequence of the collapse. Instead, through redistributive transfers via the social welfare system, the levels of poverty hardly increased. In fact, Fianna Fáil had a fantastic economic argument in those days. It argued that if 300,000 people lost their jobs, society became more equal because the incomes of these people went down. The theory was that as a result - and one can figure it out by simple arithmetic - society became more equal because there were fewer people who were in the middle levels and were either somewhat better off or better off. This is the difficulty with economic analysis and it is why economists are often referred to as being two-handed - on the one hand and on the other hand. If they had three or four hands, they would keep going - all to offer different options but never to make decisions themselves. In respect of accounting, which to some extent economics is about, Joseph Stiglitz said that people in countries around the world now know that GDP <i>per capita</i> does not provide a good picture of what is happening to most citizens and how the economy is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> The front page of the business section of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> leads with a story about the ESRI calling for new national accounts to cope with multinational distortions. Kieran McQuinn, the head of the ESRI, suggested that the growth figures we have just seen are effectively a product of the extreme distortion of our national statistics by perhaps ten to 20 highly profitable multinational companies. I think we mostly all know the companies in question. The ESRI suggests that the real figure would be something like half of the suggested figure and that, in the future, real growth figures, as experienced by people across Ireland, would be in the order of 3% or 4% and not in the order of the 7% or 8% the current figures give as our answer to the question of how we are doing as a country. Trying to reach an agreement on how to count, be it from an economic or accounting point of view, is very important because it is on that basis that this country can borrow, which we need to do to be able to do in order to invest in all of the different areas in capital investment we need. It is on this basis that businesses will invest and employ so they need a reliable measure because they need to be able to make their economic decisions. Nonetheless, the system is inherently faulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> During my time as Minister for Social Protection, I had many meetings with the ESRI because, together with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it carries out the only work in this area and has been doing so for some time. That is the social impact assessment that is carried out shortly after every budget to find out in broad social terms who are the likely winners and losers in the budget. That is based on the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model. The ESRI and people like Tim Callan acknowledge that this model is quite flawed. It is an attempt to measure in a way that does take into account factors such as how different sectors in society are doing. Lone parents and their children, particularly lone parents with some work, did particularly well out of the budgets of 2014, 2015 and 2016, especially the latter two, because family income supplement was increased significantly. However, it is very difficult to capture that in the context of the way economic counting is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I welcome the attempt to find a way of identifying genuine progress indicators, which is a good and reasonable objective. However, I am sceptical about how easy this is to explain. I will not repeat the stories here, but Lyndon Johnson, the former American President, had some great comments about politicians talking about economics and by and large he advised them not to do it. It is a nerdy science and a dismal science. It requires from politicians something close to the patience of Job to listen to it in detail and to try to marry it to the programmes that politicians want which is usually about building new schools, new roads, expanding ports and increasing the well-being of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The other issue we need to address is as follows. We have the SWITCH model in which it is not possible to include, for instance, the value of a medical card. Many economists might not know in detail how important a medical card can be to a family. Irrespective of the side of the political spectrum they come from, almost everybody in this House understands the significance of a medical card. Does a person with an income of €10,000 without a medical card have the same wealth as another person with €10,000 in income but who has a medical card? The models are exactly the same, but in practice most of us in this House know that there is an important difference. That is the problem with our current measurement system. Irrespective of whether it is something very large or something very small, such as the impact on a household of a medical card, we are not at the moment able to measure it.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> Deputy Howlin's proposal goes some way to trying to address some of these issues. I wish the Bill well. I would love to see it happening, but I think it may be a while yet before it does.</p>

          <p eId="para_808">I am very pleased to be able to support this Bill presented by the Labour Party and to reflect on some of its provisions. This legislation represents exactly the type of reform we should be looking to make to our public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> I will start with a couple of personal anecdotes that reflect my perspective. I studied business studies in UCD in the early 1980s. On my first day my first class on macroeconomics was given by a man called Dessie Norton. In a big theatre like this Chamber, he started out by saying, "Remember this, boys and girls, and don't ever forget it. The first law, the first assumption upon which everything is built is that people are profit maximisers. All our rules and laws after that extend out." I did not realise that at the time I was getting what Kate Raworth has described as the classic economics education which has been set in stone almost for 50 or 60 years and which is still there to the current day even in the supposed best economic schools. I remember as an 18 or 19 year old thinking in my heart of hearts that that was too simple an assumption. It did not describe me. I was not just a profit maximiser. Throughout my life working in the business world and elsewhere my experience has been that we have had a real difficulty in that economic analysis is too narrow. The assumptions on which it is built are false because they start off with some of those flawed assumptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> I will give a second personal reflection. During the depths of the crash we experienced almost ten years ago, someone using the advice of John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, said in the course of the banking collapse that the first thing we needed to do was to stabilise, but we then needed to reform. We have done the stabilisation bit. We are beyond it and are now back in Celtic tiger boom years with 7% growth. However, we have not done the reform or certainly not to the extent we could and should. I refer to reform in the biggest sense of a completely different form of economics. It is not just the indicators we need to change. Our core understanding of economics needs to change and beyond that politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> I recently saw a video by George Monbiot, the British journalist, environmentalist and labour activist, which took a very broad approach. He asked, "What is the story in politics in our modern world?" He said that for 30 or 40 years after the Second World War the story was a social democratic one with big government providing services and protecting people against big bad businesses. For a variety of reasons that changed in the winter of discontent and the crisis of confidence, as the former US President, Jimmy Carter, called it, in the late 1970s. It became a different story in that markets would deliver what we wanted and would protect us from big bad government, which was seen as not the order of the day. Strangely the social democrats became the greatest disciples of that orthodoxy. People such as Tony Blair with his third way accepted the mantra that markets knew best and that one would have to let capital free to deliver the services we want. That, as an economic orthodoxy and a political orthodoxy, the Washington consensus, was there right through to 2008, but it is no longer credible.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> Based on conventional economics, who could have believed that we would be printing money at scale, as we have done for the past ten years, and still have no inflation? The whole discipline of economics is in a crisis of confidence. Those outside have no confidence in it and those inside must be wondering what, in God's name, was the purpose of all those lessons they learnt because none of it seems to make sense anymore.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> We need a new economics that knows how to value natural capital, which economics has never done. We need to put a price on the externalities that take place in our current industrial business system. I support this legislation because it addresses one element of that. We need to change our assumptions, some of the algorithms and the basic nature of economics. However, part of the shift is changing what we measure. I commend the Labour Party on trying to do this in the Bill it has brought to the House. We also looked at this briefly at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. As well as through this legislation, we need to use that committee to try to bring it into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> Earlier I spoke about the nature of reform. This is a reforming Dáil. We have the potential to make real reform and we have achieved some of it. That we were able to establish the Parliamentary Budget Office signalled a huge advance in the workings of this Parliament. It has not really kicked in yet. We will only see the benefit in five, ten or 15 years. In this reforming process we have not exactly had huge support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance, which may be slightly caught in an old economics view of the world. That they for so long questioned the need for or the approval of a budget oversight office - indeed we have people here who were very involved in the process - shows that they were out of date with where the new economy needs to go. However, we have it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> I suggested in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that we should meet officials from the CSO to discuss this very issue. I have read the Minister of State's speech and I understand his perspective on the legal, administrative and other difficulties with changing the nature of our national accounts given the need to adhere to EUROSTAT rules and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I think that we should, as a country, push to do the best we can to be part of the new economy. Our position in the world is very fraught because we have Brexit and Trump. I do not think we should do what I fear the Taoiseach did in Washington last week, which is to cling on to the old Washington consensus or indeed Donald Trump's warped economic nationalist version of it. We have to go to the Brexit talks or indeed in dealing with Donald Trump's administration with certain values and we have to stand for something. We have to stand for this new economic view of the world, one which recognises that we need globalisation but it cannot be a race to the bottom. It has to be fair. There have to be fair labour laws and environmental standards. The very nature of how we measure progress should change towards a sustainable economic model in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I would like to see the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and our own Parliamentary Budget Office going into some of the details of this. I think it is very much justified. Time spent on that would be very valid and we should tease out how whatever the concerns the Department has can be resolved and how we could make this real. We should make it real in the sense that it does not just affect statistics or national accounts but decision-making about where we go from here. The outcome is that it changes our budget decision-making process. It changes our whole industrial and enterprise policy, which may then become less reliant on just foreign direct investment, growth at all costs numbers games where we say that we are doing great because our economy is growing by a certain percentage and then find that we have another burst bubble three to five years later. This should develop towards a leap to a new economic model which manages the natural resource constraints that we have and gives us greater stability. It should not put us as we are increasingly seen in the world, as a low corporate tax location, as opting out on climate and being seen as a bit too cute in every way in the way that we gain from the international economic system at present. We should be seen as a leading, responsible country, developing new economics that bring poor countries out of poverty, that protect our standard of living, that use the transition to go towards a more equal distribution of wealth in our country and others and that set certain standards. One measures those standards by the sorts of indicators that are set out here. I would like to see us doing that. I would like to see this legislation passed and, if it is not possible for us to pass it, for us to go into the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and to use the Parliamentary Budget Office to take this work further.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_818">It is always a good debate when we are looking into the future and not always looking at the past and what was not done right. I get a sense that people want to develop new pastures and new ground. I welcome the contributions in that regard. An overarching thing that I have learned in my position, having met with officials from the CSO, is that they value their independence. That independence allows them to do and make work plans. That does not mean that they construct the material. They have said that they are interested in meeting with stakeholders. I am sure that they are listening to this debate today and what Deputies have had to say. Maybe there are other areas that we could look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> Deputy Broughan advocated what is happening outside the CSO, for example, the benefits of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and its good work, which Deputy Eamon Ryan alluded to, which is a consequence of new politics in this House. There is also the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, would be very familiar with as well. There are the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Parliamentary Budget Office, as well as civil society. Deputy Broughan mentioned Social Justice Ireland and the good work that it does. We have many bodies, think-tanks, statisticians and people doing analysis. It is up to the Government to govern and make decisions on the back of that. That was the fundamental basis for the development of the ten year capital programme, the 2040 plan - statistics, where people will be living, where industries will be, where roads and railways are needed and where interconnectivity is. It is working towards the future. Deputy Burton talked about history lessons and certain kinds of reality and measurements relating to the medical card. That is something that can be explored. I am sure the CSO would have no issue with that. Deputy Eamon Ryan talked about sitting down with the CSO. I encourage everybody in this House to sit down with it. It is available and happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> Given the time constraints that we all have here with the firefighting work that we do, we should still endeavour to have that time set aside to look at proactive work. The National Statistics Board is doing much of the work that there is a suggestion to do within primary legislation. Will there be overlap, cross-pollination and is it necessary to look at redeveloping a primary legislative wheel within legislation that is primarily independent? With regard to Deputy Cassells' issues, he had a caveat. He talked about protecting the independence and supporting what Deputy Howlin was bringing forward, but he was also talking about transport and the needs of transportation for his own constituency in County Meath with increased population. We have all the data relating to or through our census and it is that data which the CSO analyses and about which it is very circumspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> I believe that it is always important to have the debate on this and to talk about doing new things in a new way. In a week when we were talking about blurred lines relating to independence and independence of government, it is a little ironic that we are here having a debate where we have a completely independent Secretary General and CSO and are looking at deviating from that independence in some way. That being said, I am not being mischievous about that. I am just thinking of all the different inputs here. It reminds me of a fellow from my own neck of the woods. Mar a deir an fear seo, nuair atá achan rud ráite agus é déanta, tá i bhfad níos mó ráite ná mar atá déanta. When all is said and done, there is much more said than done. Sometimes we are good at talking the talk in this House but there is the matter of implementation. We have statisticians and people in the requisite offices to do the work. They will not be looking to next October, February or the following October to another general election, or maybe even in two to three years' time-----</p>

          <p eId="para_823">If they are going to be subject to new Governments coming in, primary legislation, new work plans and trying to develop their own, I do not think it would be a good thing. It is very important that they remain independent. The big message from the CSO today is that it is open to sitting down with people with their ideas and I am sure it is listening very attentively to contributions here today.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-22T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_824">I thank all the Deputies who contributed and particularly the Deputies who supported this legislation, including Deputies Cassells, Broughan, O'Reilly and Eamon Ryan. Very instructive things were said. I am very disappointed in the Minister of State's response. I say this as somebody who was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for more than five years. I know that Ministers get scripts, come in here and read the scripts. The Minister of State's second intervention was more thoughtful. I believe that we need to think fundamentally differently. The notion that, somehow, it is not our role to do that is quite shocking and it is not acceptable to me. The Bill is primarily a social and economic Bill. The Minister of State's original speech was a legal and administrative rebuttal. We are the lawmakers. If there are legal impediments to things that we need to do, we change them and move them out of the way. To say that administratively they are too busy doing other things is not an argument at all. We determine the priorities of the agencies of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> The most serious disagreement I have had with the Minister of State is on the notion of independence. I have dealt very closely with the CSO because its figures determined whether we got the money drawdowns. It is completely independent. I did not always agree with some of its assessments and we had very robust discussions about them. I would preserve its independence absolutely. I refer to its statistical independence which the Bill does not suggest would be altered one whit. It certainly should not be independent to determine what it should measure. We are the policy makers; we determine what tools we need to make policy. Its job, when we tell it what should be measured, is to do it objectively and independently. It is a complete canard to talk about an intrusion on its independence. The people who crafted the speech for the Minister of State know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> I will focus on some of the points made by Deputy Eamon Ryan. I strongly agree with him. We need to move away. It is convenient - I was that soldier - for a variety of different groups, including voluntary groups, social justice groups and survey groups to be doing all this work because it is not official. It does not have the same status of the measurement of economic growth. We do not allow <i>ad hoc</i> groups to measure our economic growth or our unemployment statistics. We do that ourselves because they are critical and we regard them as critical. The measurements I am suggesting now are equally critical and should not be disregarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I was tempted when I heard the original speech to reflect on the immortal phrase of Oscar Wilde that nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. We know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Deputy Louise O'Reilly talked about Bhutan measuring a happiness indicator. Contentment is a result of a variety of things. It is not exclusively the result of wealth or growth. In my initial contribution I asked what growth is for if not to add to the sum of happiness or well-being of the people. It has to be for a purpose. Deputy Eamon Ryan would argue that the following of growth for itself is absolutely a destructive model. I have to mention one difference. I would not always defend Tony Blair but the notion he was a pure defender of the capitalist system is more than a tad unfair. He was a very strong advocate of regulated capitalism. Our problem in the last decade is that capitalism globalised but the regulation of capital did not. That is why I am an internationalist and believe in institutions like the European Union and OECD, to regulate capital. I believe that on issues like corporate taxation we need a global response, not an individual or regional response. We need to have a global response to the issue of mobile capital in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> I ask the Minister of State to think again. I am very conscious that Bills are introduced with an alacrity such that they are like trains coming, three a week, and Governments have to knock them back as best they can. The Minister of State talked about the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. At least three of us in the House were involved in the reform committee and trying to get that done was like pushing a boulder up a hill. The people pushing it the other way were my former colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, among others. If they were not pushing it back down, they were not exactly facilitating its upward trajectory. That is a reality. There is an inertia in terms of reform in the real sense. That is why when we walked across the threshold of Government in 2011, both Fine Gael and Labour had done the analysis and established a new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because we had to balance the books. I listened to people describe that Government as an austerity Government. When income falls by a third and one is trying to maintain expenditure at a level a third greater than income, any household will say there is a problem. Our discernment was we needed not only to balance the books so we could afford to maintain the infrastructure of the State but that we also needed reform. A significant process of reform was undertaken, not all of it visible. My real concern now is that the reform focus has diminished and will disappear entirely. Maybe even the Department will disappear entirely as we get back to normal activity as if reform was not required on a permanent basis. I urge the Minister very strongly to think again.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Over 200 Bills have passed Second Stage. In this state of limbo that is new politics, it is becoming a joke. It is a very serious joke for the 200 Bills, many of which are worth enacting, although some are not. They all deserve to be processed through to the end. There is a notion we should let everything pass. Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Labour Party will support the Bill and it will pass Second Stage, whatever the Minister of State's view is but that is not good enough. It is an important issue which we need to embrace and I hope the Minister of State will so we can at least have a debate on these issues and not say it has been done by the oversight committee or IFAC or somebody else. Let us as a House determine we want a different set of indicators and see how we can progress it. I will happily give my energies to the committee system to try to advance it. I ask the Minister of State to give it further consideration and hopefully goodwill when it comes to be voted upon next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I will address a remark to the Ceann Comhairle. I have genuine concerns that when we pass legislation here on Second Stage, it has to mean something. When we pass resolutions, as we did earlier today, the Government might not like the instruction of the House, for example the instruction to abolish the strategic communications unit. If the formal resolution of the House has as much meaning and impact as a show of hands at a debating society in one of our colleges, we are in a very dangerous place because it was never the case until this Dáil. If the core and essence of new politics is to take power back to this assembly and rebalance the power of the Executive, it will be meaningless, very destructive and undermining of this place if the Executive can simply say it will ignore it all. They are really important issues we have to address. I say it in the full understanding of the pressure on the Executive. I say this as a small party in Opposition: it might be the case that we have too many Bills coming through. We might need to have a better filtration system and we are considering that.</p>
