#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	It is clear that the personal affairs of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, are not completely in order, despite the Taoiseach's statement yesterday, given that he has failed to honour a High Court order on the debt.  What is even more alarming is the complete lack of order in the financial affairs of the Department of Health and the health service.  The latest reports suggest that the deficit overrun was close to €280 million by the end of May and the figure rose by €80 million in one month.  It is projected to go to €500 million.Thanks to a freedom of information request by Mr. Martin Wall of The Irish Times, we have received insight into the incredible correspondence ongoing within the health service.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin-----

There is no HSE governing board.  The serious issue is that the chief executive of the HSE has indicated the assumptions underlying the health Estimate are no longer valid.

That Government poured hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money into the black hole of a financial system within the health service that was unable to deliver the services that our patients and people need.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Government have set our targets for spending in the health service and every other Department.  There will be no supplementary budget this year as the agreements set out last year must be achieved.  With the interim board of the HSE, the Minister is dealing with the matter, and we had some discussions about that last week.  It seems to me that Deputy Martin is exceptionally well briefed, even without the help of the Freedom of Information Act, but that is nothing new.

He must be aware of the letter from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who gave a lecture to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  He told the Minister for Health to take personal charge of this issue, so alarmed was he at the lack of governance-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	63	It was the Minister, Deputy Reilly, who abolished the board with great fanfare and trumpeting.  He put no alternative or substitute in place.  What we are currently experiencing is farcical.  There is no governance structure in place and there will not be one before the end of this year.  It is absolutely disgraceful.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	88	On issues where he has a clear policy, he wants them put to the convention.  On issues where he has no policy, he wants them dealt with just like that.  With regard to the health issue, agreements were made by the Government last year covering all Departments.  These were very tough and challenging, and they included the health area.  The health area has overrun, as it has done for many years, but there will be no supplementary budget.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	89	What about a Supplementary Estimate?

This is a very challenging time and I commend the clinical and medical teams, nurses and doctors who work on the front line.  They have made serious changes within the context of the Croke Park agreement to rosters, travel and giving commitments so that the patients about which the Deputy and I are concerned can have a front-line service in the best possible way.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Yesterday, I asked whether the Minister for Health would come to the Dáil and make a statement on his involvement with a private nursing home.  The Taoiseach gave this commitment and I welcome it.  I will not pass judgment on the Minister until I hear what he has to say on the issue.  However, there are questions for the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Health has failed to honour a High Court instruction.  Did the Taoiseach know this?  Did the Minister tell him or his colleagues in government that this was the case?  Did he tell the Taoiseach or his colleagues that he was to appear on the debtors defaulters list in Stubbs Gazette?The reality is the Minister has a personal investment in private health care and he is pursuing the Government policy of closing public nursing home beds.  Tá sé ag druid leapacha achan lá.  In the early part of this year, 296 public nursing home beds were closed.  I believe 600 elderly citizens in public hospital beds cannot be moved out of them because of the Government's policy, which is privatisation of the health service, just like Fianna Fáil before it.  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge this was all part of privatisation?  It is part of a tax scam for people to avoid paying tax by being given a ten year tax break for private nursing homes.  The Taoiseach said he has complete confidence in the Minister, Deputy Reilly; he would probably be expected to say this.  However, does the Taoiseach accept, in the interests of clarity, that there is a conflict of interest between the Minister's investment in private health and the closing of public nursing home beds?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	As Deputy Adams is well aware, the Minister sought permission from the Ceann Comhairle under Standing Order 44 to make a personal statement to the Dáil this evening and this he will do.  I point out to Deputy Adams that before he ever became a Minister, Deputy Reilly declared his interest in the nursing home in Greenhills, Carrick on Suir, dealing with the care of the elderly.  The public declaration in respect of his involvement in business also states interests were transferred to a blind trust as per advice from the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.Deputy Adams should honour what he said and wait until the Minister makes his statement to the House in respect of this.  Before he was ever pointed as a Minister he declared publicly, as per the requirements of the Standards in Public Office Commission, what were and are his business interests.  As Deputy Adams is aware, under the code of conduct for officeholders there is a requirement not to be involved in the direct management of business by being a director or whatever else.  These are matters that apply to all officeholders.  The Minister is quite happy to make a statement to the Dáil about this matter.I understand the judgment of the High Court is perfectly valid and the question for the group of investors is how to deal with it in terms of payment of the debt.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, happens to be one of those named investors.  As Deputy Adams is aware, he transferred his interest through power of attorney to a second legal person to deal with it at arm's length.  It is not for the Minister in such circumstances to ring up and state what he wants to do; it is a matter for the group of investors who have an interest in the premises not because of a tax scam, but through a tax break authorised by a previous Government in respect of the development of nursing homes and begun by the Deputy opposite when he was Minister with responsibility for health.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, will be in the House today to deal with the response to the Private Members' motion on health and has received permission from the Ceann Comhairle to make a personal statement subsequently under Standing Order 44.  This is the position.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The question I asked was for the Taoiseach.  I am prepared to wait until the Minister comes in to make a statement.  My question to the Taoiseach was whether he believes there is a conflict of interest and a contradiction if a Minister who has a private health investment is closing public health beds.  This was my question to the Taoiseach and he avoided it.  However, explicit in his answer is that he agrees there is no conflict of interest because he stated the Minister in question made it clear before he was appointed as a Minister, so the Taoiseach knew this, and therefore he thinks there is no problem whatsoever with one of the most senior Ministers, and deputy leader of his party, dealing with issues which affect every citizen in the State.  We know the health services are in a mess for all sorts of reasons, some of them legacy issues visited upon us by Fianna Fáil, but there is still a core ideological position in both parties of privatisation of the health service.  In his answer to my question, the Taoiseach accepted it is proper for a Minister to have a private investment element in his private wealth and also to be closing public nursing beds.  This is shameful.

Clearly, a number of changes are being made to the structure of the bed situation, both in the public and private sector throughout the country.I advise the Deputy, in the interest of everybody and of fairness, to listen to what the Minister has to say in his personal statement this evening, which has been approved by the Ceann Comhairle under Standing Orders.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Before the recess, the House is looking forward to the Taoiseach or the relevant Minister announcing a bank inquiry, which presumably will include the issue of the guarantee in 2008.  It is important that this inquiry has the right shape and protection.  I say this because last night the Committee of Public Accounts was forced to park an inquiry into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.  That inquiry was torpedoed through the combination of a letter from the chairman of the DDDA and a previous letter from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government stating there was a danger of the inquiry prejudicing a court case taking place currently.Oireachtas inquiries have a very poor record of coming to conclusions because vested interests have continuously been able to frustrate them by taking them, for one reason or another, to the Four Courts.  The Abbeylara inquiry, the CTC inquiry, the Judge Curtin inquiry, the Callely inquiry and now the DDDA investigation have all been frustrated because of legal threats.  I would like the Taoiseach to specify how he intends to subvert this danger with the bank inquiry when it is set up.  The danger for the bank inquiry is that rich bankers with great resources and ingenuity will be down in the Four Courts on day one attempting to frustrate it.  On the record of past inquiries, that is what is likely to happen.  Can the Taoiseach give the House some indication of how the Government intends to make this an effective inquiry that will not be frustrated by sometimes contrived visits to the Four Courts?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	153	This is an important matter and I agree with the Deputy that what must be done must be done correctly.  We have had the experience of inquiries, such as the DIRT inquiry and the Abbeylara inquiry.  We also have evidence from the Committee of Public Accounts where parties summoned to that committee to give information on particular issues refused to do so because of the lack of compellability of witnesses or personnel.  We held a referendum last year on the matter of inquiries and it was rejected by the people and I must respect that decision.The Committee of Public Accounts inquiry report produced recently is a 300 page document and is a comprehensive and substantial analysis of this matter and represents a great body of work the committee did over a long period.  This issue warrants serious and detailed analysis as to what is the best thing to do.  I have made it clear publicly previously that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will review any proposals received in respect of how to get at the fundamental truth of the issues with regard to the bank inquiry.  It is important to note that there is no evidence in the Department of the Taoiseach about the conversations and meetings that took place, the information in circulation or the rationale applied to it, before the Government of the day made a decision in respect of the bank guarantee.  No information was available to the Commission, Mr. Regling or the Governor of the Central Bank.  Banks visited Government Buildings and made their case.  As we know, an incorporeal meeting was held in the early hours of the morning on this matter.I do not want to take the wrong direction on this by having an inquiry that leads on interminably to a meaningless series of meetings that achieve nothing.  The Government will reflect on this carefully.  I have an open mind as to the nature and character of the Oireachtas committee that should look at this.  The report of the Committee of Public Accounts and any other observations will be reviewed carefully by the Minister, Deputy Howlin and he will bring a memo to Government on the issue and the Government will make a decision.  I am clear in my mind that any such inquiry should be to the point of decision of approval for the bank guarantee.  As Deputy Ross is well aware, the legal profession - good luck to it - has long experience of finding ways through what appear to be limited confines on inquiries.  We do no want a situation where the proposed inquiry might run for an extraordinary length of time and do not want a situation where we have writs flying all over the place because of the structure and nature of what might be involved here.This is a serious matter.  It was the biggest, single economic decision ever foisted on the backs of the Irish people and taxpayers.  From my perspective, I find it quite extraordinary that if I met the Bunclody Community Council, a series of people would be taking notes about the discussions held and the decisions arrived at, but with regard to this, the most significant financial decision ever taken in respect of our people, I have no evidence in the Department of the Taoiseach about who said what or the rationale applied to what was said before an incorporeal meeting was held in respect of that decision being foisted on the people.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Thank you.  We all support the need for this inquiry.  The point I was trying to make is this.  The House probably does not know that the Committee of Public Accounts, having been frustrated in its wish to investigate the DDDA in public, decided to look at the possibility of doing it in private, but yesterday, as a result of some fairly lukewarm legal advice and another letter from the chairman of the DDDA, it decided to park even that.Unless the Taoiseach and the Government impose extraordinarily strict criteria on potential witnesses, what hope is there of a full banking inquiry to get to the truth if they continuously rely on legal technicalities to get them out of this difficulty?  It is undoubtedly true that will be tried and used as soon as this inquiry is set up.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to put the maximum amount of pressure on not only the bankers, who will be reluctant to come before this inquiry, but on other people and other professions - I am talking about accountants, solicitors and others - who have received generous Government largesse to ensure that they do not frustrate an inquiry which is in the interests of the State?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	156	That is exactly why the decision to be taken has to be the right one and why the programme for Government set out a very clear strategy in a very clear way that the Government would hold a referendum asking the people this very question in order to deal with issues like this.  I respect the decision of the people.  They rejected the referendum and it leaves us in a position where we cannot proceed on the basis of what was set out as part of the programme for Government.  Clearly, if this matter is to be decided by way of an Oireachtas committee, legislation is required.I will not go any further at this point except to say that the Government will reflect very carefully on this.  It is in the interest of everybody that the truth is known in respect of the rationale applied to the information and the presentation made by banks to Government, for instance, and how the decision was taken.  We can debate this again but it is fundamentally important that the decision taken is the right one and that it does not lead to a situation where that frustration about which the Deputy spoke can be applied.  He will recall an inquiry into FÁS some time ago by the Committee of Public Accounts where people simply refused to turn up.  The decision arising from the Abbeylara case obviously restricted the opportunities for Oireachtas committees to do their job.  It is a matter which requires very careful consideration.  If any legislation is drafted, it will have to be drafted in direct consultation with the Attorney General in respect of what it actually means.

It is an issue of public interest and a very topical one.  I am sure the Taosieach would agree that if the shoe was on the other foot and it applied to a member of another party in government, the very least that would be required would be that questions would be answered and points clarified.  Our Whip was in touch with the Chief Whip and we should be facilitated in order to ensure the issue can be put to bed this evening.  I would also respectfully say that 9.55 p.m. is a most curious time to have the debate.

Any Member is entitled to apply to the Ceann Comhairle of the day to make a personal explanation.  The Minister in question applied to me and I have granted that request.  The Standing Order is quite clear.  If following on from that, Members wish to pursue the matter further, there is a method for doing so.  They can table a motion and there can be a debate.  Let us get this straight.  What has been asked for and what has been granted is time for a personal explanation and that is it.Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10a, motion re Membership of Committee, without debate, agreed to?  Agreed.  Is proposal for dealing with No. 18, Report and Final Stages of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 agreed to?  Agreed.

Every year, demographic funding has been provided to ensure that children who have intellectual disabilities can get places after the school term has ended.  No such guarantee is in place this year.  Families are being notified within the next few days as to whether or not there will be places for them.The Taoiseach has indicated that the HSE governance Bill will not be published until the autumn.  The education and training boards Bill may provide a facility to correct this issue, which is causing grave distress to families throughout the country.A child who does not have an intellectual disability would be guaranteed a school place.  People with intellectual disabilities are being deprived of places and their situations are being placed in grave doubt and uncertainty.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Deputies will be familiar with this Bill which has been through all Stages in the Dáil and Seanad.  An amendment was proposed in the Seanad and I wish to outline the reason for that.As I explained when I presented the Bill to the House last autumn, the amendments proposed in the Bill can be divided into two broad strands.  The first strand derives from the relatively broad definition of the practice of veterinary medicine in the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 and the need to ensure that certain ancillary activities and services concerning animals which have traditionally been carried out safely by non-veterinary surgeons or nurses do not become the preserve of the veterinary profession.  The legal advice obtained by my Department is that having regard to the existing definition of veterinary practice in the Act, there could be doubt as to the status of these procedures carried out on animals, particularly in the event of legal disputes arising.  The procedures I have in mind include farriery, equine dentistry, bovine hoof trimming, microchipping of companion animals, scanning of cattle and sheep and physiotherapy.  This list is not exhaustive and it may be appropriate at some time in the future to include other procedures on the exemption list.In summary, I am proposing to resolve the legal difficulty by inserting provisions into the Act to enable me or any future Minister, under delegated powers to make regulations to exempt certain procedures from being reserved to vets or veterinary nurses.  In exercising these regulation making powers I will be subject to the principles and policies set down in the Bill.  The Bill also provides for formal consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland before any activity is exempted.  There will be extensive consultation with the various stakeholders before any regulations are adopted.The second strand of the Bill relates to changes being proposed to streamline and improve the operation of the 2005 Act in light of the experience since its implementation in January 2006.  In the majority of cases, the changes proposed derive from suggestions put forward by the Veterinary Council of Ireland based on its direct experience of implementing the 2005 Act.    The proposed amendment also takes account of more recent legislation governing the regulation of the professions, including in particular the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Pharmacy Act 2007.  The Bill has to come back to the Dáil because the Seanad approved an amendment to section 91 of the 2005 Act.  The amendment of section 9(o) of the Bill comes as a result of representations by the veterinary profession subsequent to its passage through this House and is designed to clarify and update the particular aspects of veterinary practice which veterinary nurses are permitted to carry out.The amendment comprises three aspects.  First, it clarifies what nurses may do by way of minor surgery.  Some stakeholders believe the existing definition in section 91(3) of the Act could be open to misunderstanding.  The revised definition, which is intended to clarify rather than expand or restrict the range of specific functions nurses may undertake by way of minor surgery, has been arrived at following detailed consultations with concerned parties, including the Veterinary Council and the UCD veterinary faculty.  Second, it is designed to afford nurses greater latitude in administering certain forms of treatment.  Currently these treatments can only be administered by a nurse while in the presence of a vet.  Given the higher level of confidence between the two professions and the improved training of nurses since the adoption of the 2005 Act, the amendment enables nurses to administer the treatments when the overseeing vet is not physically present.  This should facilitate more effective management of clinical situations.  Third, it clarifies the terminology in the Act relating to the functions that nurses may perform in the context of sedating animals in preparation for surgery and post-operative situations.The proposed amendment reflects careful consideration and wide consultation.  It is consistent with the overall thrust of the Bill, which is to permit procedures to be conducted by a competent person.  It is also intended to facilitate the further development of the veterinary nursing profession, working in collaboration with their veterinary practitioner colleagues.  I hope the House will agree that the amendment is in the interest not only of the nursing profession but also of bringing services to animal owners on a cost effective basis while ensuring the appropriate level of quality assurance.This Bill has been a positive exercise in terms of Opposition input and I would like to think the Government has taken on board the concerns expressed in the Seanad and the Dáil.  I hope Deputies will be able to support this final amendment and I commend it to the House.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I have no objection to the amendment.  The Bill regulates the procedures that can be performed by veterinarians and veterinary nurses.  As animal medicine evolves, it is important that regulations can be revised by means of secondary legislation rather than primary legislation.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Sinn Féin supports the amendment but I wish to raise a point of clarification for the Minister.  As veterinary technology and training improve, the number and range of procedures that can be performed by those who are not vets will continue to expand.  Would it not be preferable to include the list of exempted procedures as a Schedule to the Bill rather than in the Bill itself?  The inclusion of the procedures within the Bill means that the inevitable expansion of the procedures covered will have to be debated in the Dáil.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	210	We had a lengthy discussion on this issue in the Seanad in order to provide clarity on the various procedures that do not require the presence of a vet.  In other words, a farmer or other competent person will be able to undertake certain procedures in the absence of a vet.  The Bill deliberately does not set out the procedures in question because the list may change.  However, it provides for a legal structure which enables the list to be expanded by ministerial order or statutory instrument.  The list is compiled in consultation with representative bodies, including the IFA and the Veterinary Council, and any other stakeholders who wish to be part of that process.  We will consult widely before extending the list that will be put in place with the enactment of this Bill.  It would not make much sense for the Bill to itemise the precise procedures because we do not want to introduce amending legislation to change the list.  By giving the power to the Minister to change the list, he or she will be able to incorporate new procedures which could, for example, be performed by veterinary nurses or a competent farmer.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I bring to the attention of the House for its approval the technical amendment introduced on Report Stage in the Seanad last week to amend section 5(5) of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012.  The amendment removes the provision relating to powers of the Minister to amend or revoke a scheme under section 5.  This is an inherent power to amend or revoke a statutory instrument under section 22(3) of the Interpretation Act 2005.  Accordingly, there is no need for the revocation provision to be included in the Bill and its removal was suggested by Parliamentary Counsel.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 8, line 25, to delete "Act 1965." and substitute the following:"Act 1965;(d) section 6 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963;(e) section 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963;(f) section 78 of the Local Government (Superannuation)(Consolidation) Scheme 1998.”.This amendment seeks, in section 3, to include the repeal of sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963, along with section 78 of the Local Government (Superannuation)(Consolidation) Scheme 1998.I have had an ongoing debate with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but, sadly, to no avail in respect of addressing not just future pension entitlements, but also current ones, and in particular those enjoyed by persons at the upper end of the service, such as current Secretaries General and county managers.  The Minister, who has now joined us, has promised to deal with these matters but he has not done so as yet.  I am therefore proposing this amendment as the manner in which those very large pension pots would be finally dealt with.  The wording suggests including the repeal of sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 and section 78 of the Local Government (Superannuation)(Consolidation) Scheme 1998.The Minister has said for quite some time that he will deal with the issue pertaining to county managers but he has not yet done so.  We have had a long debate about this matter.  I have asked the Minister to deal with the pension pots of current Secretaries General and the really indefensible pension arrangements they currently enjoy.  I am asking him to accept this amendment as a concrete way of finally resolving this issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I apologise in advance for the fact that I will be absent for the first hour or so of this debate.  There is a scheduled meeting of the implementation body of the Croke Park agreement with the Taoiseach.  I have been preparing for that and will be going there immediately.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will follow the debate and I hope Members will accept that.We dealt with this amendment at some length on Committee Stage.  The provisions are intended to deal with exceptional situations and their application requires ministerial sanction.  As was said on Committee Stage, the repeal of sections 6 and 7 of the 1963 Act, which is implicit in the proposal, could only have prospective effect.  I explained this in some detail to Deputy McDonald at the time and I think she understands that we cannot have a retrospective impact on the people we are talking about.This legislation is creating a new framework for the future.  These provisions not only apply to Secretaries General and the like, but they were also the basis for the terms offered in the general voluntary early retirement scheme in the Civil Service, which in certain circumstances allowed up to seven years' severance payments.The House will be aware that, on my recommendation, the Government has already introduced a brand new regime to apply to Secretaries General.  The Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, terms, which had been in place since 1987, were fundamentally altered within a matter of months of this Government taking office and my Department being established.  Those very generous terms that applied in good times and bad - because we went through some difficult times post-1987 - have been altered.  There is a new, much fairer system in place for all appointments.At Question Time last week, I indicated the list of new appointments made to Secretary General rank since those new terms have been applied.  A Secretary General's term of office is only seven years, so over a relatively short period they will work themselves out of the system.  However, we cannot reach back legally to others.  I know the Deputy has already debated this with me, but that is the advice I have received and I have laid it out fairly.  We are changing the regime so that in future it will be a much fairer one.The whole import of this Bill is to have one comprehensive piece of legislation that deals with everybody in a fair way.  Fast accruals are implicit in this legislation because there are certain categories of work - for instance, the Garda Síochána or the Army - that will require that.  I am also applying a relatively fast accrual to Members of the Oireachtas because of the nature of the job here.  I am afraid that people have to reapply frequently and the employers sometimes do not see fit to accept one's application.The new system is much fairer, however.  Where there is fast accrual, in each circumstance under this new regime, there will be a concomitant significant increase in the contribution paid.  The single scheme, therefore, will be a better and much more transparent system.  The component parts of it are fair.As regards the specific points the Deputy has made, we will come back to that in a different context, but it cannot be dealt with in the way that she is suggesting here.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I will make a short response because we have debated this at length.  The Minister says he has received legal advice, which he has articulated.  I assume it is from the Attorney General.  I know it is not common practice, but it would be useful if the Minister would simply publish that advice to illuminate my position further.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	216	It is not the practice to publish such advice and it is not my intention to do so.  I have given the advice verbally.  There are any number of eminent legal advisers available to the Deputy if she feels that countervailing advice is required.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	217	It is the Minister's advice that counts because he makes the decisions based upon it.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Amendment No. 2 is out of order.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Amendments Nos. 3 and 12 are related and will be discussed together by agreement.  As none of the Members, in whose name amendment No. 3 is tabled are present we will move on.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Amendment No. 12 seeks to remove the subsection which provides, with some exceptions, for an obligatory retirement age of 70 years for public servants.Sinn Féin has consistently opposed any ratcheting up of the age at which a person would have the right to claim a State pension.  We do not want people forced to work into their sixties and beyond if they chose not to do so for whatever reason.  We believe people are entitled to their pension at the age of 65 years.  We equally oppose the rigid provision whereby the vast majority of public servants would be forced to retire at the age of 70.  A person should have a right to his or her pension age but not an obligation to down tools at the age of 70 years.  Curiously, the legislation allows for some exceptions in this regard.   For example, a Member of this House can work beyond 70 years.  This provision is arbitrary and discriminatory.In an age when people are living longer and some are fit and well and wish to continue to work at 70 years and beyond there should be no legal impediment to their doing so.  However, I do not wish this to be confused with the issue of entitlement to pension at the age of 65 years.  I ask that the Minister of State accept this amendment.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I am speaking from the notes provided to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who apologises for not being here.The difficulty that arises is that currently there is no upper age limit set.  This legislation seeks to put in place a limit.  As already stated by the Minister, this provision will not apply to people already in the system.  Deputy McDonald has discussed at length the differential between Members of the Oireachtas and other workers.  However, this provision seeks to address the lack of security and tenure of employment for Members of the Oireachtas.  The age of 70 years is the upper limit.  No one will be prevented from retiring at a lower age.  It is important that there are clear guidelines in place in this regard.  For instance, for staff recruited before 2004 a maximum retirement age of 65 years generally applies.The Bill proposes a maximum retirement age of 70 years for single scheme members, except for certain elected officeholders and positions such as the President and Oireachtas Members.  I understand the argument which the Deputy makes.  However, I do not accept the notion that any of us would be so successful as to continue to be re-elected well into our seventies.  It is accepted that there should be no age limit, other than the lower one, in respect of the President.This is a new scheme.  We all know people who would wish to continue in employment beyond the age of 65 years.  There is nothing in the Bill which prevents people retiring at an earlier age.  I am unable to accept the Deputy's amendment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	223	We will deal with the question on this amendment later.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Before we move on, I would like to deal with a drafting error in the Bill in respect of which the Minister had not been briefed earlier.In accordance with Standing Order 140, I ask that the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to make the following change to the Bill.  In page 32, the last three lines should be indented so that it is clear that they only refer to paragraph (b) which starts on line 13.  It is a technical amendment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 have been ruled out of order.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 19, to delete lines 1 to 8.The stated purpose of this scheme is to have a universal system for new entrants, in which there is merit.  It makes administrative sense and there is a sense of equity, if one gets the scheme right, in a single scheme.  However, the amendment seeks to delete the subsection under which special provision for Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament is made.  I would like struck from the Bill the notion that somebody who has been elected to the Oireachtas or European Parliament at some stage would not, should he or she re-enter as an elected representative, be subject to the new scheme but rather would enjoy the old scheme.  I believe this flies in the face of the logic of having a single unified pension scheme.  It marks the differential between elected Members, be it to the Oireachtas or European Parliament, which I do not believe is fair.I appreciate that we regularly interview for our jobs.  Some of us have had the experience of not cutting the mustard in particular interviews and of all the challenges of political life.  However, we opt for that.  I do not believe that a fair argument has been made as to why we should be treated differently.  It would be far better and in our interests as elected public officials to be treated equally and to be seen to be treated equally.  Amendment No. 6 seeks to strike that particular subsection from the legislation.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The amendment seeks the deletion of the subsection which provides that former or current Oireachtas Members shall not be members of the single scheme.  I reiterate what the Minister had to say at the opening of this debate, namely, that we cannot legislate retrospectively in these matters.  The Government decided that the single pension scheme should extend to new or first time Members of the Oireachtas and officeholders, including Ministers and Ministers of State.  However, unlike almost all public servants Oireachtas Members do not have security of tenure and are subject to the will of the electorate.  There can be a considerable change in Oireachtas membership from one Dáil or Seanad to the next.  The requirement to be re-elected from time to time means that Oireachtas Members are different to the general body.  I accept that we do opt for this life.  However, I have often made the point that most people opt for the job they do and as such I do not believe that we are that different.  The nature of our work may be different but how we get here is not in my view entirely different.  This special factor is taken into account in the Bill for serving or former Oireachtas Members and Ministers.  Accordingly, in the case of a Member of the Oireachtas and officeholder who was first elected or appointed before this Bill becomes law, he or she will be a member of the single scheme in respect of any future service as an Oireachtas Member.  This is considered a reasonable exception on the basis that a Deputy, Senator or Minister may not be re-elected and consequently does not have the same security of tenure as do other public servants.  The argument in respect of this provision was made on Second and Committee Stages.  We will not be accepting the amendment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Amendment No. 7 is out of order.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 19, to delete lines 42 to 45.This matter was discussed in great detail on Committee Stage.  We want to delete the provision allowing the Minister to end the pension, which we believe is wrong.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	230	We will not be accepting the amendment.  As Deputy McDonald has already said, this will come as no great surprise.  This matter was well thrashed out on Committee Stage.  We cannot allow a Minister - either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform - not to have this power.  While the power already exists, it is not used in any way to ensure people do not get their entitlements.  In all my years here I have not seen it used in that way.  It is a power the Minister should have and already has.  From time to time there are changes in allowances.  That is basically what this power is and it will continue to be that.  We will not be accepting the amendment.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 19, after line 45, to insert the following:"(5) The Minister shall publish a full list of allowances which shall be classed as pensionable under the scheme.".Section 11 deals with the issue of pensionability of allowances, emoluments and related payments.  On Committee Stage I tabled a simple amendment asking the Minister to publish the full list of allowances which are classed as pensionable under the scheme.  The Minister did not do that on Committee Stage.  He has had the opportunity to do it since and I look forward to the Minister sending me the list so that I can withdraw the amendment.  If I receive that I will be happy to do so, but if not I will be back in a moment.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	232	It is very difficult to see the Opposition being happy - I have been there and I do not think that is its job.  The Minister and his officials are working on the list as was explained on Committee Stage.  That list is not fully formed yet.  I do not believe there will be a difficulty as soon as the list is completed.  It is not normal, but I do not think there will be a difficulty.  The list simply is not completed yet.  As the Deputy has probably gathered, in the past year and the previous year when the Deputy's party was in control, the number of allowances and the variances in them are substantial.  Some of them would even surprise the Opposition.  As the list is not completed, it is not possible to comply with what the Deputy requests.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I ask the Ceann Comhairle to indulge me for a few moments on this amendment.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I am afraid so.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	In that case we might have to deal with it in a different way and take 20 minutes by way of a division if I am not allowed enough time to speak under Standing Orders.  I had asked the Minister for a response and had expected to get a response but did not.  We should not be asked to pass legislation on pensionable allowances when we do not know the allowances to which they relate.  Last week I tabled parliamentary questions and have received replies listing hundreds of allowances on a Department-by-Department basis.  It makes no sense for the Government to claim it does not have the list.  While I know the list may not be definitive, it is available to the Government and has not been discussed with anyone.  It might help the Minister of State if I provided her with the list I got from each Department that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will not provide to the House.  I cannot let the matter go given that there are hundreds of allowances which should be read into the record if the Minister will not provide it.I wanted the opportunity to do so but apparently I cannot do that now.  I would have done so at my first opportunity.  Given that the information was given in responses to parliamentary questions last week, it was reasonable for me to assume the Minister of State had the list.  I am shocked that she does not have the list or that the Minister does not even intend giving the list.  It shows gross disrespect to the House on the part of the Minister to claim he does not have the list when I have it here.  It was well covered in the newspapers last week.  Shame on the Department that cannot publish the list that was published in the newspapers last week.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Shame on a Deputy who makes assumptions without listening to the reply.  The Deputy may refer to the fact that Departments were able to publish lists of allowances payable.  It is certainly true that they published lists of allowances payable in each Department.  These are Civil Service allowances, many of which are personal to holders and therefore would not have been payable to new beneficiaries - for example the children's allowance which is only payable to those in the Civil Service.  On 1 January 1978 the Civil Service comprised only 10% of the public service.  The allowances review covers all public service allowances and is therefore a wider exercise.  Shame on the Deputy for jumping to conclusions.  It is an awful pity he did not know about his first contribution.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Deputy is now entitled to a final reply on the amendment.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The parliamentary questions did specifically ask about the health sector, the defence sector and the local government sector.  The replies to the parliamentary questions are more comprehensive than just covering Departments.  The list I have is fairly complete and broader.  I asked for the details of allowances paid through local authorities and I accept that some of that information has not yet been provided.  I have asked the Minister to compile it and send it on to me, and it will come in due course.  I was giving the Department the benefit of the doubt in my first contribution as I assumed the officials would have had it here.  I have lost my opportunity to-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	245	No, the Deputy has not.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Is there a limit on this?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	247	No.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I will not indulge you too long, a Cheann Comhairle.  I want to outline some of the allowances.  Approximately 20 allowances are being paid in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The list from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade includes the child allowance, to which the Minister of State referred, for people who were in the public service before a set period, which does not apply.  However, it also contains a van-driver allowance, franking machine allowance, keyholder allowance, paper-keeper allowance, shoe allowance, switchboard allowance, unsocial hours allowance, diplomatic duty allowance and passport office allowance.  The list continues for five pages.  The Department of Finance list includes delegates allowance, higher duty allowance, machine allowance, special variable allowance, keyholder allowance, telephonist allowance, child allowance, retro higher duty allowance, retro special allowance, retro private secretary allowance, retro local post allowance tax-free.The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform list contains allowance personal to holder, child allowance again, maternity allowance, private secretary allowance and special allowance.  There are not too many in that Department, which is a relatively new Department.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation list also refers to child allowance.  I am not dealing with the ones for private secretaries.  We understand the allowances for staff on duty on weekends.  I said here last week that many allowances and increments are part of pay - I have no argument with that.  I was only asking for a list of what we are discussing.  I am one of the few people in the House who will stand up for the public service in pensionable payment allowances.  There are also footwear allowance, delegate allowance, cost of living allowance, child foreign allowance, local post allowance and school fees allowance.  I also submitted separate parliamentary questions on the school allowances paid in separate Departments.The Department of Social Protection list includes telephone rental allowance, keyholder allowance, Gaeltacht allowance, dual responsibility allowance, cleaning allowance, training allowance, travel allowance, personal to the holder allowance and special investigation unit allowance.  Obviously being in the special investigation unit of the Department of Social Protection can be a very difficult job, operating out of hours.  An officer could be - I will not say on surveillance work - working with other State authorities.I accept some of these jobs could be difficult and could involve a certain risk for the individual.  I fully support some of these allowances and would defend them to the last but some of them are outdated and should no longer be in place.In every Department there is a franking machine allowance.  In the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government there is a shift allowance, a PCW allowance, a special duty allowance, a met station officer allowance, a children's allowance, a photocopying allowance, a driving allowance, an office accommodation allowance and an eating on site allowance - this is granted where there is no canteen available.  A person gets €1.75 tax free for having their lunch while sitting at their desk.  One can discuss the merits of that separately, I am simply putting the allowances on record.  I asked for the list of allowances paid by the local authorities where there are 30,000 staff and was advised that the list will be provided separately.The Minister for Justice and Equality advised that there is a higher duties allowance, a paperkeeper allowance, a supervisor allowance, a driving allowance, a footwear allowance, an out of call allowance and various other allowances payable to the Minster's staff with which I have no problem.  They are entitled to it, they earn and put in long hours.In regard to the Department of Defence, I do not want to overdo what I say about the allowances there.  I got into a good deal of trouble talking about the Border duty allowance.  I tabled a separate question to establish if that allowance is in place.  I have been criticised by colleagues and have received telephone calls about that.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Yes, exactly.  As soon as this reply appeared last week, I received telephone calls at my constituency office in Castletown from Donegal and everywhere else asking what was I talking about.  I said that I merely published the Minister's reply to the question and I made no comment.  In regard to the Department of Defence, I am sure the Air Traffic Control officer's allowance is well justified.  There is an editors' connect and An Cosantoir allowance, an election gratuity allowance - I do not know what that is for - an emergency medical allowance and an explosive ordnance duty allowance.  The people who do ordnance work are certainly entitled to an allowance.  In respect of many of these allowances I would fight for the people who have them to retain them but I would like to able to specify which is which.  There is a fire protection pay allowance, an instructor's allowance, a special instructor's allowance, an Irish language teaching allowance, an isolated outpost allowance, a military service allowance, a technician pay allowance, a security duty allowance, a daily course allowance, a messing allowance - I presume that is for working in the Army mess, perhaps they eat at a lower table than the others, I do not know what that allowance is for - and a uniform replenishment allowance.  I will not go into the latter allowance.  The journalists asked me to specify the difference between a male officer allowance and a female officer allowance but I will leave that to others to talk about.  Then is a long list setting out a trainee pilot allowance and the list goes on.  I advise the Minister of State that I getting through this information.  The  few minutes I spend putting these allowances on the record, once I get them on it, might save me calling a vote.The allowances in the Department of Defence, as opposed to the Defence Forces - I got details of the allowances not only in respect of the Department but in respect of the Army - include a Sunday allowance, a holiday allowance, a Saturday allowance, a wardsmaid's allowance, a kitchen and mess helper wardsmaid's allowance for bank holidays, and on call allowance in Haulbowline, about which the Minister of State will be pleased to hear.  The on-call allowance in Haulbowline is €211.85 per week and it is taxable while the call out call allowance in Baldonnel is only €21.98 and it is also taxable.  There is also a tool allowance, an oil allowance, a pumps allowance, a storekeeper's allowance and an eating on site allowance.  That allowance for staff in that Department eating at their desks is €1.90 a day whereas it is €1.67 a day in other Departments.In the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine there is an allowance playable to veterinary officers who work in rendering plants.  None of us would want to have to spend our time in such plants and we know the difficult conditions that exist in some of them.  There is a shift allowance, a 1% PCW allowance, which I presume was in one of the national pay agreements, a housing allowance, an assisted head service officer allowance, a footwear allowance, an on-call allowance, and an eating on site allowance, which is only payable to general operatives and craft workers.  It is €1.90 in line with that of the previous Department to which I referred.  There is a meat inspection allowance, a pesticide allowance, an allowance to farm managers at Longtown Farm - I am not sure where that is - a livestock allowance and allowances for taking samples at knackeries, which is not a nice job.  Those workers earn their allowance.In regard to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, there is a modest set of allowances for this new Department, with which I would have no issue.  In regard to the Department of Health, there is a modified rate full allowance and I will not go into the allowances paid to consultants.  I presume they are not included in the list in the reply I received but they are the ones we should be talking about.  In the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport there is a range of allowances that are quite small, including a radio officer allowance, a station allowance, an on-call allowance and a marine survey allowance, all of which I am sure are well earned.A list of the allowances in the health sector will be forwarded to me later.  The Department could have produced a list.  I accept it was not provided and that there is work to be done on it.  It would be helpful to have such a list when the Dáil is passing legislation that deals specifically with allowances.  We are being asked to pass legislation on the blind.  If the Minister of State or I were to go for an interview this afternoon and we were asked what allowances were included in the legislation we had passed on public service pensions and other related matters, which include allowances, neither she nor I would know the answer to that question.  We should not be passing legislation when that is the bottom line of what we are doing here.My point has been well made.  We will return to the issue of allowances in several other forms in this House but the way we are dealing with the issue here is not the right way .  The Minister should have held over this section until his review of allowances was completed, whether that be next week, next month or next November.  When he has the review of allowances and work is being done on a budget for next year - this will relate to new recruits by and large - at that stage we would have the exact list of allowances that are permanent, payable and taxable and they should be included under the pension scheme.  Those allowances that are temporary or past their sell-by date should no longer exist and they should be abolished if that is the business case that needs to be made.  At that stage we should incorporate the allowances into legislation.  It is wrong that we are passing legislation in respect of a list of allowances about which nobody knows the detail.  That is not good legislation.  My point is well made and I will return to it.

In my opening remarks I said there are so many allowances that it is difficult to know what they are.  The review is ongoing.  The Minister knew that this issue would arise and he has said that when the review is completed and presented to the Government he will have no difficulty in publishing it at that stage.  The Deputy read an exhaustive list of allowances but it is only a fraction of those available.  I agree with him that there are allowances which are quite moderate and that people richly deserve.  They probably deserve higher allowances but in the current circumstances that will not happen in the near future.  On the other hand, there are allowances in place that are a hangover from practices that occurred a long time ago and the notion that power would be removed from the Minister to make decisions on those allowances, which was the subject of the previous amendment, seems ludicrous.  I agree with the Deputy's main point.  I hope he will not take any offence at what I said earlier - I would not mean that to be the case.

In page 23, after line 45, to insert the following:"(10) Scheme members shall be entitled to purchase years of notional service and the Minister shall publish purchase tables and the rate of contribution for notional service before the enactment of this Act.".The Minister of State will appreciate what I am proposing in this amendment.  We raised this matter on Committee Stage, had a discussion on it and that is the reason I have tabled the amendment.  The amendment proposes that scheme members or public servants who are part of a pension scheme shall be entitled to purchase years of notional service and the Minister shall publish purchase tables and the rate of contribution for notional service before the enactment of this Act.  The Minister of State will appreciate that many people who have taken a career break may not have their full 40 years' service on reaching retirement, which was the requirement in the past prior to the new legislation being introduced.  Teachers may have worked abroad or may have been late in entering the profession.They may now only make up 30 years but they want to contribute in order to buy extra years to give them the equivalent of a full pension on retirement.  They are forced to take out additional voluntary contributions purchased from private sector pension schemes and we all know how these have performed in recent times.  Many of these pension schemes have invested abroad there has been a reduction in the returns.Teachers have been concerned about this issue over a number of years.  Like everyone who takes out an AVC, they note the commission charged by these companies means the full first year of contributions is to pay the commission charges.  The companies take the 5% commission on the 20 years of the contribution in the first year.  The value of the AVC fund after the first year or two might be in the negative because of the level of commission charged.  Current public servants are outraged that if they decide to increase the value of their pension on retirement they must go to the private sector.  Some companies provide special arrangements for different categories of public servants such as gardaí, teachers or nursing staff.  Also, there is no security as to what they will receive and this is also the case for private sector employees.  However, these workers are public servants.  They are paid by the State and they ask why their contributions cannot be invested by the State over the period rather than the State handing that money over to the private sector on behalf of its employees who have paid for AVCs.My amendment contains a reasonable request for the Minister to consider publishing the table so that people would know what they would have on retirement.  I ask the Minister to outline the rate of contributions and the notional benefit to be received.  It may not be incorporated in this legislation but in this day and age of the State's cash flow difficulties the cost of AVCs is being deducted from public servants' salary payments and is being handed over to private companies.  I suggest it would be more sensible for the State to hold that money, put it to use during this difficult economic period and pay the person the contribution on retirement.  I suggest that the State should be the beneficiary of the contributions in the short term.  The process of augmenting pensions has been privatised.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	257	This Bill does not deal with AVCs which are private sector products that are already heavily regulated.  The information contained in a table and which applies to teachers was distributed on Committee Stage and I hope it was of some assistance to Deputies.  The Deputy has taken a sensible decision to make the argument rather than to table an amendment specifically dealing with this issue which could be moved out of order as being a potential charge on the Exchequer.  The Deputy has chosen a novel but very clever way of debating amendments.The Deputy will understand that the amendment No. 14 as he has tabled it, is not acceptable to the Minister.  On the proposal that a notional service purchase option be included, the Minister points out that the single scheme is based on accrual of money amounts towards pension and lump sum and so it effectively represents a discontinuance of service as a measure of superannuation entitlement.  In short, the scheme is counting reckonable amounts, that is, money, not years of service or notional service - this is a very clear difference - and would therefore be incompatible with the fundamental designs of the new scheme to insert a service-based element in respect of purchase of benefits and accordingly, the Minister, is not in a position to accept the amendment.  However, I appreciate the Deputy's arguments.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I formulated the amendment in such a way as to raise the issue for debate and clarify the points.  It is a way of asking the Minister to publish the purchase tables.  I agree that information on the notional service purchase scheme for teachers, dated September 2011, was provided on Committee Stage.  I note there is a limit to the number of notional years a person may purchase.  For example, a person with 15 years' service on retirement will be permitted to buy a maximum of nine years.  A person with ten years' service, therefore, cannot purchase 30 years.  It is a case of supplementing rather than a full provision of a pension.  The current arrangements for teachers are good.  There is nothing to prevent other Departments from adopting such arrangements for current staff who are paying for AVCs.  I ask if a similar arrangement could be implemented in due course for such staff when the new scheme is up and running.  I will not press the amendment.  I am happy to have raised the point and some progress has been made on this issue.

In page 25, line 9, to delete "year for the pension, and" and substitute the following:"year for the pension, that amounts to no more than €60,000, and".This boils down to a straightforward proposition, that the pension payable to a public servant would be capped at €60,000.  The amendments I have tabled propose to alter the legislation at various junctures to reiterate that point.Some might argue that to introduce such a cap is a crude instrument.  It is a blunt instrument, but it is also one that has the merit of equity and transparency.  The Minister will be aware of the public disquiet and debate that arose in the not too distant past about the pension pots senior civil servants, former politicians and former Ministers were receiving.  Those sums of money would be indefensible at any time but at a time when the State is insolvent and is a programme country, where cuts and austerity policies are damaging citizens and communities, it is utterly farcical for that situation to continue.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, told me his advice is that he cannot tamper with the pension entitlements of a range of senior personnel because the new provisions cannot have retrospective effect.  I debated that with him and asked him to publish the legal advice.  He failed to do so and, no doubt, my debate with him on that matter will continue.What we are seeking with these amendments is a capped figure for the future.  It is a reasonable figure of €60,000 as a maximum pension pay out for public and civil servants.  That is the fair way to lead in a time of economic crisis, and I commend it to the Minister.  I will not go through each of the amendments which apply to various provisions in the legislation, but the essential thrust is to clearly state that the pension take of senior public and civil servants can extend thus far and no further.  It is also important to put it on the record that vast numbers of people who work very hard in the civil and public service will never have a hope of securing a pension of that order.  It would be far beyond what they would be entitled to, so the cap I am suggesting in this provision is unapologetically aimed at those in the upper echelons who have, to this point, received excessive pay-outs and pension pots.It is something that must be dealt with.  The Minister says he cannot I do it retrospectively and I hope the Minister of State will not say that not only can it not be done retrospectively but it cannot be done into the future either.  I hope that is not the Government's position.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I second the amendment.  I will simply reiterate the point made by Deputy McDonald.  People are scandalised by top civil servants and politicians walking away with obscene pension pots when the rest of the country is being crucified by austerity and cuts.  It is particularly galling, as the Minister will be aware, that some of the people whom many would hold responsible for the current economic crisis are walking away with obscene pension pots while ordinary people are left to pick up the tab for the reckless behaviour that took place.  Sinn Féin's proposal to cap pension entitlements at €60,000 per year is very reasonable.The Minister has indicated that the problem with this is technical in nature, that is, in terms of what €60,000 will mean a few years hence.  I do not accept that as a reason to oppose the amendment.  The Minister can always adjust the figure upwards as time goes on.  It would be a relatively easy thing to do.  The Minister has given himself discretion in other matters relating to the new scheme so I do not see why the figure could not be updated as time passes.  It would go some way to showing a serious commitment on the part of the Government to do something about these enormous pension pots of top public servants.  In addition, although it is not directly related to the amendment, I do not accept that we cannot do this to some of the people who have walked away because there are other ways of doing it if there is a will.  The tax system could be used to go after some of the enormous pension pots that some people have walked away with if there was a will to do so.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	264	To take the Deputy's last point, where there is a will, hopefully there will be an amendment.  In this case there was none from the Deputies to do this retrospectively.  The retrospective issue is the difficulty, as Deputy McDonald knows.  There is huge difficulty with retrospection.  People come into an employment with a particular contract.  They have an expectation of what the benefits will be as a result of that employment, so one cannot retrospectively damage that contract.It is important that the Minister has introduced a cap of 50% of the final payment.  It is probably the type of index linking the Deputies are seeking.  The amendment introduces a specific payment of €60,000.  People entering the service now at the levels people entered in the past means we are talking about 30 to 40 years hence.  There will be many legislative measures passed between now and then.  It is reasonable to assume that the sum of €60,000 in 20, 30 or 40 years will not be a great deal of money.  That is also important.The Minister does not accept the amendment.  The sentiment behind it is fully understood.  Deputies on this side of the House are very conscious of how the public feels about things that are seen to be excessive.  Hopefully, those days are gone and this legislation is part and parcel of the process of putting more equity back into the system.  The amendments specify €60,000 for one group and €37,000 for another group.  I am not defending myself in this instance but talking about equity, and if somebody has the same level of service, has made the contribution and in some instances paid a lot more with the faster accruing contributions, I do not understand the amendments from that point of view.  What the Minister has done is very reasonable.  When a legislative measure is before the House one must assume it will last the distance and in this case we are talking about people who might very well be collecting those pensions 30, 40 or 50 years hence.  Putting a cap of 50% of the final salary in the legislation is probably as crude and blunt an instrument as the Deputy mentioned but it is a far more equitable one.  We will not accept the amendment.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	265	This is one of these old chestnuts that arise when one comes forward with a proposal to deal with the issues.  I am focusing very specifically on the pension entitlements of very high earners because this is where the problem lies.  Nobody in the world has an issue with public servants who have served their time and who have served their communities and the State being entitled to decent pensions; this is not a matter of controversy at all.  As the Minister of State acknowledges, such staff are, for the most part, entitled to very modest pension coverage.  The problem is with the upper echelons.  The Minister of State said, "Where there is a will, there is an amendment".  This is a very good phrase and it is quite correct.  I introduced an amendment on the retrospection issue.  We debated it and the Minister blew it out of the water on the basis of legal advice that he will not publish.There is merit associated with caps.  A cap was much trumpeted in respect of CEOs of semi-State companies.  The figure in question was much greater than €60,000.  A figure of €200,000 is referred to in respect of the Civil Service.  While one might disagree with caps on the grounds that one must calculate what €200,000 will be worth in a given number of years, one must acknowledge that a cap, because it specifies a definite figure, represents the most effective and transparent approach.  Of course, one must factor in what €60,000 will be worth in ten years.  There are ways we can address that.  The Bill envisages a system of linkage to the consumer price index, and this constitutes one method.  There would be solutions if there were a will to accept an initiatives such as the one I propose.  However, the Minister of State is not accepting my amendments so I can only draw the conclusion that there is no political will to have the kind of cap I propose.  I intend to return to this matter and debate it vigorously with the Government.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Calculating 50% of one's final salary is a much cleaner approach.  The figure of €60,000 would have to be returned to time and again because, no matter what condition the country is in 20 years from now, constant review will be required.  If one applies a ceiling of 50% to the final salary, it comprises an absolute.  It is very clear and straightforward as to how one would proceed.As I said at the outset, when considering legislation, one must always regard it as the last ever Bill.  We all know this is not true because legislation must be reviewed and updated constantly but that is how one must approach it.  Calculating 50% of one's final salary represents the most reasonable and concrete approach.  The Minister believes this absolutely.If one considers the reductions to the pay scales of those who are earning more than the average and applies the 50% ceiling, one is coming close, albeit not close enough, to what is desired.

In page 25, to delete lines 13 to 44 and substitute the following:"(2) In this section "referable amounts in respect of each calendar year or part of a calendar year", in relation to a calendar year or part of a calendar year of service, means—(a) in the case of a pension, an amount calculated at a rate of—(i) 0.58 per cent of the Scheme member's pensionable remuneration for that year or part of a year of service that is less than or equal to 3.74 times the value of the contributory State Pension at that time and, in respect of such service, as adjusted when not working on a full-time basis by reference to the proportion that the number of hours worked bears to the number of hours that would have been worked if working on a full-time basis, and(ii) 1.25 per cent of the Scheme member's pensionable remuneration for that year or part of a year of service that is greater than 3.74 times the value of the contributory State Pension at that time and, in respect of such service, as adjusted when not working on a full-time basis by reference to the proportion that the number of hours worked bears to the number of hours that would have been worked if working on a full-time basis,and(b) in the case of a lump sum payment, an amount calculated at a rate of 3.75 per cent of the Scheme member’s pensionable remuneration for that year or part of a year of service as adjusted, when not working on a full-time basis, by reference to the proportion that the number of hours worked bears to the number of hours that would have been worked if working on a full-time basis, and as adjusted thereafter, until payment of the pension and lump sum arises in accordance with this Part, by reference to such adjustments as may arise as provided for in section 40.”.These amendments, despite looking extraordinarily complicated, are technical and minor.  The first is to the section that calculates the benefit for the majority of public servants.  It simply involves the realignment of a subsection and, therefore, the drafter advised it necessitated the removal and reinstatement of the entire subsection.  The amendment is to make the "as adjusted thereafter" clause cover both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b).  The Bill, as cleared by the committee, only covered paragraph (b).  It should include “pension and lump sum” whereas it included only “pension”.  The amendment seems more complicated than it is but the adjustment is very minor and technical.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 25, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:"(3) Where a formula is being used for the calculation of retirement benefits, the Minister shall publish the basis for such formula, prior to the enactment of this Act.".In the course of calculating what a pension would be based on, the matter proceeded to the Labour Court, which made an adjudication and set a compromise figure of €45,000.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to explain the position.Yesterday, 10 July, the Minister issued a letter to the committee on the Bill and we all received a copy.  It dealt with certain aspects of the legislation, including the provision under discussion.  I do not fully understand it.I included my amendment on Committee Stage because I did not know whether we would receive clarification.  The Minister has made some effort to provide the basis for the calculation in the letter but some further explanation is required today.  A technical note was requested to explain the figures used in the single pension scheme for pension accrual for ordinary members.  I refer to appendix 2.  I find it hard to reconcile what the Minister says will be the pension entitlement for staff after the introduction of the new scheme with the potential savings listed.  We are beginning to get to the bottom of this.  The detail has not been given to us heretofore, despite the fact that this legislation has been before us for six months.We asked for a technical note on how the figures pertaining to the new scheme are being calculated.  The Minister's letter claims that, based on the estimates carried out by his Department, which, it must be stressed, are highly sensitive to changes that might happen in the middle of the century given that it will be 43 years before new entrants receive their full pensions, the annual expenditure on the pension scheme will be approximately €5 billion in today's terms.  The Minister states the new scheme will reduce the annual expenditure by approximately 35%, or €1.8 billion.  Importantly, he states the estimated saving will arise from indexation, in respect of which the figure will be €1 billion.  The figure for career average change is €500 million and that for the later pension age is €300 million because people will have to work for three years more than they would have worked under the old scheme.  We must take our time with this issue, as it sums up the Bill in one sentence.The Minister of State will understand the confusion.  Appendix 1 provides examples of the single scheme lump sum as a percentage of the lump sum under the current scheme.  The public's confusion arises in this regard.  I did not get my head around appendix 1 until I read the sentence I mentioned.  We have been debating this issue for six months, but we are only now at the crunch.  Perhaps the point was clarified, but 99.9% of the public does not know.  Maybe the people behind the Bill know what this is about.According to appendix 1, a clerical officer's pension will stay at 100% under the new scheme versus the current scheme.  As the officer is on low pay, he or she will not lose.  How was this figure calculated?  Different assumptions are made for years of service.  Under the new scheme, an executive officer's pension will be 85% of its current level, a higher executive officer's pension will be 78% and an assistant principal's pension will be 73%.  This lessening is the essence of the Bill.  According to the example used, a teacher's pension will be 83% of its current level, a senior staff nurse's pension will be 87% and a prison officer's pension will be 81%.  Under the new scheme, most people will have pensions of approximately 80% of the current levels.  Hence, the saving will be approximately 20-25%.  However, the Minister stated-----

Some 300,000 public servants are beginning to realise the importance of this debate.  One section of the Bill affects them, but we will discuss it later.  In general, the Bill only affects new entrants.  By and large, new entrants who retire after 43 years, having paid for three years longer, will have pensions in the order of 80% of what they would have been under the current scheme.  The Minister claims that there will be a saving of approximately 20%.  This is what we all understood the figure to be, although we might not have liked it.  However, the Minister also stated that the new scheme would reduce annual expenditure by approximately 35%.  Any person who heard him would have expected the new pension rates listed in the appendix to be approximately 65% of the current arrangements.  The figures have been dolled up to give them the appearance of being approximately 80%, but the small print on the previous page mentions savings of 35%.  These two figures do not tally.  How can we tell new recruits that, although their pensions will be 20% less, we will save 35%?  The Bills Digest could not get its head around this issue either when it produced its updated documentation on the Bill on 27 October 2011.  We raised this matter on Second Stage last autumn.  Some of the public sector unions could not reconcile the Minister's claim about the reduction in pensions being small with the purported savings of 35%.  We must tease out the question of why the figures do not tally.The career average change is a fundamental element of the new pension scheme, as pensions will be based on career average salaries.  For example, the No. 3 example of a higher executive officer on 78% of the current pension is based on ten years as a clerical officer, 15 years as an executive officer and 18 years as a higher executive officer.  Every public sector union asked us how the Minister could claim that he would cut the pension bill by 35% when he continued producing charts to show reductions of 20%.  Getting my head around this has been problematic.  For this reason, we asked for the formula, but I have not received what I sought.  We will discuss that issue on another day.Everyone understands that the career average change will form a significant aspect of the reduced pensions of new recruits.  Instead of one's pension being based on one's salary in the final few years at work, it will be based on one's career average earnings and lead to a saving of €500 million.  A further change is that a person must work in the public service for 43 years.  It is stated somewhere in the Bill that, due a career's extra three years, a person will be three years older when he or she retires.  According to the notes on the Schedule, a longer working career means more tax revenue and pension contributions to support the scheme's pay-as-you-go nature.  The later pension age means that the pension will be in payment for fewer years, notwithstanding increased longevity, and the national retirement age will have increased to 68 years.  That saving will amount to €300 million and the career average change will save €500 million.However, the major saving has not been dealt with yet, that is, the €1 billion relative to indexation.  Some 60% of the overall saving owes to the fact that, when a person retires, his or her pension will increase based on inflation.  Under the existing scheme, increases are based on current pay rates.  If a person works for a lifetime and retires under the new scheme, his or her pension increases will be capped to the consumer price index, CPI, rather than to pay increases.  As such, the scheme's main saving does not owe to the changes in terms of the career average earnings or becoming pensionable three years later.  Instead, it owes to the fact that, when people retire, inflation will screw them.  We will make our savings when they are in their old age, not when they are still making contributions.For decades, the standard of living in every Western society has increased.  If it had not, people would have the same standard of living now that they had in the 1930s.  My main gripe with the legislation is that, having given 43 years' service, contributed to the State and paid tax and PRSI, the increase in one's pension will be limited to the rate of inflation.  One will never receive a standard of living increase.  One could leave the service at 68 years of age and live for 30 years on a pension.  If society's wealth and standard of living increase and if the public sector payroll increases accordingly, pensioners will receive nothing.  We will not allow their pensions to decrease below the rate of inflation, but we will cap them at that rate as well.  If everyone else's quality of life and pay increase in the following 30 years, pensioners will still see no increases.  We are locking people into their final standard of living on the date they retire, and this despite the fact that they will not be on large pensions.  They will have contributed towards the overall annual pension fund by paying superannuation, various levies and taxes.  We are saying thanks for the 43 years of work and although they are leaving the service, if standards of living increase in the next ten or 20 years, they will get no increases relative to it.  They will be pegged to the consumer price index.This is the biggest single change in the legislation.  Everybody has been focused on the career average earnings aspect and the number of extra years that must be worked.  We are indicating that once a person is out the door, he or she should not expect an improved standard of living up to the day of death.  That is what the legislation is about.Some 60% of the total saving is due to indexation.  Pension increases after a person's retirement will be based on consumer price index increases and remain unconnected to increases in pay and earnings in society at large.  The figures from the past 20 years were provided by the Department in recent days, and on average public sector pay rates increased by 1% more than the rate of inflation in that time.  Over a period of 20 years, a person would have had a 20% improvement in the standard of living, which is only right.I would not like to think that the standard of living we have in Ireland today will be the same in 30 years or that nobody could expect an increased standard of living.  We are saying to these pensioners that the standard of living of everybody else can increase but when these people live off their pensions, they will never get an increase in their standard of living, although the income will be proofed against inflation.  If everybody else is seeing standards of living increasing by 1% per year - sometimes it may be half or a quarter of that - these pensioners will not share in it.  It is the meanest aspect of the legislation and where the savings come about.I could never reconcile the charts we were handed that showed how people's pensions would be at 81%, 87% or 83% of the current arrangement.  That may be true on the day the person retires but the Department will claw back the money.  At the end of a person's life, having lived on the pension for 20 years, what percentage of current arrangements will it be?  The figures I outlined are the high point on which a person starts but it will drop every year in a person's retirement.  When salaries and standards of living go up, the person on these pensions will only see them rise in line with inflation.  The pension as a percentage of current arrangements will decline year by year when a person is in retirement, and that is not reflected in today's information.  The best figure is given at year 1, and as a result a fair picture is not given.What has been described is accurate but the picture is incomplete.  A pensioner cannot expect an increase in standards of living if the State wants to claw back most of the money by linking increases to indexation.

Some €500 million will be saved from the change to career average earnings and there will be €300 million in savings from people having to work three years longer.  The biggest change is that once people go out on a pension, they should not expect any increase in their standard of living.  Some €1 billion will be saved on the back of pensions from this, and that is not fair to the people who will work for 43 years.

Until now, pension entitlements were dependent on increases in public sector pay and the automatic link has been broken, meaning we are into a much more vague metric involving the consumer price index, with all the potential ups and downs in that.  I heard Deputy Fleming state that public sector pay was ahead of the consumer price index but I do not accept that.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	281	It is over ten or 20 years.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The figures mask how people at the top can benefit from percentage increases to a much greater level than people at the bottom.  Percentage figures do not tell the complete story about how these issues affect everybody.  It is also wrong to say that pay is ahead of inflation, as people seek pay increases in order to deal with rises in the cost of the standards of living.  The consumer price index does not always reflect this fully, particularly how the rise in the cost of living affects people at different levels in society.  It is a much more vague process that is subject to factors other than the automatic link that currently exists between pension entitlements and pay in the public sector.In other sections it is made clear that all of this, in any event, is in the gift of the Minister.  What is the connection between the consumer price index and increases in pension entitlements?  There is no automatic link and it is up to the Minister to decide if and when any increases in pension entitlements are given.  That is a serious deterioration in pension entitlements for future pensioners from the public service when compared to the current guaranteed system.I disagree with some of the details in the way Deputy Fleming made his contribution but the substantial point is correct.  The bottom line is that the Government will make a massive saving on the back of future public sector pensioners who will see a very serious degradation in pension entitlements.  As has been stated by me and Deputy McDonald, among others, we would have no problem if this was the case for the very highly paid public servants who walk off with very handsome public sector pensions.  These are politicians, Secretaries General, etc.  The bulk of these savings will be made on the back of degrading pensions of people who are, for the most part, low and middle income earners and whose consequent pension entitlements are not that generous.  It is another austerity attack to make life worse for future pensioners.It is a severe indictment of our society that not only will the young people in future be worse off than their parents but the pensioners of the future will be worse off than the pensioners from the last generation.  It is a rotten indictment of what is happening in our economy and society and the way in which we are heading.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I thank Deputy Fleming for putting down the amendment.  He is correct as the gap between the 20% level and the 38% level relates to indexation and the later pension age.  It is no great secret.  The table is based on assumptions.As we are all very much aware, when we deal with pensions we can only work on assumptions because they are in the future.  We must make assumptions of a certain nature; they do not always turn out to be correct but we have to make them.I do not accept, and neither does the Minister, Deputy Fleming's assertion that the link between future pensions and the CPI will have a detrimental effect on pensions 30 or 40 years hence, because the contribution people will make during their career will also be indexed linked to the CPI.  Therefore, it is not so much a negative measure but will inflation-proof contributions and the eventual pension received as one exits from one's career.  This is the essential point.  I know the Deputy did not mean to gloss over this, but as contributions are made year by year they will be linked to the CPI so the contribution and the final ongoing payment will be inflation-proofed and this is how it will be.  I am sure this will not be the last piece of legislation on the issue.  Given the state of the country and as we look to the future it is a sensible arrangement.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I wish to speak specifically on one point I did not make.  We understand the formula referred to in the appendix states at present pension rates are based on the residual part of final pay after subtracting twice the rate of the contributory State pension.   This ensures a minimum floor for low-paid public sector workers.  A person who never worked in the public sector and who has a spouse would have twice the contributory State pension, and we want to avoid people working and coming out with little more than the pension they would have otherwise had.  According to the arrangement they will get 20% of their final salary regardless up to a certain figure, and we will not get into the nitty-gritty of this.

Up to now under this formula there was not an exact link, but generally the rate of increase of the old age pension matched increases in standards of living in society which were generally not too far removed from increases in public sector pay.  I do not know whether anyone has figures on this, but generally we have tried to look after people on the State pension as other pensioners and they would have benefited.  The point I am making is a small technical one.  Under this arrangement over a 20 year period if the contributory State pension increases more than inflation - which we would all hope it would and people have a real increase in their pension - but the pension of people under this scheme will be based on their contributions, we could find that ten years into payment the actual pension would reduce because it is linked to twice the amount of the State pension.  It is very important that in the first year of their pension people will have a real pension with a certain amount of money, but if the State pension increases over the next ten or 20 years from then we want to ensure a commensurate increase under this arrangement, particularly for people who were on low pay so their pension is not reduced as a percentage.

To delete pages 33 and 34 and in page 35, to delete lines 1 to 20.Deputy Fleming has tabled an alternative amendment to this one.  The crux of the issue is the difficulty with the fast accrual calculation.  A lengthy exchange took place in respect of the fact that everybody under the new scheme will be less well-off in terms of their pension entitlement and it will be a matter of degree.  The difficulty that arises for particular categories of workers in the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, prison officers and fire service employees is that they do not have as long a working life as others for operational reasons.  Therefore, a fast accrual system applies to them.I am aware that in the drafting of the legislation there was contact with the union representatives of these workers and that complicated equations and algebraic formulae were passed over the table in the effort to get things right.  However, I am reliably informed by these workers that they will be disproportionately affected by the terms and provisions of the fast accrual system.  They were are at pains to say that they are not looking for special treatment.  They understand the legislation means a level of pain for all public sector workers and appreciate that, but they think they are being unfairly treated.I do not believe that in the course of the lengthy discussions between the Department and the unions a satisfactory arrangement was reached for these categories of workers, whose virtue it should be borne in mind is regularly extolled by politicians and Members of the Dáíl.  For that reason, my amendment proposes the deletion of the proposals for the fast accrual system because, as envisaged, it is not right.  Deputy Fleming's amendment calls for the Minister to publish a report on the implications of the new scheme for the Garda, the Defence Forces, prison officers and so on and I imagine he is concerned about the same issue as myself.  It must be emphasised that for these categories of workers, who take on very arduous tasks, it is not fair or right that they be in a less advantageous position in the new scheme, but that they will be disproportionately affected as against other public service workers.  This does not tally with the kind of rhetoric we hear so often congratulating them on their efforts on our behalf.  I support Deputy Fleming's effort to have this issue addressed also.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 deal with the issue of uniformed workers working on behalf of the State, specifically members of the Garda Síochána, the Permanent Defence Forces, prison officers and specified fire brigade employees.  These are people in uniform who deal with emergency and other security services.  Everybody knows they have a difficult task to do, which is getting more difficult as the years progress.It is important we listen carefully to what these workers have said.  Recently we have met with and had correspondence from the Prison Officers' Association and from the public administration and community division of SIPTU.  We have received further correspondence from them in the past few days and they are still not happy with the current situation with regard to this issue.  We raised this matter extensively on Committee Stage and I was quite surprised by how hostile the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was.  The essence of what he said was that these people have a bloody great pension and they are looking for a better one again.  I was surprised by his tone.

I am paraphrasing and saying that was the gist of what he said.  We have gone through large sections of this legislation and we spent eight hours on Committee Stage.  In that time I was surprised by the Minister's attitude in just a couple of instances.  This was one of them.  In general, he was fair and reasonable and we could agree to disagree on issues, but when it came to this issue, I was surprised by his attitude.  He shocked us.  I advise all of the people working in the organisations to which I have referred to read the debate and judge this for themselves.  I am not quoting him, but over the eight hours of debate I was surprised by his attitude in this regard.  His view was that these people have a very good pension scheme, they can retire after 30 years and they are doing very well, but now they are coming in and looking for some enhancement of the new scheme.The representatives of these organisations have always been clear in the understanding when the scheme was being explained to them, that they would be no worse off than any other similar grade in respect of the position with regard to final pensions.  They all know they will be a bit worse off.  One would want to be blind and deaf not to understand that.  However, they do not want to be any more worse off than others of a similar grade.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	307	One would want to be blind and deaf not to understand the reasons for that.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	308	We understand all that.  Perhaps the Minister is not happy with the level of public sector pensions, but we will come to that later.  If the Minister wants to cut current public service pensions, he must bring forward proposals, but will not get much support on that.  If it is the Department's view that previous arrangements have given the public sector grade of workers to whom we have been referring too big a pension, so be it.The representatives of the unions say that according to the pension experts they consulted, Trident Consultants, it is not the case that these workers will be no worse off.  They say the workers will be worse off and say this is very unfair, on account of the fast accruals group and the early retirement age for this sector for operational reasons.  None of us wants to see 68 year old gardaí on duty at 2 a.m. on a Sunday morning or soldiers, prison officers or fire brigade officers of that age trying to perform onerous duties.  There is a good reason for early retirement for these sectors, due to the nature of their work.  These people are not looking for any enhanced terms, but want to be assured they will not be disadvantaged under the new arrangement.  The formula for dealing with their arrangement is different because of their particular situation.To return to the chart referred to in the Minister's letter, the comparison is made with only one person.  The clerical officer who serves his full career as a clerical officer will have no reduction in pension under the new scheme.  His pension will be 100% because of his career average.  However, the uniformed prison officer, who retires after 33 years as a prison officer, will only receive a pension of 81%.  Therefore, it is clear the clerical officer comes out with a full pension, but a prison officer who spends his entire career, including the extra three years, as a prison officer, will come out with only 81%.  The Minister may say that the reduction for assistant principal officers is of the same order, but in the example given by the Minister, the assistant principal has only spent 18 years in that position.  The majority of his career was at a lower level so his career average would be less than had he been constantly at the higher grade for his full career.Therefore, the chart the Minister gave us yesterday further reinforces the point being made by the prison officers, the Garda, the soldiers, the fire brigade people and SIPTU.  We had a presentation at our Oireachtas committee some months ago on this area and it was very useful.  We also had representatives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Association in who made a similar case.  They gave an example of the case of a higher executive officer who will get a pension of somewhere between 85% and 91% of current pension when we move onto the new arrangements.  They say the multiplier for fast accrual grades under the proposed new single scheme will only bring the pension of a prison officer to 80%.  The Minister confirmed this would be 81% in the chart he presented last night.  However, the pension of a clerical officer who remains at the same grade throughout his career will not be affected at all.  He will retire on the same pension.A person who gets no promotion during his career and who retires on the same grade after 43 years should not be affected by the new scheme, because the career average salary is close to final salary.  The same comparison does not apply to people who get promotion, as illustrated by the examples for every other grade on the chart, executive officer, higher executive officer, assistant principal grades and others.  They are not directly comparable, so they make the point that the addition of the fast accruals makes their situation relatively worse compared to others even though they know everybody is, to some extent, worse off.  That is why I asked the Minister - maybe by way of avoiding the interminable debate we could have on this matter - to publish a report on the implications of this.  We got the message loud and clear on Committee Stage that the Minister was pressing ahead.  He rejected our views on that matter.  Unfortunately, I am taking it as a fait accompli  that the Bill will pass today without the amendment Deputy McDonald proposed which would delete the section dealing with this issue.  On the basis the Minister is determined to push this through, we want to see a report within six months on the actual implications and more worked out examples.We got something from the public sector employees, who are competent people, through their trade unions, and we must accept what they say at face value but we also want to test what they say.  There is only one line in that whole report dealing with people on the fast accruals basis.  If the legislation is passed - we suspect it will be - we would like to see a report in a few months time analysing this in further detail.  That should not be an undue burden on the Department and it is something to which we ask the Minister to agree.  He does not need to include it in the legislation but he can give a commitment to come back with a detailed report on this matter before the end of the year.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I would like to reinforce the point.  Everybody accepts that firefighters, prison officers and Army personnel do extremely difficult, arduous and sometimes very dangerous jobs and that it is entirely fair and reasonable that they retire earlier.  They should not be penalised more than others because of the nature of their jobs.  Judging from the tone of the Minister's response when this issue was raised on Committee Stage, he somehow seemed to think that because they have a shorter working life, they are getting an easier ride than everybody else and, consequently, it is somewhat more justified to put an excessive penalty on them in terms of the impact the new legislation will have on pension entitlements in the future.The unions were very clear when they appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service that these categories of public sector workers would be disproportionately hit in terms of their future pension entitlements after the passing of this Bill.  They have not heard a convincing response to the contrary from the Government on that matter.  The Minister should have taken this on board and engaged more with the unions.Maybe the Minister of State can tell us definitively if the case they are making is wrong.  This concerns their pensions so I would say they have a fair idea how they work and how this Bill is likely to impact on them.  Is the Minister of State telling us that this is not the case and that they will not be disproportionately hit because they are pretty certain they will be, which would be unfair?  It is bad enough that many low and middle income public sector workers will see the quality of their pensions degraded but it is even more unfair if particular categories of people, who do difficult and dangerous work, are excessively penalised by the measures contained in this Bill.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	310	It is agreed that what Deputy Fleming is looking for in his amendment, namely, a report after six months is not long enough in terms of this type of scheme.  One would have to give it a little more time.  It has been explained to me that it would be okay if a new entrant died shortly after entering the service.  One might be able to do an early micro assessment but I do not think that would be very reasonable in terms of how it would work into the future.  The report will have to wait a little bit longer.  It is a good idea but six months is a little bit unreasonable.I refer to Deputy Fleming's argument in regard to clerical officers, for instance.  Clerical officers will have to work longer and will not be allowed to retire until they are 60 years of age.  Prison officers will also work until they are 60 years of age but they may retire at 55 years of age, which is a clear distinction.  Clerical officers will work until they are 68 years of age under the new arrangements.The Minister's commitment to the public service is not something for which he has been widely praised but I do not believe anyone would doubt his commitment to it and to protecting that particular group of people.  That group of people includes not only those we see sitting at desks or meeting people at counters but people in uniforms who do very dangerous jobs.  The reason the Minister is not here today is that he has a meeting with the Taoiseach in regard to the Croke Park agreement.  His commitment cannot be doubted and it is probably stronger than any other person's in the State.The Department recently sent a fairly comprehensive letter to the Prison Officers Association, SIPTU, the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the Garda Representative Association, Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers confirming that the report drawn up in regard to the public sector clearly states that people in these categories will not be unduly affected by the changes to the scheme compared to current members.  The Minister is not inclined to accept the amendment.Deputy McDonald is opposing this section which provides the scheme members, who may be required to retire early, such as the gardaí, Permanent Defence Force members, firefighters and prison officers, with early paid pensions and fast accrual.  I cannot accept the amendment which would strip these uniformed public servants of these valuable and important benefits in the single scheme.Deputy Fleming wants a report to be published within six months of the enactment of this Act on the implications of the new scheme for the categories covered by this section.  As the Minister said on Committee Stage, there are, as there should be, review powers in section 41 of the Bill which will allow the scheme to be reviewed for any class of scheme members.The Department has not had a response to the letter sent to all of the main players, including the unions, on this issue.  If a fast accruals system is to be put in place, which is right because we rely on these people for our safety in all sorts of ways every day of the week, there will be an additional cost but it is a cost which will be reflected in the exit.  It is right that people in these areas are allowed to retire earlier because they do jobs which they cannot go on doing indefinitely.

Six members of the Defence Forces have been deployed as unarmed military observers to the mission since 11 May.UNSMIS's mandate is to monitor and report on the security situation and on any transgression of the ceasefire agreement, as well as on the implementation of the six-point peace plan of Mr. Kofi Annan, the UN and Arab League joint special envoy.  Following the intensification of armed violence, the head of mission, General Robert Mood, announced on 15 June that UNSMIS had suspended its normal activities.  The suspension is being reviewed on a daily basis by the UN.  While normal activities have not resumed, UN military observers, UNMOs, have undertaken limited patrols to humanitarian sites since 26 June.  In carrying out their mission, members of UNSMIS have been subjected to utterly unacceptable attacks and limitations on their activities.  Such attacks and restrictions must stop and the safety and security of UNSMIS personnel must be rigorously respected, with particular responsibility falling on Syria as host nation.The UN Security Council is expected to decide on the future configuration of the mission on 18 July, in advance of the expiry of the initial 90 day mandate on 20 July.  UN Secretary General Ban is presenting a report to the UN Security Council today which will form the basis for a review of the mission's current mandate.  While all options are on the table, from a scaled down mission to complete withdrawal, I continue to believe that the mandate of UNSMIS remains critical in objectively monitoring the situation on the ground while its presence is also of great importance and reassurance to the Syrian population.  I hope, therefore, that the Security Council will decide to extend the mission, even albeit in reduced form.

Since we last debated this difficult situation in the Chamber, we have had the opportunity, through the good offices of Deputy Pat Breen, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, to hear at first hand the experience of Syrian citizens resident in this country.  That meeting was held  in camera, lest their families in Syria be put at risk by the evidence being given.  That meeting brought home to us the enormous seriousness and the impact of this disastrous situation on families.  I salute the Tánaiste for the work he has been doing through Friends of Syria.  The last time we spoke about this matter in the Dáil we mentioned the statement of the United States Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, about attack helicopters being provided by the Russian regime.  Mrs. Clinton got it wrong, it would appear.  It was repair of helicopters that was being carried out by the Russian authorities.  Does the Tánaiste agree with the Secretary of State when she asserts that China and Russia have a critical role to play in working towards a resolution of this problem?  What is his response to the suggestion from Moscow that the Iranian authorities, and Prime Minister Ahmadinejad, should be involved in the process of working towards a resolution to the problem, given the close relations that exist between Iran and Syria?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	314	As Deputy Ó Fearghaíl acknowledged, I attended last Friday's meeting of Friends of Syria at which 107 countries were represented, about half at ministerial level.  We heard from representatives of the Syrian opposition of the atrocities being committed in Syria.  About 16,000 people have been killed in Syria and there is continuing violence and attacks on the civilian population.A robust position by the United Nations is needed.  There has been one Security Council resolution which I have described and that allowed for the establishment of UNSMIS.  However, it is our belief that we need a UN Security Council resolution that will allow for the imposition of much more robust and more widely respected sanctions against the Syrian regime.  For that, the agreement of Russia and China would be necessary.  Continuing efforts are being made to persuade both Russia and China to participate in a UN Security Council resolution.  I hope they will do so.  Their influence in involving other countries that may be useful in bringing about a resolution of the atrocities, including Iran, would be helpful.  At this stage, the focus is on seeing what can be done to obtain a further Security Council resolution that would have real impact on the ground.

All Members of the Dáil are committed to pursuing diplomatic means, but the assertion of those most directly affected was that military intervention is required.Has the Tánaiste had discussions with his EU counterparts regarding what will happen after 20 July?  We are in a civil war situation that is continuing and getting worse.  On Monday last, 100 people were killed in Syria and that was described as an average number of deaths.  Has the Tánaiste had any bilateral contact with his counterparts in Russia or China on this matter?

One concern is the possibility of the deterioration of the situation in Syria to full-scale sectarian civil war.  The situation on the ground is complex and the focus of the international community is on securing a resolution of the appalling situation in Syria without military intervention.The European Union Foreign Affairs Council will be meeting on 24 July and will review the situation that exists after 20 July.  We are in close contact with the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, and other member states about the situation in Syria and we maintain close contact with them.  I have discussed the situation with the Foreign Ministers of Russia and China but I have not had such a discussion in recent weeks.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The nuclear non-proliferation treaty makes no specific reference to a right to engage in uranium enrichment.  Article IV (1) of the treaty provides that states are entitled to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  This entitlement must be exercised in conformity with Article II, under which non-nuclear-weapon states, including Iran, undertake not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  Furthermore, each non-nuclear weapon state is obliged to accept IAEA safeguards with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful purposes to military purposes.Iran has repeatedly failed to live up to its international treaty obligations and is in breach of a succession of Security Council and IAEA resolutions, including those that call for a suspension of its enrichment activities.  A report issued by the IAEA last November concluded that there are grounds for serious concern about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme and indicated that Iran had carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.  In another report published in May, the agency indicated that it is unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran and therefore cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is used for peaceful activities.The international community has consistently urged the Iranian Government to respect and fulfil its international obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and seriously and unconditionally engage in discussions aimed at confirming the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.  Ireland strongly supports this position.

Ireland was a driving force in the non-proliferation treaty and was one of the first states invited to sign it.  It is unfortunate that we have supported sanctions against Iran which were advocated by the US, Britain and certain other European states.The report prepared by the IAEA did not provide any evidence that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.  Indeed, US intelligence services have been unable to provide evidence that such a programme exists.  It is clear that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.  Israel, however, is reputed to possess more than 400 nuclear warheads even while it increases its trade with the European Union.  It is also the biggest beneficiary of state aid from the United States, receiving $3 billion per annum.  Does the Tánaiste agree that double standards are being applied and that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear enrichment programme for peaceful purposes if it is fully supervised, as I am sure it will agree, by the IAEA?  It is unreasonable for any state to argue otherwise.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The IAEA set out at some length its concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme in its report of 8 November.  This report concluded that the available information indicates that Iran had carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.  Its most recent report, which was published in May, states that because Iran is not providing the necessary co-operation and is not implementing its additional protocol, the agency is unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran and therefore cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is used for peaceful activities.  The Irish Government and our EU partners are satisfied that the IAEA's reports are credible and their conclusions must be taken seriously.  The November report is based on information drawn from a wide variety of sources, including regular inspection visits by IAEA inspectors to Iran, and is deemed to be consistent in terms of technical content, individual and organisational involvement and timeframes.  The IAEA is the international watchdog on these matters and has unrivalled technical expertise and a record of absolute impartiality and independence.  Its report was the basis for the European Union's decision on sanctions, the objective of which was to bring Iran to the table to negotiate in a meaningful way in the E3+3 process.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Thankfully the talks appear to be moving towards a peaceful conclusion, although that may disappoint certain states in the region.  These states may have ambitions for Iran which would not be shared by Ireland.  Three experts, Professor Paul Pillar, who worked for the CIA for 28 years and could be accused of having a vested interest against the United States, Peter Jenkins, the UK ambassador to the IAEA between 2001 and 2006, and Hans Blix, the former head of the IAEA, have stated that the November report contains no evidence that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, the evidence from inspectors on the ground does not back up the claim, which was contained in an appendix full of old allegations which have never been backed up by evidence.We are bringing the region to the verge of catastrophic conflict because of somebody's agenda.  I again ask the Tánaiste why Ireland supports sanctions against Iran despite a lack of evidence that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons at the same time as offering favourable trade agreements to Israel, which possesses more than 400 nuclear warheads.  Why do we permit such double standards?  How can Ireland call itself neutral while it takes this approach?  We recently upgraded our trade relationship with Israel to allow its pharmaceutical businesses to avail of huge profits.  We are rewarding Israel for its belligerent approach while severely punishing Iran without evidence.  What good is the non-proliferation treaty when countries are rewarded for not signing up or making themselves accountable to the IAEA while others which seek to comply are punished?  How can peace be served by such an approach?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The approach that Ireland is taking, in co-operation with other EU member states, is intended to avoid bringing the region to the brink of conflict.  The objective of the sanctions was to persuade Iran to come to the negotiating table.  We believe the Iranian nuclear issue can only be resolved through negotiation and agreement within the E3+3 process.  As the Deputy has acknowledged, the negotiations have started.  The negotiations held in Istanbul on 14 April were more constructive than previous discussions and held out the hope of a change of course on the part of Iran.  Unfortunately, while Iran has engaged more seriously in two subsequent rounds of talks, it has concentrated on details and process while making no effort to work towards a solution.  The impression given by the Iranian delegation is that it is authorised only to restate its position and is unable to seek solutions.  A further round of talks is expected to follow technical meetings which will clarify details.  I hope Iran will be ready to take significant and concrete steps to promote international confidence in its intentions.As Iran is a party to the non-proliferation treaty it must live up to its obligations under the treaty.  Israel is not a party to the treaty but we continue to urge it and other states to adhere to the treaty's terms as non-nuclear weapon states.

Ireland's diplomatic relations with Bangladesh are maintained by secondary accreditation via our embassy in New Delhi.  I have requested that officials at the embassy make contact with relevant EU colleagues in Dhaka in regard to this case.On 2 July 2012 Ireland joined a statement on the safety of journalists which was delivered by Austria at the 21st session of the Human Rights Council.  This statement strongly condemned all human rights violations against journalists.  Human rights have been a priority for successive Irish Governments and form a central part of our foreign policy.  In particular, Ireland attaches considerable importance to the vital work of human rights defenders and condemns all acts or threats of violence against organisations and individuals working to protect human rights.  Ireland, together with our partners in the EU, is committed to promoting human rights and to eliminating torture and the mistreatment of prisoners.  The EU makes detailed representations regularly in response to executions, extra-judicial killings, arrests of human rights activists and restrictions on freedom of expression.Ireland will continue to support efforts to ensure that these rights are upheld and respected and that this case is investigated in keeping with the need to respect the rule of law.

I chair an international fact-finding commission, comprising people from America, Canada, Bangladesh and England, into the murder of both these journalists in front of their five-year old son last February in Bangladesh.  Their deaths are just one part of a continuous series of physical attacks and murders perpetrated against journalists in Bangladesh, which amounts to a serious blow against freedom of expression.  When journalists in Bangladesh protested following these deaths they were met by a murderous response both by the army and police there.  Even the high court in Bangladesh has said it is dissatisfied with the poor progress of the investigation.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Bangladesh is among the worst nations in the world in combating deadly anti-press violence.  The highly respected New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, has tracked the murders of 12 journalists in Bangladesh that have not even been investigated.An independent and credible investigation into the torture, murder and disappearance not only of journalists but a growing number of opposition leaders, labour activists and student leaders is badly needed.  I ask the Tánaiste to call for the arrest of the killers of these journalists who apparently are well known in Bangladesh.  This matter should be reinvestigated because the original investigation into the murder of these particular journalists has stopped.  The Tánaiste should also call for an end to the assault and harassment of journalists in Bangladesh while performing their professional duties.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The case raised by Deputy Halligan is indeed serious.  The safety and protection of journalists are matters to which we attach a very high importance.  Journalists should be able to go about their work without being at risk.  The responsibility for investigating the crime lies with the authorities in Bangladesh and they must be allowed to carry out that investigation.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, is encouraging the Bangladeshi authorities to ensure that there is a full and fair investigation into this and similar cases.I am aware that there have been a number of incidents involving journalists over the past number of months.  There have been reports to that effect from the Bangladeshi NGO, Odhikar.  Some of the cases have involved attacks and-or intimidation.  There are other unresolved incidents, including the unsolved murders of a Saudi diplomat and a labour rights activist, and the disappearance and abduction of a former MP.  These cases, along with those referred to by Deputy Halligan, are being monitored by EU representatives in Dhaka.  Along with its EU partners, Ireland would encourage the Bangladeshi authorities to ensure that there is a full and fair investigation of these incidents.

I thank him for having made contact with the Bangladeshi authorities but I would urge him to continue those contacts in the coming months.  When other countries made contact with the Bangladeshi Prime Minister during the week, he made a curt remark, stating, "We can't guard every journalist's bedroom".  That is the extent of the investigation that is currently taking place into the murder of these two young journalists.  I urge the Tánaiste to continue to protest against the Bangladeshi Government's harassment of journalists and like-minded people there.  The brutal murder of those two journalists in front of their five-year old child should be reinvestigated.

As the person referred to is not an Irish citizen, it is not possible for my Department to offer him consular assistance.  The Greek authorities are under no legal obligation to assist our embassy with any requests made in connection with this investigation as we have no locus standi in the matter.However, on hearing of the predicament faced by this person, and notwithstanding the fact that he is not a citizen of Ireland, the Irish embassy in Athens made contact with the Greek police in an effort to convey the Irish Government's interest in this case on the basis that he is married to an Irish citizen.  It was made clear to our embassy that the authorities in Crete would not provide them with any information regarding this investigation owing to the fact that no Irish citizen was involved in the case.To clarify further, the embassy has certain rights of communication and contact with Irish citizens in Greece to facilitate the exercise of our consular functions under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  The embassy has no such rights for other persons, even if they are related to Irish citizens.

In earlier written questions on this matter the possibility of any engagement on behalf of the family seemed to have been ruled out.  I have a serious concern about this case.  The young man in question is an Albanian citizen who is married to a young teacher from County Carlow.  In the past, we have been able to highlight the obvious injustices to Irish-trained doctors in Bahrain, so we should also be able to reflect concern about this particular case.Mark and Andreas Marku are two young Albanian brothers who have been wrongly condemned by failures in the Cretan justice system to 18 years' imprisonment.  Their nightmare began in September 2010 and they have spent the past 18 months incarcerated in Neapoli Prison in Crete.  In January this year, they were convicted of ten armed robberies, the theft of 12 cars and of being members of an armed criminal gang.  My information is that Mark Marku was in Ireland in the company of his wife when a number of these crimes were supposed to have transpired.

Given that he is married to an Irish citizen, however, we did attempt to make contact with the Greek police to see if we could be of some assistance and make inquiries about the matter.  As Deputy Ó Fearghaíl has said, the man concerned, who is an Albanian citizen, was arrested in Crete on 16 September 2010.  He was one of several others who were charged with being members of an armed criminal organisation, ten armed robberies, the theft of 12 cars, armed assault, possession of illegal arms and possession of drugs.In January 2012, he was charged with and subsequently convicted of these offences and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, met with Mr. Marku's parents-in-law on 3 July regarding the case, at which time she advised them that as Mr. Marku is not an Irish citizen there is no consular role for the Irish Government in the case.  I understand an issue has arisen in regard to documents which would show that Mr. Marku was in Ireland.  Again, the conduct of a criminal case is a matter for the presiding judge.  It would be a matter for Mr. Marku's defence lawyers to ensure that the relevant documents are provided.My Department can authenticate documents executed in Ireland that are to be used in court cases in other countries.  However, authentication of a document simply confirms that a particular signature, seal or stamp appearing on a document is genuine.  Unfortunately, this is not a case in respect of which we can make direct consular representation as Mr. Marku is not an Irish citizen.

Can he, for example, call on the Greek authorities to ensure that the appeal in this case is expedited and could he make arrangements to have our embassy represented at the appeal hearing so that we can at least hear first hand what is going on?  The lawyer representing Mr. Marku stated in recent correspondence that he would characterise the trial as a trial of purpose and that Mark's guilt had been decided by the court, with no consideration of his allegations or the facts.Official documents produced by the defence which sought to prove Mr. Marku had been married in this country and was resident here at the time, were described by the prosecution as forgeries.  I would expect that the Department of Foreign Affairs could at least defend the authenticity of legal documents produced in this country and offered in evidence elsewhere.

It would not be appropriate or helpful if I were to make any comment on the trial, verdict or appeal process.  That would also not be helpful to the man concerned.  I do not propose to do so.If Mr. Marku's defence lawyers wish to authentic documents here, this can be done through the consular section in my Department.  We are happy to do so.  As I stated, we have taken an interest in this case.  Our embassy in Athens has attempted to have the issue raised with the authorities in Greece.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has met with the Irish in-laws of the man concerned.  We are open to maintaining that contact but we cannot intervene inappropriately in what is a judicial matter in another member state of the European Union.

On 16 December 1965, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2065 (XX), which invited the Governments of the United Kingdom and Argentina to proceed without delay with the negotiations recommended by the then special committee on the situation with regard to the implementation of the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, requesting them to report back on results of the negotiations.The General Assembly again addressed the issue at its plenary session on 14 December 1973 and adopted resolution 3160 (XXVIII).  This resolution noted the passage of time since the previous resolution and the fact that no substantial progress had been made in negotiations.  The resolution again urged the Governments of the United Kingdom and Argentina to proceed without delay with the negotiations in accordance with the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.The question was the subject of another resolution in 1976 and of annual resolutions between 1982 and 1988.   The most recent resolution, 43/25, was adopted in 1988 in which the General Assembly reiterated its request to the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to initiate negotiations with a view to finding the means to resolve peacefully and definitively the problems between both countries, including all aspects of the future of the Falkland Islands, Malvinas, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.The issue has also been discussed at the UN's special committee on decolonisation every year since 1964.  In its most recent resolution, adopted on 14 June 2012, the committee expressed its regret that, despite widespread international support for negotiation between the two Governments, implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the question had not yet started.Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.The Governments were requested to consolidate the current process of dialogue and co-operation through resumed negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the dispute relating to the question of the Falkland Islands, Malvinas, in line with General Assembly resolutions.  I would encourage the United Kingdom and Argentina, two countries with which Ireland has excellent bilateral relations, to pursue a peaceful resolution of their differences on this matter, based on the relevant UN resolutions.

As he stated there have been ten resolutions calling on the UK and Argentinian Governments to proceed to negotiations without delay.  However, the Minister of State ignored the fact that the UK is not co-operating with the United Nations resolutions.Will the Minister of State accept that in recent months there has been a major militarisation of the south Atlantic in the region of the Malvinas Islands?  Will he further accept that this is totally unacceptable and is very provocative to the Argentinian people?  Will the Minister of State also accept, as would any international observer or person from Ireland, which is a neutral country, that historically the Malvinas Islands have belonged to the Argentinian people?Will the Minister of State accept the right of Argentina, as a sovereign nation and country, which is now a democracy, to claim the Malvinas Islands through peaceful and democratic means?  Will he support the formal complaints and resolutions at the United Nations in relation to this militarisation of the south Atlantic around the Malvinas Islands and will he put pressure on the UK Government to come to the table and talk with the representations of the Argentinian people on this issue?

As stated by the Deputy, there have been multiple EU resolutions on this issue, including a special committee resolution as recently as last month.  However, there has been little progress made.  Ireland has supported the United Nations and the international community on this matter.  We have supported the European Union, the position of which is that both countries should engage in negotiations.  It is impossible for us to compel both countries to do so.  I agree with the Deputy that the situation has not improved in recent times despite that these resolutions have been repeated on numerous occasions by the European Union.  Ireland strongly supports the resolutions put forward by the European Union.  We will continue to support the United Nations position on this issue.

However, staying silent at international level over fear of upsetting our neighbour, Britain, is not an option.  Until 1997 Hong Kong was a British colony and many people are suggesting such a model as a solution for the Malvinas issue.  I want the Labour Party through the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to assert Ireland's independent foreign democratic peaceful policy that is at the core of the Labour Party and not to be excessively influenced by those in Europe connected with NATO and those in the Government connected with Fine Gael.

We regard the United Nations as the international forum for dealing with these matters and the negotiations should take place in accordance with the many United Nations resolutions on the issue.  We will continue to support that position and we will argue it at the United Nations at all times.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	342	It is important to be clear that I have not made any proposal for a boycott of Israeli goods, and the Government does not support any such boycott.  Successive Irish Governments have taken this view, and recognised also that such a proposal would have no chance of success.The Foreign Affairs Council in May adopted conclusions on a range of critical and urgent issues which, in our view, increasingly threaten to make a peace agreement in the Middle East impossible to achieve.  These issues centre on Israeli policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory which are progressively forcing Palestinians off the land in favour of illegal Israeli settlements.  I made a detailed intervention in the Council debate.  In addition, my officials had been heavily involved beforehand in the preparation of the draft conclusions.  The conclusions adopted by the Council restated and in many respects advanced EU positions on these key issues and set out the remedial action which we wish to see, primarily of course from Israel.I suggested at the Council that, in view of the urgency of these issues on the ground, Ministers should reconsider them in the autumn to see if the situation had improved or was continuing to worsen.  I suggested that, if matters continued to worsen and our existing actions had not improved them, we would clearly need to consider stronger actions.  The exclusion from the EU of settlement products and of individual settlers engaged in violence should in that case be considered as an option for stronger measures.  I have previously stated that Ireland would support a ban on settlement products.  I repeat that we do not support bans or boycotts on Israel and this is not in question.  However, the products of illegal settlements, located in Occupied Palestinian Territory, constitute a separate and specific matter.However, that is to look ahead and the Council as a whole will have to decide on any actions.  At this point I emphasise that we have achieved a strong EU position which leaves High Representative Ashton and the EU well placed to press our concerns on these issues.

We all agree that the settlement is the biggest impediment to progress.  Does the Tánaiste have any optimism that that issue will be addressed in the near future?  Every new settlement makes the two-state solution - which we all support - more difficult to achieve.  Is he optimistic given the realigned coalition arrangement between Likud and Kadima that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, might move in the right direction?  The Tánaiste referred to a possible boycott of goods from the Occupied Territories.  Denmark and South Africa have embarked on a process of demanding that these be labelled as products of the Occupied West Bank.  What is his view on that initiative by those two sovereign powers?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I have previously outlined my belief that settlements are now at the heart of the continuing conflict and represent a key obstacle in then way of peace.  It is very important that the EU has now clearly highlighted the continuing expansion of settlements as posing a real threat to the viability of a negotiated peace and the two-state solution.  Every expansion of settlements makes peace more difficult for three reasons.  First, the settlements are physically making the construction of a viable Palestinian state more difficult.  Second, settlements and the measures taken to protect them inherently involve dispossession and theft of Palestinian land and resources, and daily obstacles and humiliations for Palestinians, increasing the likelihood of an explosive reaction.  Third, this ongoing pressure on Palestinians makes it difficult or impossible for their leaders to sit down and talk with Israel while this continues outside the room.Considerable progress has been made in that we have now secured a very strong European Union statement unanimously agreed by all 27 member states on the issue.  I have asked that we return to it in the autumn to determine if any progress has been made.  If progress is not made the European Union will need to consider stronger action, including perhaps a ban on products from the settlement areas.

How does the Tánaiste feel about that?  How does he respond to the very fair points made earlier by Deputy Mac Lochlainn who earlier contrasted the response of the EU and the international community to the situation in Iran and the embargoes placed on it with the reluctance to take any strong action in this instance?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I recently read that a Swedish official suggested that Ireland's stance on Palestine was not quite as strong as it has been in the past.  I wonder if the presence of a very pro-Israeli individual in the Cabinet, in the person of the Minister for Justice and Equality, is in any way watering down our position in supporting Palestine.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I wish to correct a comment made earlier.  Not all of us are in favour of a two-state solution.  Some of us believe the two-state solution is a recipe for ethnic cleansing of precisely the sort we have seen and continue to see by the rogue Israeli State.  At what point does the international community realise that Israel is a rogue state, that it is involved in ethnic cleansing, that it has no interest in a reasonable settlement with the Palestinians and that it must not just have the products of the Occupied Territories boycotted but should be treated in the same way as apartheid South Africa was and isolated by the international community as a whole?  It is not possible to separate what the Israeli military forces are doing in the Occupied Territories from the state itself because the decisions to allow further settlements, military incursions or whatever it may be are being taken in Israel proper.  They are being taken in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the headquarters of the Israeli defence forces.  At what point does the world say we will not allow Israel to do this anymore and boycott it until it treats Palestinians as equal citizens?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The conflict between Israel and Palestine has been going on for a very long time.  There have been repeated efforts over the years to get a resolution.  It does not help to reduce it to the kind of simplistic terms that Deputy Boyd Barrett has used.  Ireland's position on the issue is very strong as is acknowledged internationally.  Speaking at the United Nations last year, I made clear Ireland's position in respect of Palestinian statehood.  We have been actively seeking a strong position from the European Union on the issue, which was not easy to achieve.  There are widely differing views among member states of the European Union in respect of the Middle East peace process.  At the recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting we secured what I think is the strongest position that the European Union has adopted to date in respect of the issue of Palestine.  That provides us with a basis to build on.  The position in clear in respect of settlements and the impact they will have on achieving a peaceful resolution of the issue and of achieving a viable Palestinian state, and I will continue to pursue that.  I have asked that it be brought back for consideration at the Foreign Affairs Council in the autumn.  I expect there will be an opportunity to have the issue discussed around the UN General Assembly in September.  We have a very strong position in regard to Palestine in terms of securing a settlement but that can only achieved if it is not impeded or obstructed by illegal settlements being put in place on the ground.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Given the major concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme as documented in a series of UN Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions since 2006, and given Iran's continuing unwillingness to engage seriously on these concerns or to address the serious findings highlighted in the IAEA's reports, the international community has had to impose several rounds of increasingly tough restrictive measures.These include an EU embargo on Iranian petrochemical products and a ban on crude oil imports to the EU which took effect on 1 July.  The June Foreign Affairs Council agreed that Iran's engagement in talks up to that point had given no basis for postponing the measure.  I have no doubt that these measures, by the EU and others, were instrumental in triggering Iran's belated acceptance of talks in recent months.There have been three rounds of talks between Iran and the E3+3, in Istanbul in April, Baghdad in May and, most recently, in Moscow on 18 June, as well as some follow-up technical discussions.  A further round is expected but not yet scheduled.While Iran has engaged in these talks in a somewhat more realistic manner than before, hopes raised by the April meeting have regrettably not been borne out yet.  Iran's negotiators have engaged with the issues, which is an improvement, but in a manner which so far suggests that they are seeking only to spin out the process, and not to actively work to reach a solution.  There is no agreement among the E3+3 that a further round of talks is warranted, but Iran will have to demonstrate more serious engagement if the talks process is to go anywhere.Ultimately, the grave issues arising in terms of Iran's nuclear programme can only be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and not by any other means.  Ireland, with its EU partners, will continue to lend strong support to High Representative Ashton and the other members of the E3+3 as they pursue the twin-track approach which is aimed at persuading Iran to negotiate seriously - and which now appears to be paying some dividends.

The two critical elements in the negotiations at present are that Iran would stop enriching Uranium to the 20% level and that the 1,200 kg already enriched would be exported out of the state and in return for that the world powers would make concessions to help Iran develop its civil nuclear programme, they would help bolster safety at the existing nuclear facilities and they would help Iran obtain spare parts for its civil aircraft.  That appears to be the critical issue on offer.  Is the Tánaiste of the view that progress in that regard would justify the removal of sanctions?I am conscious that the Minister wearing his trade hat - or the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, seating beside him, wearing his - has responsibility in the area of the €80 million-plus value of trade relations we have with this country.  Notwithstanding the valid points made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, does the Minister see Ireland as being a trading partner of Iran?  Having had some traditional relations with it, I am conscious of the diplomatic efforts in this country of Ambassador Panahiazar, who is constantly asserting the fact that his country is not, nor has any desire to be, involved in the creation of weapons of mass destruction.  Does the Minister consider there is any potential for Ireland to play any significant additional role to what is currently happening within the EU?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	351	It is important to make the point that when sanctions were agreed, particularly when the crude oil sanction was agreed, its application was not applied immediately.  It was decided to apply it from 1 July and the purpose of that was to encourage Iran to engage seriously in E3+3 talks.  If there is serious engagement at the E3+3 talks and satisfactory progress is being made on them, then the sanctions can either be eased or withdrawn.  The only purpose of the sanctions is to cause Iran to engage seriously in those negotiations.  We believe that the Iran nuclear issue can only be resolved by negotiation and agreement but it requires Iran engaging in a meaningful way, not just turning up and engaging in process talk and spinning it out.  There must be a real meaningful engagement.  There is a willingness on the EU's part to engage seriously and meaningfully in those talks.  If sufficient and satisfactory progress is made, then sanctions can either be relaxed or withdrawn.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I want to make it clear that I have no time for the Iranian regime, nuclear weapons or nuclear power.  Can the Minister explain the extraordinary double standards that apply when it comes to the treatment of Iran as against the treatment of Israel?  Israel is ethnically cleansing Palestinians, illegally occupying their land and territory, denying them rights at every level, has launched more wars than any other state in the Middle East, has a nuclear arms arsenal, has refused to sign up the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and flouts all international laws in this regard but no sanctions are imposed on it.  However, Iran has signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency has said it is not developing a nuclear arms programme, and sanctions have been imposed on it.  I do not understand it.  Iran has never launched a war against anybody.  The supreme leader of Iran, no matter what the we may think of him, has said that nuclear weapons are an evil and that they should never be developed in Iran.  Why is it the case that all these sanctions and pressure are put on Iran and no sanctions or pressure are put on Israel which has 200 or 300 nuclear weapons and refuses to sign up to the nuclear anti-proliferation treaty?

Blatantly shocking double standards continue to apply in this regard to Israel.  The decision to close our embassy in Tehran was a bad one.  Have we considered inserting ourselves into this situation?  Have we considered Ireland's role as one of the driving forces behind the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a neutral country, although that has been undermined by the use of Shannon for military stop-offs?  Have we considered playing a constructive role in the Middle East and in conflicts such as this because my understanding from engagements with the Iranian ambassador is that Iran would see Ireland as a neutral country and an honest broker?  I presume the United States would view us similarly, considering our umbilical relationship with it.  Is this something we have considered?  What is the Minister's vision for foreign affairs?  Where does he see Ireland's role in terms of those conflicts in that region?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Ireland has a very long and proud track record of promoting non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and that position remains absolute and consistent.  This is position is not applied differently to Iran or to anywhere else.  We want to see a nuclear-free zone with countries completely free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East.  This means no nuclear weapons in Israel, no nuclear weapons in Iran and no nuclear weapons anywhere else.  We all understand the horror that can be inflicted on the region and on the world by the outbreak of a nuclear war.  The reason for sanctions on Iran is simple; the IAEA has made a report which has been considered by the European Union.  Iran is a party to the non-proliferation treaty.  A country cannot be a party to the non-proliferation treaty and ignore its obligations under that treaty and if a country ignores its obligations there has to be some action and some sanction.  In this case, the sanction that has been applied is that Iran has been told it should engage in discussions so that the problem is hammered out using the E3+3 format.  Iran will be permitted to use nuclear energy for peaceful energy purposes but it cannot develop nuclear weapons.  The European Union is asking Iran to engage in talks.  Ireland supports that position and we will continue to do so.  Our role in respect of the Middle East generally has been a very positive role in promoting a peaceful solution in the Middle East.  I am very proud of the fact that Ireland played a very active role in securing an agreed European Union position which is a very strong position, on the settlements issue in Palestine.  Ireland has a very strong record on that issue both within the European Union and at the United Nations.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8, 36 and 57 together.The Government remains gravely concerned at continuing reports of human rights violations being committed by armed militias in Libya.  The situation in a number of detention facilities still under the control of militias is particularly worrying.  As documented by the UN support mission for Libya, the international commission of inquiry on Libya and by Amnesty International in its most recent report, routine practices of ill-treatment, human rights abuses and torture continue to be reported.The question of how to ensure effective disarmament of the militias and restore security in Libya has been a priority concern for the outgoing Libyan interim government.  We welcome the recent decisions to place prisons under the direct authority of the judicial police and the steps being taken to provide adequate training to prosecutors and judges.  However, more needs to be done to address the situation of the estimated 4,000 detainees who are still being held by militias and to ensure full accountability for violations of human rights which, it is alleged, have been committed in Libya since the onset of last year's historic changes.  The rights of victims need to be safeguarded and not completely set aside as against the wider need to promote overall reconciliation within Libya.  This may have some implications for a recent amnesty law which has been adopted and about which the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, expressed some concerns in his briefing to the UN Security Council on 2 July.No one is under any illusion about the daunting scale of the challenges which Libya and its people face in rebuilding their country and in establishing effective institutions of government and accountability.  A good start has been made over the past year and there is no doubting the commitment of the Libyan people to create a better future for their country in which human rights and the rule of law are fully respected.  This was evident from the conduct of last weekend's elections which passed off peacefully and successfully and with a high turn-out of electors.The next step will be for the new Libyan Government and parliament to oversee the drawing up and adoption of a constitution which respects and promotes human rights for all and which will guarantee gender equality in view of the significant role played by women during the ousting of Gadaffi.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to offer support to the new caretaker government in the complex transition from a repressive regime to a new, democratic and pluralist Libya.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The Minister of State will be aware that Amnesty International has published two reports on Libya.  The first report was issued along with a UN report in March 2012.  It stated that NATO had failed to investigate the deaths of scores of civilians killed in Libya as a result of air strikes carried out by its forces.  Mr. Colm O'Gorman of the Irish branch of Amnesty International said this was unacceptable and he accused NATO of refusing to take responsibility for its actions.  He said it leaves victims and their families believing they have been forgotten and denied basic justice.  If NATO and the United Nations were as enthusiastic now as NATO was in deciding to take sides in the Libyan civil war, it might be possible to alleviate some of the problems.  The latest report from Amnesty International published on 4 July and entitled, Libya: Rule of Law or Rule of Militias?, states that nearly a year after Tripoli fell to the revolutionary fighters, ongoing violations including arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, including to death, unlawful killings and forcible displacement are casting a shadow over the country.  People from sub-Saharan Africa continue to suffer arbitrary arrest, indefinite detention, beatings which amount to torture in some cases, exploitation at the hands of armed militias.  There has been no accountability on the part of NATO with regard to the bombings.  The western powers were very keen to become involved in Libya but now they wash their hands of the situation in the country.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I would not agree that the western countries or, indeed, Ireland, are washing their hands of the situation in Libya.  That country is undergoing a period of normalisation.  Militias are still active because this has been the nature of the chaos and mayhem that occurred in the overthrow of Gadaffi and they are still in control in some parts of the country.  The interim government has stabilised the country and the elections were recognised as being fair and free by international monitors.  A total of 65% of the population voted in the election.  The government has not been established as yet but it seems it will be a liberal government.  As soon as the government is established its first function will be to produce a constitution.  A group of 60 elected representatives will produce the constitution and human rights will be included in the constitution.  However, the legacy of the war must be acknowledged and also the legacy of the militias which overthrew Gadaffi and this legacy must be dealt with.  Libya is going in the right direction and the international community is supporting it.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I hope the election of Mahmoud Jibril will prove to be positive.  I did not agree with the intervention of the western powers in Libya.  It is rarely the case that military intervention proves to be positive.  I agree with the Tánaiste in his view that a military intervention in Syria today, no more than in Iran, would be fraught with disaster.  The new president is a former financial adviser to Gadaffi's government.  He faces the resentment of the rebel commanders and the Islamic organisations.  The Minister of State referred to the sharing out of seats in the parliament.  The area in the east of the country around Benghazi is feeling pretty hard done by and there are feelings of exclusion and resentment because it has been allocated only 60 seats out of 200 seats whereas the western area of the country has been allocated 100 seats and the south has 60.  This division was obviously based on population but those in the east are feeling excluded.  The Irish Government should take note of the findings in the Amnesty International report.  It said that following the election, "as a first step to turn the page, it was looking to the General National Congress and the government it appoints to publicly admit the scale and gravity of human rights abuses, unequivocally condemn them, and send a message that such violations would no longer be tolerated."  Amnesty International's Middle East and north Africa deputy director said: "To honour the sacrifices and suffering of Libyans, those who take on the responsibility of governing the new Libya have to make clear that they intend to bring to justice and hold accountable those who have committed human rights abuses – whatever their rank or affiliation."  The Irish Government should be seeking to have this implemented in the area.

My information is that attempts are being made to ensure that the 60 person group that will write the new constitution for Libya has taken into consideration representation in the three major areas of east, west and south that considered themselves to be under-represented in the matter.  That is being dealt with at present, but I will check on it.  Ireland and the European Union have an interest in the matter.  The EU has made €36 million available for capacity building and assisting in the electoral process, as well as having an EU mission in Libya for the elections that are taking place.

In the short time available I will make a number of points about what happened at the weekend.  I am 29 years of age and one of the youngest Deputies in the Dáil.  I was at the concert by the Stone Roses and other bands in the Phoenix Park on Thursday night, and many of my peers, constituents, friends and neighbours attended the concerts in the Phoenix Park over the weekend.I wish to talk about citizenship.  Every citizen in this country who attends an entertainment or music event, a concert or a play has a right to expect to be able to do so safely and securely and to enjoy themselves.  That was not the case last Saturday.  I have spoken to people who were there.  These are young people who would generally go out at the weekends, as young people do.  They were afraid of what was happening, felt under threat and felt a sense of menace and aggression.  They had never witnessed this at a concert or a musical event previously.  Serious questions must be asked of the promoters of this event with regard to the level of security and scrutiny that took place in and around the concert and the Phoenix Park.  Were people searched?  People who were clearly intoxicated or under the influence of illegal substances were allowed into the concert.  Were they searched for weapons and so forth?We witnessed very serious, violent events.  Residents in the Castleknock and Ashtown areas also have a right to be able to go about their business safely and securely.  There was a huge amount of negative and anti-social behaviour in those areas, particularly on Saturday night.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I join my colleague in thanking the Minister for coming to the House to discuss this subject.  What happened last weekend should never be allowed to happen again.  Concerts are very lucrative events for promoters but it is time we adopted a no tolerance approach.  Does the Minister agree with that, particularly in light of the violence, abuse and the damage that occurred?  Nine people were stabbed in separate incidents, there were 33 arrests and 70 other charges of public order, drink related and drug related offences.  The footage shown on television last week caused great concern to many people.I welcome the Minister's recent statement that what happened last weekend was unusual, in the first instance, and most unacceptable.  I also read with great interest that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, indicated that the Phoenix Park should not be utilised for such concerts again.  Carrying knives in such a premeditated manner gives rise to great concern.  There is also the selling of drugs and cheap promotional alcohol, which has been the subject of much discussion in this House recently, as well as other substances.  We need to target the promoters and ask questions of the Garda.  Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient precautions were taken last weekend?  Was there adequate security and a sufficient Garda presence, including on the part of the drug and riot squads, the dog unit and the emergency response unit?  Does the Minister believe it is time to adopt a no-tolerance approach to such events?

Many years ago, I worked as a security guard at concerts but never saw intoxication at the level I saw in Chapelizod on Thursday and Friday nights.  There were people who were in no fit state to walk the streets heading to the concert.  How many of them were turned away?  Was there a drink tank where people could have recovered instead of going to the concert to have more drink and drugs?  Despite some searches by stewards, drink was brought into the concert, and this was consumed on top of the drinks sold at the concert.There was an inadequate Garda presence and inadequate stewarding in the residential areas that back onto the Phoenix Park.  I include Castleknock and Chapelizod in my constituency.  Some of the residents felt under siege given the amount of people attending the concerts.  In some cases in the past, there were significant traffic problems, but it was the number of people that constituted the problem on this occasion.  Some of the gates into the park, which were locked to try to encourage attendees to go a different way, were broken down.  There was much dumping in Chapelizod after the concerts.  Bottles and clothes of all sorts were dumped in people's gardens.  Concert-goers urinated in people's gardens and on their doors.There ought to be a meeting urgently with the OPW and concert promoters.  There is provision for several more concerts.  If they are to proceed and the same scenes are repeated, we and the relevant authorities will have failed.  I urge the Minister to ensure this meeting will happen quickly and that there will be sufficient stewarding, not only at the concerts but on the way thereto, be it by the Garda or private security companies organised by the promoters.  Residents should not suffer the consequences of concerts run for profit.  People should be allowed to come and go as they please in the residential areas.  The other users of the park should also enjoy this freedom.  The park was out of bounds for non-concertgoers in the run-up to and during the various concerts.

I am astonished that, four days after the event, nobody in MCD has been arrested.  They should be arrested and should have been arrested as early as Sunday morning given the fallout from the concert in question.  MCD has been involved in a PR exercise since Saturday night disclaiming responsibility for what happened, including the attacks, the hospitalisations and the loss of life of certain unfortunate people.MCD was granted the licence and was responsible for the security.  It sold the tickets and walked away with the profits, without even a word of sympathy for the bereaved or those who ended up in hospital.  The directors of MCD should be arrested.  Were the concerts in our neighbouring jurisdiction, the directors would have been arrested.  I refer not only to the United Kingdom but also to the rest of Europe.I am reminded of the unfortunate Stardust tragedy of 1981.  Nobody takes responsibility or accepts the blame, and no one will take the blame for what occurred at Saturday night's concert.  This is an Irish way of doing things but I do not agree with it.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on it.MCD has not issued a single word of sympathy in any newspaper or statement.  It could not even bring itself to sympathise with the Brophy family in County Laois who buried their 21-year-old son Shane this morning.  What about the young man from Clonsilla, Lee Scanlon?  Is his family not entitled to a word of condolence, at the least?  I extend my condolences, as I am sure do other Members.  I also extend my condolences to those who ended up in hospital with very serious injuries.MCD has quite serious questions to answer.  The promoters should be arrested.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I thank the Deputies for raising what is clearly a matter of great public concern.  I share people's shock and concern over the series of disturbing incidents that took place at a concert in the Phoenix Park last Saturday night.  Unfortunately, a number of people engaged in disgraceful and unacceptable conduct.I am sure Deputies will appreciate that as a number of people are facing charges as a result of what happened on Saturday night, nothing should be said in this House that might prejudice criminal proceedings.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I must be particularly careful about what I say in that context.It is true that a number of concerts have been held in relatively trouble-free circumstances at the Phoenix Park previously.  Therefore, it is important to clarify whether there are particular circumstances surrounding this concert that may have given rise to difficulties.  The Garda is reviewing what happened and held an initial meeting with the concert promoters in this context yesterday.  I understand that the meeting was useful and that a range of issues was discussed surrounding the event, including those matters of serious concern that are in the public domain, including some of those raised this afternoon.  It was agreed that both organisations will carry out a more in-depth review regarding all aspects of the event.  The fact is that the arrangements in place on Saturday night did not prevent the type of behaviour that took place.  By that reality, it is clear they were not adequate.I have, of course, been briefed by the Garda Commissioner on Saturday night's events, and we have discussed them on more than one occasion.  He will let me have a detailed report following the review that is being undertaken.  I am determined that any lessons that can be learned from what happened will be taken fully into account in planning future events.  Without commenting in advance of the Commissioner's report on specific arrangements for security at last Saturday's concert, it is worth noting more generally that developments will be taking place in the near future regarding the licensing of the event security sector.The Private Security Authority regulates the private security industry in the State.  Since its inception, it has introduced licensing on a phased basis into various areas of the private security sector.  For example, it already licenses both contractors and employees providing door supervisor and security guard services.  Many of those working in event security are therefore already licensed and, accordingly, have to meet certain standards or acquire certain qualifications.In addition to having a role regarding the existing requirements, I have been working for some time on regulations that will lead to the licensing of all individuals working in the event security sector.  I expect to finalise those regulations shortly.  The Private Security Authority proposes to license all contractors working in the event security area by autumn 2012.While the vast majority of people who attend concerts and similar events just want to enjoy themselves, I am concerned that the behaviour of a significant number of people at the Phoenix Park last Saturday was clearly unacceptable by any standards.  Unfortunately, this was reflected in the number of arrests the Garda had to make.  I have had occasion to comment recently on the degree to which excessive alcohol consumption contributes to public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  The events of Saturday must underline the need for us all, as a society, to acknowledge the damage which the misuse of alcohol can cause.Clearly, we all wish that summer-time concerts and similar events would be a time for celebration and enjoyment, especially for young people, not occasions of widespread public disorder.  Nor should such events present a threatening atmosphere for those who conduct themselves well while attending them.For my part as Minister, I will do all in my power to improve our regulatory framework and I have previously stated my intention to introduce additional regulations that will aim to curb the level of excessive drinking.  I expect those regulations to be brought into force towards the end of this year.  It is also clear that drug taking among concert goers contributed to the disorder that took place.  Certainly, one of the issues that the review will have to address is whether sufficient measures were in place to prevent this.  I personally received reports of drugs being openly sold during the concert event with no intervention by the personnel who were supposed to be providing security.While I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the Garda Commissioner's review, it seems to me that a comprehensive risk assessment has to form part of planning for any event.  The reality is that not all concerts pose the same type of issues and we will have to ensure that processes are flexible enough to address that.  Put simply, if licences are to be granted, conditions will have to reflect fully a comprehensive risk assessment that takes into account the profile of persons likely to attend any particular type of concert.  A relevant issue is the performers and what crowd it is anticipated they will attract.  I am not convinced that was adequately assessed by the licensing authority in advance of this particular concert.  On the one hand, we have to allow people to enjoy themselves; on the other, we have to be realistic about addressing the public order risks involved.The Garda will continue to have my full support in upholding public order for the benefit of the law-abiding majority of our people.  It is right that I should make it clear that the Garda is determined to pursue fully anyone who engaged in criminal behaviour last Saturday night.

I express my condolences to the families that lost loved ones this weekend, including the Scanlons.  Will the Minister assure residents in the Castleknock-Ashtown area that something like this will never be allowed to recur and that MCD will not be granted licences for future events of this type unless it can guarantee the security and safety of attendees in so far as is practicable?  The tickets were expensive, €60 and upwards.  Given that people spent a great deal of money in these difficult times, the least they can expect is that they, their children or loved ones can attend concerts safely.Will the Minister elaborate on his discussions with the Garda Commissioner?  Is the Commissioner satisfied that sufficient numbers of gardaí were in the vicinity of the Phoenix Park on Saturday night?  If not, why?

I will focus on future security.  Would airport-type security be appropriate for such events?  Many events are held in Ireland, but not all of them have large attendances.  Some are only attended by thousands.  Often, we attend local football matches.  Where violence can be expected, airport-type security measures might be appropriate.  Has the Minister an opinion in this regard, particularly given the events of last weekend and their implication for further concerts this summer in Marley Park and the Phoenix Park that will attract similarly large crowds?

What can be done to deal with concert goers who are patently unable to enjoy themselves at a concert and can no more walk than they can crawl?  I saw such scenes.  Some measure must be implemented so that such people can be turned away or placed in a drink tank or recovery unit.  What can be done to ensure an increased Garda presence or stewarding in the vicinity of concerts?  Many years ago when I attended the Trip to Tipp, Slane or the likes, one of the conditions was that concert organisers would pay for stewards in the local towns or residential areas.  However, this does not seem to have been the case in Chapelizod.  An increased presence in surrounding areas is necessary if similar concerts are to proceed in future.

As to attributing blame, the promoters have made efforts to distract attention from their responsibilities and divert it towards the Office of Public Works, the Garda and Dublin City Council.  I do not accept that, as those groups' responsibility in this matter is minimal.The Minister has reservations in terms of what he can say, given the legal position, but I concur with his comments on those who injure people etc. in that the law should take its normal course.  The law applies equally to those who made money from the concert and those who committed offences there.  The promoters have questions to answer, as they were responsible for the concert and its security.  Had there been proper security, we would not be having this discussion.  MCD should not be granted further licences, given the loss of life at this event.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I thank Deputies for their comments, some of which were constructive.  I want to emphasise that this is a matter of very substantial concern to me.  I want to give Deputies some insight into the security arrangements.  I am told that the promoters had 511 security personnel present on the occasion of the concert on Saturday evening.  That number actually exceeded the number that their licence required them to provide that night.  Quite clearly, based on the nature of the concert that took place, it appears as if that was inadequate, but I want to be careful not to pre-judge what is going to come from the Garda Commissioner.The Garda Síochána had 158 members engaged in providing policing services that night.  This compares with the 122 gardaí required on the night of the event that preceded the Saturday night concert.  There was another concert on Sunday evening at which there were 122 members of An Garda Síochána.I have a variety of concerns.  Essentially, this concert could, because of the profile of the young people who attended it, in other circumstances have been described as a rave.  It was that type of an event.  It was a different event than the event that took place on the Thursday or the Sunday evening.  I am concerned that the licensing authority did not have adequate regard to the age of those who were attending the concert and the heightened possibility of difficulty that arose from those who were both playing in the concert and those who followed the individuals who were playing the concert.  I am not saying that as a criticism of the musicians themselves.  I am very conscious that there is an age divide between many of us in this House and those who attended the concert.  Perhaps not quite in respect of Deputy Nulty, but perhaps in the context of the rest of us.  That was a concern.As to the issue of whether we can give an assurance to the local community to the effect that this will not happen again, the Garda Commissioner is conducting his review and I am expecting some recommendations to emerge out of it that should provide for, for example, additional conditions to be imposed on promoters of concerts in the Phoenix Park.  I do not want to rule out concerts in the Phoenix Park.  There was not this level of difficulty with the Sunday and Thursday evening concerts and it would be unfair to rule concerts out in their entirety.  I take the view that promoters have a responsibility to ensure that those who attend concerts can do so safely, that there is no sense of menace and that individuals who clearly should not be admitted are not admitted.  I am not convinced enough was done to ensure that those who were seriously inebriated prior to the concert or those who were clearly and visibly under the influence of drugs were excluded from the concert.  It should be made clear in future that individuals in that condition will be excluded.I am concerned that the security arrangements at the concert may have been more focused on ensuring individuals did not bring drink into the concert, thereby reducing the commercial benefit to the promoters of the drinks sold at the concert, than the protection of people present at the concert.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	380	That is a specific issue that must be seriously addressed.Deputy Keating raised the issue of airport-type security.  The difficulty, I have been told, with this concert is that there was a large number of young people sitting around drinking in the Phoenix Park immediately before the concert, with the gates only opened a half hour before the performance so that 40,000 to 45,000 people could enter.  The gates should have been opened much earlier and the approach taken to alcohol - an issue relevant not just to the concert promoters - resulted in many young people drinking cans of alcohol at a rapid rate before gaining entry.  That was because they feared that the alcohol would be confiscated.The promoters should apologise for the level of disorder at the concert to the vast majority of people who were law-abiding and attended the event in the hope of having an enjoyable occasion.  It is worth mentioning that although, unfortunately, we have seen a series of recent incidents where trouble and violence was fuelled by young people drinking to excess and taking illegal drugs, the problem is not a matter of law and order, and it is not confined to this event.  The issue requires action by parents, educators and those who sell alcohol, not only in public houses but across the retail sector.For my part, in the coming months I will be putting in place regulations aimed at addressing the problem of excessive drinking.  The Deputies have helpfully outlined a number of the concerns arising from Saturday night's events and I will take whatever action is open to me and required when I receive the Garda Commissioner's report.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	381	As the Minister knows, no justice system is perfect and delays in family court hearings, with the consequent negative impact on women and children in particular, is an Irish scandal.  I have been approached by a number of constituents, leading family solicitors and women's organisations, all claiming there is a serious backlog in maintenance applications.The picture being painted by the people in contact with me is of a system in complete disarray, with many women and children living in poverty and on the edge.  Several women have stated that they feel they are being gagged by the family law courts.  They are frustrated that they are not allowed to speak out.  I appreciate that family law cases are held in camera and I respect the rule but it can be manipulated against the applicant, and often legal people can get away with very unprofessional behaviour while still charging top dollar.I would appreciate if the Minister could reply to the following questions.  Is it correct that women and children are being left to wait for up to one year for hearing dates for emergency maintenance applications in the family law courts?  These women often do not know where they will get money to pay for basics like food, clothing and doctor bills.  How many judges short is the District and Circuit Court system, and is it true that criminal cases take precedence over family law cases?  Are judges of the Circuit Court, in Dublin particularly, being regularly seconded from urgent family law hearings to sit in the criminal courts?Is it correct that a judge was recently taken from the family law Circuit Court hearings at Phoenix House in Dublin to hear the high-profile prosecution case of a former personal assistant to a millionaire?  That was done at the expense of hundreds of maintenance and other family law-type hearings.  Is it true that even when dates are given for family law case hearings, particularly maintenance applications on behalf of women and children, these cases are repeatedly adjourned?  Why is that?  Why are cases being listed for hearing and expensive legal teams being brought to court when it is clear those cases will not be heard?  Women seeking maintenance often emerge from family law court hearings that have been adjourned with a hefty legal bill and no maintenance payments.What is the timeframe for the hearing of maintenance cases at Phoenix House family law Circuit Court in Dublin?  Will some form of emergency interim system be put in place to address the thousands of unheard maintenance applications, where women and children are being left on the poverty line while the husbands are allowed to do whatever they want with their salaries until the cases reach the court?  What is the extent of the backlogs in family law hearings in each of the courts?Will adequate consultation facilities be provided in family law courts in recognition of the sensitive nature of these issues?  Currently, consultation often takes place in corridors and in corners, which is unacceptable.  The many women and some men who have contacted me have spoken about the stress and animosity that Irish family law cases can cause between family members, not to mention the significant financial burden that arises.  As the natural primary and fundamental units in Irish society, families - including women, children and men - deserve better.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Deputy has raised an issue that has been a concern of mine for many years.  The difficult reality is that we have within our courts system no separate court to deal with family law matters, unlike the separate unified system of family courts in Australia.  Within the District and Circuit Court there are separate court sittings dealing with family law issues, and the High Court sits separately to deal with family law applications.In the context of the issue raised by the Deputy, I am not aware of there being "thousands of maintenance cases", so described, in which women are awaiting emergency maintenance orders sitting in a court backlog.  I am not aware either that if there is a need for emergency maintenance, it would take a year for a determination to be made.  If the Deputy has particular cases where that has occurred, I ask her to draw them to my attention or table a question on the timeframe.I am aware that in the District Court it may take a number of weeks if not some months for maintenance cases to be determined.  Where there is a need for emergency maintenance within the courts, there are procedures for the making of an application for what is known as interim maintenance and for interim maintenance orders to be granted.  That applies across the courts system.I share the Deputy's concern with regard to what is known as the in camera rule, which was put in place many years ago to ensure that those who experience family difficulties may have their family law proceedings determined in circumstances of anonymity and that they are not in any way intimidated out of taking matters to court because the family story might appear in the newspapers to the embarrassment of the people in question or the detriment of their children’s welfare.  The in camera rule means there is little public knowledge of the manner in which family cases are determined within the courts system, and there is no transparency in the manner in which members of the Judiciary deal with family matters.  The Circuit Court particularly deals with a substantial majority of the separation and divorce cases, and the District Court deals with an overwhelming majority of the maintenance and barring order cases.  There is no repository of judgments delivered by members of the Judiciary detailing the approach taken by them in applying the very detailed legal principles of relevance.  It is my intention to introduce legislation to provide for reform in this area so we have greater transparency in family court proceedings with the possibility of reporting while still protecting the anonymity of the individuals engaged in such proceedings.The Deputy is aware that as part of the programme for Government we provide for a unified system of family courts the nature of which we do not have in the State at present.  The establishment of such courts is crucial if we are to ensure family law is addressed in a manner that is appropriate in the 21st century and provides the courts with the standard backup services dealing with child welfare issues such as are available in other jurisdictions and which perhaps replicate what is available in the family court system in Australia.  I am happy to tell the Deputy initial work has been completed in this area and I expect to make an announcement shortly having made certain proposals to Cabinet.  If we are to establish such a unified family court system it will require a constitutional referendum and it is anticipated this referendum will take place some time during 2013 when the more detailed work required in the area has been completed.

In particular I ask the Minister to examine the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill which will make it an offence to withhold information.  Often in circumstances of domestic violence the mother lacks the capacity or courage to report the abuse of her child.  This rule should not be applied too rigidly in domestic violence situations.  I accept it is the job of parents to protect their children but for some women this is not possible.  A woman who has been the victim of domestic violence often cannot protect herself or her child.  To apply this rule too rigidly would make criminals out of mothers.  I am also concerned that abused women will stop seeking advice from support groups such as Women's Aid or their friends and family.  People will keep their situations secret to avoid reporting.In the past the Probation and Welfare Service worked with the District Court family law courts.  The relationship between the probation services and the courts ceased and no other agency was put in place to deal with these issues.  As a result judges are often placed in an impossible situation.  They need to determine the issue of access without the views of the child being heard.  To make matters worse, if an order for access is not being obeyed it is the mother's fault.  The mother is summoned before the court and may be committed to prison for breaching the order, again making a criminal of the victim.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill is under consideration by the House with Report and Final Stages to be considered tomorrow.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to ensure there is an obligation on persons who have knowledge of all serious offences, including sexual offences against children or vulnerable adults, to inform the Garda.  In drafting the Bill I also have to be very mindful of the fact that the balance of evidence suggests the majority of abuse of children or vulnerable adults takes place in the person's own home.  The Bill applies to all persons, to all organisations and to all sectors of society.  It is very important that we produce legislation that affords protection from abuse to children or vulnerable persons, in any scenario or in any location.  This is what the Bill is about.  It also must be borne in mind that existing provisions in the criminal law for the protection of children continue to apply.  This includes section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which makes it an offence for a person with authority or control over a child, such as a parent, to intentionally or recklessly endanger a child by causing or permitting a child to be placed or left in a situation which creates a substantial risk to the child of being a victim of serious harm or sexual abuse.  I therefore do not believe that the Bill significantly alters the responsibilities of a parent under the law.  However, the Bill also establishes some limited defences for persons such as a parent or guardian or medical professional who, acting in the interests of the health and well-being of the child or vulnerable person, fails to make a report to the Garda.  The Bill also includes a defence of reasonable excuse.  This provision would cater for the type of situation referred to by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor where a parent may also be a victim of violence and may be too frightened and intimidated by a violent partner to go to the Garda.  The Members of this House are aware the Bill is an important provision in the suite of legislation we are bringing into force to protect children.The Probation Service, known as the Probation and Welfare Service many years ago, provided child welfare reports to the District Court to assist District Court judges make decisions on issues relating to custody and access.  Unfortunately, many years ago the then Government ended this function of the Probation Service.  There is a gap in the District Court and Circuit Court systems in that I believe the courts require the assistance which can be provided by child assessments in making determinations in this area.  It is an issue that will be addressed in the context of the legislation to establish family courts.  It will be a difficult issue to address in the context of the limited resources currently available.  However, I am determined to address the issue and ensure the gap which exists in this area is adequately filled during the lifetime of the Government.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I thank the Minister for attending the House.  With regard to the report published by the Commission for Energy Regulation on 29 June 2012, I wish specifically to highlight how it impacts on my constituency and on the Ballylongford landbank which, unbeknown to many people in the House and country, is the second deepest water port in the entirety of Europe.  Unfortunately, it has been the subject of many false dawns to date.  In the 1970s Aran Energy considered building an oil refinery on this piece of land.  With some foresight, the State has taken a landbank of approximately 600 acres which if it existed in any other part of Europe would be the site of great industry and employment.  With respect, I must state I am disappointed not so much with the findings but with how the matter has played out since 2001.  In 2001 the then Minister with responsibility for enterprise decided we needed a new interconnector between Ireland and the UK with the capacity to transport 22 million cu. m of gas per day.  This was built and in 2002 the regulator took control of the market.The Department of the Taoiseach commissioned a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2009.  Our regulator is independent and a public agency.  A table reveals a considerable variety in the legal status of European regulators and the independence of energy regulators.  In Ireland and Portugal they are independent public agencies.  To this end complete responsibility lies with the independent regulator who faces consequences for making judgments deemed to be inappropriate.  Will the Minister highlight how he can ask the Judiciary to rule on this if needs be and how we can act within the EU Commissioner's regulations?In 2005 the regulator decided a tariff regime was needed for external sources, because at the time 95% of our gas was coming from the State-owned interconnectors and the ring main, with 5% coming from Kinsale.  The Corrib gas field was coming on stream and at the time the regulator was under no illusion about having to put a tariff in place.  In 2006, Hess Engineering, along with Shannon LNG, looked at developing the Ballylongford site for the purpose of a gas LNG plant which would bring an investment of between €600 million and €1 billion to our country.  This would bring foreign moneys, create jobs and provide a positive start to energy provision which would ultimately realise more jobs in Kerry Group and the Tarbert fuel station which would now become a gas generating station.  This would be positive for the country and for north Kerry.  It is now 2012 and the issues are still not resolved.  Eleven years have passed since the first proposals were made and the timeframe now proposed for a resolution by the regulator is October 2014.  This is unacceptable.  It is not the kind of conduct one would expect in a commercial and viable country.I am not happy with the conduct of the regulator.  I understand the issue is highly complex but many people do not understand that. It is time the issue was brought to a conclusion.  I have made recommendations to Bord Gáis Networks, to Shannon LNG and to members of the committee dealing with transport, communications and energy on the need for a special Oireachtas committee meeting to discuss whether a judicial review is warranted as a result of the tariffs being proposed.  The Brattle Group, which is commissioned by governments and independent gas companies throughout the world, has referred to the situation here.  It stated that in terms of process and managing legitimate expectation, the CER does not seem to have followed best practice.  The CER presented four options in a July 2011 consultation paper and has rejected all of those subsequently.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank Deputy Spring for raising this issue, in which he has shown a keen interest for some time.  I welcome the opportunity to update him and Members of the House on this important issue.  The matter raised relates to the decision published by the Commission for Energy Regulation on 29 June last, relating to the regulatory treatment of the BGE interconnectors and the future gas transmission tariff regime.  I trust that this high level decision provides a degree of regulatory certainty that has been sought by all stakeholders, including Shannon LNG.I have consistently welcomed the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Such a facility, together with the bringing onshore of Corrib gas would provide important security of gas supply for Ireland.  I met the promoters of the project soon after taking office and both my Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation are in regular contact with Shannon LNG.  Together with all players and potential players in Ireland's gas market, Shannon LNG has a key commercial interest in the outcome of the CER's decision on this complex regulatory question and, given the complexities, there are many differing perspectives on what the decision should be.The decision on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors is by law a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  The regulator, as the independent energy regulator, has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  It also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.  Over the past number of months, the CER has been engaged in an extensive consultation process on the matter and has had considerable interaction with Shannon LNG as well as with all key stakeholders.  The publication by the CER, on 17 February last, of a proposed decision paper for consultation was followed by the assessment of stakeholder submissions by the CER and meetings with several individual stakeholders,  including Shannon LNG.The CER's high level decision, published on 29 June, concludes that the current gas transmission entry tariff regime must be reformed in the light of new sources of gas, such as Corrib and Shannon LNG, coming on stream.  The interconnector entry tariff plays a crucial role in determining Irish gas wholesale prices for all customers.  Without reform of the system, the reduced flows of gas through the interconnectors due to new sources of gas coming on stream could lead to significant increases in the per unit interconnector tariff.  In turn, this would push up prices for gas consumers in Ireland.  The decision commits the CER to the setting of tariffs at each entry point.  Tariffs will be set separately on the basis of forward looking long run marginal cost, LRMC, considerations.  The new tariff regime is expected to come into effect in October 2014.The CER has decided that a network tariffs liaison group, involving stakeholders, will be established.  The purpose of the group will be to inform the regulator's future decisions on the methodology for setting the LRMC tariffs for each entry point.  Following a decision by the regulator on the methodology to apply, the CER will then issue a direction to Gaslink to effect these reforms.  I very much hope that all stakeholders, including Shannon LNG, will continue to work with the CER on this issue.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	389	This matter must be resolved.  To put it in context, under the strategic infrastructural planning rules in this country, in 2006 Shannon LNG achieved planning permission within six months.  However, it took the regulator 18 months to analyse that decision and now it seems that it will be 2014 before any project gets off the ground.  There is no certainty surrounding this and for anybody considering making a substantial investment of between €600 million and €1 billion the figures must be provided with regard to the proposed tariff.  Any business plan must be able to be promoted so that a decision can be made on whether it will go ahead.  The liaison group should be set up immediately and should be required to resolve the matter within the next six months.  Then Hess and LNG can commit or not to tendering for the project.A report of The Economist  intelligence unit produced for the Department of the Taoiseach in 2009 stated that evidence that energy prices in Ireland are high by international standards raises potential questions about the effectiveness of the regulatory regime in the absence of some alternative explanation for such high prices and that the regulator’s job is not to set artificially low prices but to ensure that the customers are not paying for more or less than they would in competitive markets.  It is high time we took a look at how our system works and separated how Bord Gáis networks work and how private investors can consider creating jobs and reducing the price of energy, ultimately creating competitiveness for the consumer and for the national well-being.  Some 65% of the electricity that is created in this country is from gas.  I welcome better sources, but the process is too slow.  Action by the regulator since 2002 is unacceptable and the regulatory system needs to be improved to that end.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	390	As a matter of coincidence, the International Energy Agency published its review today of the effectiveness, efficiency and competitiveness of the Irish energy sector.  The executive director from Paris was here to launch that document and the conclusions of the review find the work of the Irish regulator praiseworthy.I accept the point made by Deputy Spring and inform him that within days the letters will issue to ensure that the network tariffs liaison group will be set up to commence the process.  It is a matter for others as to how quickly they will respond to that.  I am, to some extent, in the dark in that since the regulator made its decision on 29 June, I have not had any response from the company.  Neither has the regulator had a response, to my knowledge.  I hope that is a good sign and I also hope the company is engaging with the decision.  I am disappointed to hear Deputy Spring say that he thinks the decision will not bring the necessary regulatory certainty.  Getting the decision had been delayed by actions of the company, in terms of making complaints to Europe.  Nonetheless, the regulator published its decision on 29 June, with the purpose of giving regulatory certainty.  I take some hope from the fact that the company has not made any reaction to me or the regulator that it will engage in private with the regulator in terms of assessing what precisely are the implications of what is, as Deputy Spring said, a highly complex area.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting what is an extremely important topical issue in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  In fact, I can conservatively say that 50-plus jobs are on the line today as a result of the new N4 Downes interchange and the ongoing works.  The works, which were initiated in 2008, are not the problem and I welcome the investment by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of in excess of €14 million in this project.  It was an extremely dangerous junction which, unfortunately, saw many fatalities.  What is happening now is the issue.Despite previous assurances from the local authority and the contractors that the medians on this stretch of road would remain open until the flyover was erected, unfortunately, they have not be adhered to.  I will give the Minister the history of the issue.  Originally, a Part 8 process was embarked upon and the council officials engaged with the vested interests, including businesses and landowners, and advised them that they would maintain the medians on the road in order to provide access to businesses and for local residents during the construction phase.Extra money became available through the National Roads Authority but, unfortunately, there was a need to re-advertise and go through the Part 8 process again.  At no stage was the fact that the medians would close mentioned.  A number of business have met the local authority officials and the project office and they have been advised that a number of medians will close on 16 July and the remaining ones will close on 22 August, but the bridge has not been opened.  The bridge will be under construction until December of this year.  It was understood there was a provision in the agreement with the contractors that reasonable access would be provided to businesses while the works were being carried out but this appears to have been completely ignored.It is unfortunate the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport cannot be here because he turned the sod on this project and I am sure he is quite familiar with it.  I will take the Thomas Flynn and Sons site as an example.  Under the current regime, to close the median gaps westbound, N4 traffic with a destination at Flynn's would be required to divert more than 10 km via the N52 interchange to the east of Mullingar.  Eastbound, N4 traffic would similarly be required to divert approximately 5 km via the interchange junction near Coralstown.  It is a serious inconvenience to people using this route.  These people have engaged Traffic Wise Consultants and they have come up with a comprehensive suggestion and a compromise for the council.  I understand the council would be willing to engage and take it on board were it not for the NRA which has put in a condition that the contract and the money must be drawn down by the end of December this year.Will the Minister ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to instruct NRA officials to engage positively with council officials to ensure what needs to be done at a relatively low cost to maintain the 50-plus jobs at these business is done?  We suffered 45 job losses in the town of Mullingar yesterday and we do not want to see 50 jobs lost for want of positive engagement with an arm of this State.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I thank the Deputy for raising this important local issue.  I am standing in for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and I will undertake to bring the Deputy's views directly to his attention.While the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme, the construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a statutory function of the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Section 17 of the principal Act indicates that it shall be the general duty of the authority to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  This section of road is on a major through route for traffic between Dublin and the west, a route that serves most of the north west from parts of Donegal down into Roscommon, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  Most importantly, this section comes at the end of motorway and dual carriageway standard roads all the way from Dublin's M50.  Motorists travelling this route are suddenly faced with traffic crossing ahead of them in right turning manoeuvres.  This scenario is repeated at several locations in quick succession.  Such turning manoeuvres are recognised to be among the most hazardous and more likely to lead to death or serious injury in any resultant collision.  The NRA recognised the dangers in these particular circumstances and has chosen, even in the face of a severely constrained budget, to devote funding to this project.  It is one of only the few national roads projects under way.I understand the scheme involves the construction of a new grade separated junction, a footbridge for pedestrians across the dual carriageway, the elimination of the median crossings and the construction of hard shoulders.  These measures, in particular the closure of the median crossing, are designed to improve the safety of road users along this section of the N4.  The scheme is being implemented by Westmeath County Council, which designed the scheme over an extended period.  This included meetings with the public, affected landowners and local business people.  Various alternative design options were examined and public consultation meetings were held by the council on its proposals in October 2007 and February 2008.  One local business made a request for a left in only access to its premises which front onto this road.  This was considered by Westmeath County Council and its consultants at the design stage.  However, this option was ruled out for reasons of traffic safety, particularly in regard to the proximity of the westbound on-ramp for the new grade separated junction.When completed, these improvement works will provide access to the particular premises via the new grade separated junction and new access roads that will be constructed as part of the scheme to provide access to businesses and properties whose existing entrances will be affected.  The new junction layout complies with NRA national road design standards and is typical of junctions used on motorways and dual carriageways throughout the network.  The junction design offers high standards of safety for traffic entering and leaving motorways and dual carriageways.I understand from the NRA that the additional travel distance to the business premises for traffic conning from Dublin is minimal, with east bound traffic only slightly more inconvenienced.  However, I must note that any inconvenience caused to either the staff or potential customers by the new access arrangements is more than offset by the very significant road safety benefits deriving from the removal of the at-grade junctions and the provision of full grade separated access arrangements which will provide far safer access for all concerned.I appreciate that there can be disruption to individuals and businesses during the construction phase of a project such as this.  However, the issue of the sequencing of individual elements of the construction process and how they are carried through is a matter for the NRA, the local authority and the contractor concerned.  Notwithstanding this, the Department has made the NRA aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy.  In this context, I would expect that Westmeath County Council will try to keep inconvenience to a minimum while appreciating that the council and the contractor have to take account of health and safety considerations for motorists and construction workers on what is a very busy active roadway.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Westmeath County Council is trying, within reason, to minimise the inconvenience caused to the businesses and local people who use this stretch of road and are affected by this.The NRA is the funding master, to whom Westmeath County Council will go for the cheque at the end of the year.  It has dictated that this section of road must be completed by the end of December 2012.  The contractor is saying that cannot be done without closing the medians, one in July and one in August.  This will result in a four month period when a severe diversion, 10 km in one direction and 5 km in the other, will be required.  The local business people have engaged traffic consultants and have made a proposal, identical to that originally suggested by the local authority and by SIAC, the contractor, that the medians remain open until the bridge is completed.We ask that the NRA allow the additional time needed, which might be a month or two, running up to February 2013, to allow the work to be completed, to keep the medians open and support the 50 jobs that are on the line at present.The Government has, rightly, prioritised job creation.  Fifty jobs are on the line here.  The Minister for Transport turned the sod on this project.  He must not turn the key on four businesses and see 50 job losses, simply because the NRA is unaccommodating.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to have his officials consult with Westmeath County Council to bring about a satisfactory conclusion and support the 50 jobs that are on the line.

I know he was otherwise detained earlier today.I have said most of what I have to say on this amendment.  It deals with fast accrual pensions and mostly affects the boys in uniform - prison officers, gardaí and members of the Defence Forces and fire brigades - about whom the Minister spoke so nicely during the debate on Committee Stage.Prison officers' representatives in the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, and the Civil Public and Services Union, CPSU, are saying one thing to public representatives and the Minister is saying something slightly different.  It was indicated before the sos that the Minister recently wrote to the respective unions setting out the case and had not had a reply to that letter.  Will the Minister provide Opposition spokespeople with copies of his letter so that we understand the context?  We were not aware of the letter and it would be helpful to see it.  We are debating the issue slightly on the blind side, not being aware of the correspondence.  It would be helpful if we could see copies of it.

I have met representatives of the unions and my officials have met unions, in groups or individually, to discuss this matter.Before the sos, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, indicated that an assistant secretary of my Department had written to a number of secretaries general on this matter.  I will ask the assistant secretary to clear with the secretaries general if they have any objection to the correspondence being released.  I certainly have no objection to its being sent to Deputy Fleming or to any interested Deputy.  Subject to no objection being raised by the secretaries general or the Prison Officers Association, the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants, the Garda Representative Association, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and SIPTU, I will do that.

In page 45, to delete lines 28 to 43 and in page 46, to delete lines 1 to 22.We are opposed to the switch to linking pensions to the consumer price index.  It will leave public sector pensioners worse off in the future.  The current scheme includes a guaranteed link between public sector pensions and public service pay.  That link is to be broken and pensions are to be linked to the more vague and volatile consumer price index.We are also concerned that the Minister is to have discretion as to when increases related to the consumer price index will be paid.During the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister gave an assurance that this would not be a problem.  It seems, however, that the legislation allows the Minister not to grant pension increases.  The power is entirely in the Minister's hands.  There is, at least, the possibility of a lag between a rise in the consumer price index and the granting of a public service pension increase.  Pension increases will not be automatically linked to the CPI but will be at the whim of the Minister of the day.  That is a problem.The savings the Government expects to make from this change are significant.  It is difficult to see how such significant savings could be projected from this measure if it did not mean a worsening of the pension entitlements of public sector pensioners in the future.We are opposed to anything that would degrade the quality of the pensions of ordinary public sector pensioners.  We would not have a difficulty if these changes were aimed at the top earners in the public service.  In fact, we would welcome that.  This is going to hit ordinary public and civil servants and degrade the quality of their pensions in the future.  This is unacceptable and we oppose this measure.  We believe the  status quo should be retained.

While most people understood that the Bill exclusively deals with new entrants to the public service, section 47 enables the Minister to change current public service pension schemes to reflect the consumer price index, CPI.  This is not a matter we have discussed on Second Stage or Committee Stage, although I acknowledge that the Minister referred to it in his Second Stage speech.  I have consulted public sector unions on this section and found that they were not fully tuned into it.  That may not be the Minister's fault.

The estimated savings comprise €1 billion from linking future pension schemes to the CPI as opposed to salary increases, €500 million from changing to career averaging and €300 million from the later pension age.  I imagine the savings to be made if this section is implemented would greatly exceed those figures.I believe that one of the reasons why public servants who knew about section 47 are not overly concerned about it is because pensions are covered by the Croke Park agreement.  The Minister would be in breach of the agreement if he tried to implement the section now and, as he supports the agreement, we know he will not do so this year or next year.  That begs the question of why the Minister included the section in the Bill in the first place.  The issue of pensions for current public servants should be discussed in the context of negotiations on a successor to the Croke Park deal and the legislation could be amended at that stage.  It is quite something for the Minister to give himself the power to change the fundamental basis on which pensions are paid to public servants 18 months before the end of the Croke Park agreement.  The vast majority of public servants are not even aware that such powers are included in the Bill.  The provision is not needed, although the Minister may decide he needs it at a future date.  It certainly cannot be implemented while the Croke Park agreement is still in place.  The Minister has indicated that the provision would be implemented by a draft order requiring the approval by the Oireachtas but the Government has a majority and does not need to reach agreement with the Opposition or public sector unions.The current arrangements linking pay and pensions are the result of various labour conciliation agreements over a lengthy period of time.  There is a clear understanding in labour negotiations that one is linked to the other.  Even in the absence of Croke Park, the Government would be unilaterally breaching these agreements by implementing the section.  These provisions could happily be parked for the next year or 18 months.  Even at that stage it might not be possible to change the arrangements for the 300,000 public servants currently employed because these issues are covered by conciliation agreements that one hopes the Government would not unilaterally breach.  If anything is to change in this area I hope it will only happen through negotiation.  Like any good employer, the Government should only change terms and conditions of employment through consultation and agreement.I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 37 and delete the section.  If need be, we can revisit the issue this time next year.  We are fundamentally opposed to the section because it is not needed at this stage.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I tabled amendment No. 35 to remove much of the discretion provided to the Minister in the Bill.  Whatever Members may think about the rights and wrongs of using the CPI to calculate increases in pensions, if that is the chosen course it should be stated simply and unambiguously.  There is no need for all the caveats and staged examinations set out in the Bill.  My amendment simply seeks to strike out all the discretionary verbiage and replace it with the phrase: "Pensions payable under the Scheme shall be indexed in line with the Consumer Price Index."  That is as clear as water.The Minister will understand why people become anxious when they see a staged process which allows him to decide when increases in pension are to be paid, having regard to movements in the CPI.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett indicated, the Bill as it stands provides the potential for considerable stalling and, ultimately, non-payment of increases.  If this is the Minister's chosen methodology, I do not understand why he cannot state it simply and clearly rather than introducing an elongated process which allows him and his successor too many outs.Like Deputy Sean Fleming, I have proposed to remove the enabling clause in section 47 from the Bill.  I discussed the issue of retrospection with the Minister's colleague and he will be happy to hear that she held the line valiantly by categorically ruling out retrospection for those with large pensions - more is the pity.   The inconsistency here is that whereas one cannot retrospectively meddle with the high rollers, the Minister wants an enabling provision that makes a material difference to current pension holders.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	411	The Minister should let me finish and he will then have his opportunity.  I wanted to point out that inconsistency.  When this debate started initially around a new pension scheme and a single scheme, it would have made more sense to have a single scheme that encompassed those currently working in the service and new entrants.  Logically, that would have been more equitable.  It would have made a difficult piece or work all the more difficult but it would have been the way to proceed.  The Minister chose not to do that, however.  Time out of number, he chose to say that this is about new entrants.  He has insisted on exceptions in respect of Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, which I think is a bad move on the Minister's part but that is his chosen course.  He has been very much wedded to this notion of new entrants entering into the pension scheme from day one.  The Minister cannot have it both ways, however.  This enabling clause flies in the face of his new entrants line and it also flies in the face of his refusal on retrospection concerning very large pension pots.This provision should be removed.  If there is a case to be made by the Minister independently for the application of CPI to current pension holders, he should make that case separately.  Let us have that debate but it should not be inserted in this legislation.  The amendment therefore seeks to strike it out.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I thank Deputies again for their comments but we are trampling ground that has been well trampled in long debates on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 33, proposed by the United Left Alliance Deputies, seeks to delete section 40.  That section sets out how pensions are to be increased referable to the consumer price index.  If that is deleted, there is no appropriate way left in the Bill to increase pensions.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	414	No.  It must be remembered that the new regime would be included.  As I have advised the House previously, it is appropriate to give effect to this in primary legislation.  How it is to be done should be laid out clearly, which is done in section 40.  For the avoidance of doubt, if Deputies look at the proposed section 40, there is no great discretion for the Minister not to give the increase.  It sets out that there shall be a review of the consumer price index in a process that is proper to lay out in law.  At the end of subsection (2) one can see that the referable amounts accrued under the scheme shall be increased to reflect any such increase.  Subsection (3)(b) states that, subject to subsection (4), pensions payable under the scheme shall be increased to reflect any such increase - that is, an increase in the CPI.  The clause in subsection (4) that has caused concern is simply to lay a timing mechanism to do that.  I understand the logic of Deputy McDonald's amendment which takes away all the structure I have laid out and simply provides that pensions payable under the scheme shall be indexed in line with the CPI.  However, it does not mention any mechanism by which that is to be done, or when.  Is it weekly or monthly?  Nor does it provide, as the section does, that it can only be increased.  If they are to reflect movements in the CPI and be indexed in line with the CPI, they can be reduced as well.  I know that is not the Deputy's intention but that would be the effect of accepting her amendment.  Her amendment simply states that pensions under the scheme shall be indexed in line with the CPI, up or down.  That is not something I can accept.  I have set out a mechanism whereby this can be done.  There is no intention to avoid the increases.  It is a one-way valve so there cannot be decreases, even if the CPI goes down as has been the case in recent years on occasion.  It also sets out a clear mechanism about how it is to be done.  I am advised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that is the appropriate thing to do in primary legislation.As regards the more substantive point made by Deputy Fleming, he is right to say that this section is different from others in that the generality of the Bill affects future pensioners - in other words, people who have yet to be recruited to the public service.  They will, therefore, be recruited on terms that are known to them.  They can apply for jobs knowing their pay, conditions and pension entitlements.  It is not my intention to retrospectively alter existing pensions in this legislation, save in terms of how future additionality is to be determined.  It is a fundamental difference and I have explained this, to Deputy McDonald in particular, until I am blue in the face.  She talks about how it is possible to retrospectively impact upon existing pensioners in this section, but it is not possible to do so for pensioners that she wants to cut because of legal advice.  I am not cutting pensions in this legislation.  I am simply proposing for a Minister in the future to determine, if he or she so wishes, a different mechanism for increasing them.  Instead of it being linked to the current officeholder that filled the boots of the pensioner, I am saying that a future Minister can link that basis of increase to the increase in the CPI.In all my discussions with those in the private sector they regard these provisions as extraordinarily good, and most people would.  One gets a pension at the end of one's working life and it is preserved by being index-linked to inflation.  Therefore a person's standard of living is preserved into the future, which is not something that many in the private sector enjoy.  It is a reasonable provision.Should I or any future Minister seek to apply the CPI mechanism for increases to existing pension holders, that would have to be done by order of the House.  It would require the laying of a statutory instrument before the House and a positive vote of the House.  I am sure that newer Deputies are by now well familiar with the process.  There are two types of statutory instrument.  One cannot become effective unless an annulling motion is passed within a set timeframe.  The other type, of which there are fewer in number, requires a positive vote of the House to take effect.  This one fits into the latter category.  If I or any future Minister determined that the CPI process should apply to pensioners, it would have to be determined by the Dáil, and then be approved by the Seanad before it would have effect.  These are important matters.The effect of Deputy McDonald's amendment is simply to say that pensions should be indexed and I have dealt with that point.  If I have not dealt with any other points that were raised I will happily come back again to do so.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I do not intend to delay the proceedings of the House but there was an issue that arose on Committee Stage in the context of these amendments.  I was not part of that committee but it seems to me that the Minister has not properly addressed the issue of uniformed officers.  I read the Committee Stage debate with interest but I believe there is still room for further clarification.  I have a problem with an extraordinary situation whereby prison officers from my constituency, and all uniformed officers, appear to come out of this worse than other grades.  How can that be?Recently, a submission was made to the Minister's Department on the matter.  While it cannot be dealt with today, I would hope that the Minister will examine the issue in the course of the Seanad debate.  It is an issue that was addressed on Committee Stage but it has not been clarified in the interests of parity and fair play.  Why should uniformed officers be at a loss regarding the new pension regime changes?  It is neither fair nor equitable and it should be examined before this Bill is finally completed in the Oireachtas.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I have a question for the Minister on the upward only linking to CPI.  We are legislating now for public expenditure in respect of 65 to 70 years into the future.  It is entirely possible that 40, 50, 60 or 70 years into the future there could be a year-on-year CPI increase of 10% followed by a year-on-year CPI decrease of 10%.  We have no idea what price fluctuations will occur in Ireland 70 years from now.  If, for example, we had to deal with a high inflation rate for a few years, amounting to 50% over five years, and then experienced a 50% reduction over five years, then under this Bill as drafted the State would be faced with a 50% increase in pension payments which would reflect a real 50% purchasing power increase for pensioners.  Is it wise to allow the CPI only track upwards?  When one looks back over the past 100 years one notes times when CPI increased quickly and similarly reduced quickly.  This could be dangerous, although none of us may be around to deal with the ensuing headache.  Perhaps the Minister will consider taking another look at this provision.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Deputy Flanagan raised a point that is not pertinent to this particular section.  We discussed this issue in some detail on Committee Stage.  I am not sure what point the Deputy feels was not clarified.  I have previously made clear that I value uniformed personnel, in particular, members of the Garda Síochána and prison officers.  That is the reason they have unique preserved pensions which they receive at an age earlier than that at which anyone else receives theirs.  While the pension age for everyone else is being pushed out, we are not changing the pension age of those categories, which is extraordinarily advantageous in recognition of the important work they do.  They have fast accrual of pension, retire early and receive their pensions immediately on retirement although I accept they make a larger contribution.  That is the case in respect of everyone who has a fast accrual pension be it a judge, a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas or a member of a uniformed body.  Anyone in receipt of fast track accrual is, in fairness, required to make a larger contribution.  However, if one looks at the value of the pension they receive, actuarially as we live longer, some people will be retiring at 50 and others at 55 years while receiving a pension for 30 or 40 years beyond that.  Actuarially, it is an extraordinarily generous provision for the State to make, although one I think appropriate.On Deputy Donnelly's point in regard to the upward only link to CPI, the objective in this regard is maintenance of the value of a pension in so far as is reasonable and proper.  It is not my intention to bring this provision into effect in the foreseeable future.  However, the generality of pensions of those people who qualify under this single pension scheme in 40 years time will track the CPI.  If in 40 years time - I do not think this will be a cause of concern for any of us although please God we will all be here - a series of events results in a deflation for successive years of the scale spoken of by Deputy Donnelly, then obviously amending legislation will be introduced at that stage to deal with it.  It is highly unlikely that this legislation will remain unamended for the next half century.  People will have regard to changed circumstances then.I can reassure those people who will be recruited into the public service into the future that their pension and purchasing power should, by and large, be preserved by this provision.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The Minister appears to be suggesting that this is favourable from the point of view of future pensioners in that any changes to future entitlements will be upward only.  He has stated also that there is nothing about this change about which we should be concerned.  However, section 4 - this point has already been made so I will try not to labour it - provides that the Minister shall decide when an increase in pensions under this section is to be paid having regard to movements in the consumer price index, including the timing and means by which any increase is paid.  This gives the Minister and any future Minister total flexibility in that he or she could chose not to pay because of particular circumstances which he or she believes justifies delaying payment.  It certainly creates the potential for a lag behind the increases in inflation or those which would derive if the current scheme was retained, under which there is no automatic link between salary and pension increases.  This provision provides for an opt-out by the Minister.  I accept that might not be the Minister's intention.  However, in my view the Bill as drafted gives the Minister enormous flexibility.The Minister may say that the Government has no intention of degrading the pensions of existing public servants.  I am sure the Government wishes to avoid any confrontation with the public service unions and that that is the reason these changes apply to new entrants only.  However, under the section which gives the Minister the power by order to extend the application of this new regime, under which pension increases will be linked to CPI rather than salary increases, the Minister or a future Minister could apply this change to current public servants.  This could happen given the fairly extraordinary times in which we are living, where dramatic fluctuations are occurring in the economic and financial environment.  Once the Minister has the power to apply this new mechanism of calculating pension entitlements and increases, he or any future Minister could impose that on existing public servants.  The Minister knows that he or a future Minister could do that.  It is a serious prospect.  For that reason, I oppose this measure and believe workers and trade unions should be well aware that this threat exists.Given the pressure which I suspect the Minister will come under from the troika to meet targets over the coming years and the strong likelihood of the economic situation deteriorating further, the possibility of the provisions of this Bill being used to attack and degrade the pension entitlements of existing public servants is very real.

In page 49, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:"(4) The Minister shall publish a report on the implications of introducing a maximum clawback period of four years under this section within six months of the enactment of this Act.".Section 45 relates to repayment of overpayments of benefit.  One understands why this provision would exist and agrees with the principle that if at any time a person receives retirement benefit to which he or she is not entitled, arrangements need to be made for it to be recouped and repaid.  There is a clear logic to what I am suggesting here.  All I am asking is how a person could do that.  The most obvious thing would be an administrative error.  On the other side of the house, when we deal with taxation, there is a four-year clawback - the Revenue does not go back more than four years unless it suspects fraud and it can do so in very extreme circumstances.  I am suggesting having the same provision here such that the Revenue does not go back more than four years or that the citizen cannot go back more than four years unless there is a suspicion of fraud.  It is a bit severe to make provision to go after a person's estate after death as the person might not have been aware that he or she was being overpaid given that it might only come to light some years later.  If the Department has made an administrative error for more than four years at some point, it needs to carry the can.  I am asking for the same look-back provisions as apply to Revenue.

The Bill makes provision for a review and we can review it at that stage.  I understand the point, but the solution the Deputy is proffering to deal with the point of having a report published on the implications of the clawback within six months of enactment is not appropriate.  We will not be any wiser about the implications after six months because we will not know what the implications are.  We can think into the future of how we might review things.  In any event, there will be a review of the legislation but it is not practical to ask me to publish a report on the implications of the clawback period within six months when we will not be any wiser six months after enactment.

This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section to provide that where a scheme member, which means an existing or future public servant, is dismissed or resigns as a consequence of having lost the confidence of the Government, which would be an extreme and important case, he or she shall not benefit from the pension scheme in respect of the position so held.  Some very high profile people, whom I will not name, have exited the public service, and if they had a conscience they would accept that they resigned under a cloud for not having done the job they were paid handsomely to do.  There should be a sanction in the Bill that would apply to people who drew salaries for a long number of years and were paid to do a job, but patently did not do it.   This is not a broad issue.  I have narrowed the amendment to apply to a couple of people who resign as a consequence of having lost the confidence of the Government or are dismissed for this reason.  If a person has been a public servant for 30 years, he or she will have built up pension entitlements.  If, in the final years of a career, such a person lost the confidence of the Government in his or her ability to do the job, there should be a provision to deal with the work they were doing at the time of retirement or dismissal.  The 30 years of good service prior to taking up the final post must be taken into account for pension purposes and this pension cannot be touched.  For example, nobody had confidence in the ability of the Financial Regulator to do his job-----

Such issues aggravate the public.  Such individuals retire with large lump sum payments and massive pensions.  Most people are of the view that they have not earned these pensions.

I ask the Minister to state his views on that matter.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	436	This matter was discussed in general terms on Committee Stage.  The Deputy has raised a very important point.  In the formulation of his amendment the Deputy is putting forward a concept rather than a legal framework.  The idea of losing the confidence of the Government being the determination of losing one's pension would be a very risky position.  For instance, one adviser who is working for the Government says he loses the confidence of the Government twice a week but I am sure he gets it back again twice as quickly.A loss to be imposed on people who acted improperly is not a matter to be dealt with in pension law.  What is intended by the section is whether, in a case where a person has defrauded money, this could be recouped from his or her pension.  I am advised by the Attorney General this is a practical and possible way to address the issue.  The imposition of the loss of a pension on a person for a nebulous reason such as stated, for losing the confidence of the Government, has a number of fault lines.  The first is that it would politicise the process.  There were Governments and Ministers in the past who might easily have lost confidence in people because they were very authoritarian in their views.  That is not the way a public service should be constructed.  While I understand what the Deputy intends, this is not the way to do it.I took the advice of the Attorney General because this is an important issue and to see if it could be addressed in any way.  She pointed out a number of difficulties in dealing with it as suggested by the Deputy.  It would impose a penalty which would trespass on the rights of the courts who alone can impose a significant penalty.I refer to case law which is relevant to this matter.  The 1997 Lovett case reflects this point.  It related to a teacher whose retirement on grounds of ill-health was precipitated by the discovery of serious financial irregularities.  The teacher's superannuation scheme contained a forfeiture provision relating to misconduct and because there was demonstrable misconduct, it was decided that a forfeiture of pension would be an appropriate sanction.  That matter was tested in the courts where it was determined that such an administrative action was not enforceable.  A recoupment of an overpayment of wages or pension or of a debt is recoverable, but a sanction would not be constitutional.For those reasons, while I understand the motivation of the Deputy's amendment and I am sympathetic to it, I cannot accept it.  I do not blame the Deputy but is it clear it is not crafted in a manner that is enforceable and in general terms there are constitutional difficulties in trying to establish significant administrative sanctions which would be outside the normal role of the courts and their reserved role under the Constitution to determine wrongdoing and to impose sanctions.

I was trying to frame an amendment that would not be ruled out of order and so it was drafted in a particular way.  I wanted to use the amendment to raise the point and it had to be quite narrow in its specification.  This is a matter that should be considered because there has been anger about some people who drove off with big lump sums and settlements and big pensions.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I appreciate the Minister's comprehensive reply.  The loss of Government confidence is a very elastic concept.  For very good reasons one could lose the confidence of a Government.  The legislation allows for a sanction of sorts and the Minister has set out the reasons.  This is in cases where there has been a financial cost to the scheme or to the State.  I suspect Deputy Fleming's motivation for this amendment is in cases where people in senior positions were asleep at the wheel and they made a Horlicks of the duties they were supposed to carry out.  For instance, senior civil servants were moved out of the Department of Finance to an EU post.  This, understandably, causes anxiety.  I am not sure one can cater for such a situation in pension legislation but there is something to be said for having administrative remedies where it is clear that people have failed in their duty, not just where a financial cost is incurred but also where there have been serious cases of maladministration.  The Minister might give some attention to this matter in the future.

We should not prejudge these matters, and I advise the House to be very careful about this matter.  For the reasons I have stated, I cannot accept the amendment.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is a short but important Bill to enable the electoral register to be used for selecting citizen members of the constitutional convention.  When consideration was being given to the establishment of the constitutional convention, the Government decided there should be 100 members, of which 66 would be ordinary citizens.  As set out in the resolution made in this House yesterday, membership of the convention will consist of "66 citizens entitled to vote at a referendum, randomly selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society".Section 13A of the Electoral Act 1992, inserted by section 4 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, provides that it is an offence to use information in the register other than for electoral or other statutory purposes.  Such a statutory purpose is provided for example in the Juries Act for the selection of members of juries.There is in place an edited register which may be used for any purpose.  That register includes about 300,000 voters who have opted to have their names included on it.  That is a relatively small percentage of the total electorate, which stood at 3.144 million for the referendum in May.  Clearly, therefore, the edited register would not be adequate for our purpose.The constitutional convention is not established by statute and it is necessary, therefore, to provide in the Electoral Acts for the use of information in the register in the selection of citizen members of the convention.  As the Taoiseach has informed the House, a polling company will be engaged to select 66 people on the electoral register who are representative of the population generally in terms of gender, age, social class and region.  The selection process will be overseen by the independent chairperson of the convention.Section 1 of the Bill amends Section 13A of the Electoral Act 1992 by inserting a new subsection.  This will provide that information in the electoral register may be used for the purpose of selecting citizens of Ireland to participate in the convention.  Section 2 of the Bill contains standard provisions dealing with the Title, citation and construction of the Bill.The sole purpose of this Bill is to provide in statute for the use of the electoral register in the selection of citizen members of the convention.  It is a Bill to facilitate an important operational aspect of setting up the convention.  I commend it to the House.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	445	We support the Bill.  It is a good idea and will be of value to the process.  However, the matters that the convention will be given to consider are of equal importance.  Given the discussions inside and outside the House and at the Committee of Public Accounts and in light of the Government's consideration of a banking inquiry, it is appropriate to say that the convention's work will be important.  It should consider the administration of the country and the workings of this House as priorities.In compiling the report on a banking inquiry, the Committee of Public Accounts was conscious of the significant legal difficulties facing any Dáil inquiry.  The referendum was informative in this regard and suggested that sufficient information was not put before the electorate.  Greater in-depth consideration is necessary ahead of similar referendums.  The convention will help in this regard.  The inclusion of citizens in the convention is a welcome example of the involvement of people in the democratic process.A banking inquiry is essential.  It must have a broader base than that discussed this morning, namely, to fill an information gap.  It is important that we protect the integrity of the Committee of Public Accounts, its members and the work it has done since its foundation, in particular its investigations into DIRT, the Arms Trial, spending and so on.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, in particular decided to focus on the committee's Chairman and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The committee has a record of conducting excellent inquiries and has always been chaired by Opposition parties.  The Minister should focus on the task in hand rather than the personalities involved.  In terms of the convention and the work of the Government, broadening the committee's powers and shoring up its work are necessary.  Dumbing it down in any way is unacceptable, yet that appears to be under way.  Nor are the Minister's comments acceptable.  The first task of any convention should be to consider the committee's powers, its standing within the House, its reputation and the respect in which it is held by the public.  A debate on this subject and any referendum that might be required to enhance the committee's powers should be held sooner rather than later.As we head into discussions on a banking inquiry, the Government will find it necessary to introduce legislation regardless of who conducts the inquiry.  Needless to say, the all-party Committee of Public Accounts believes that examining the €64 billion of taxpayers' money spent by the Government on the banks is a natural progression of its work.  Some of the paperwork now available shows that ten days prior to the night of the bank guarantee, the banks were talking up their positions and the economy.  They were bust ten days later.  It is critical that the truth be told and examined by those who were central to the decision, be they politicians, bankers or civil servants.  We have been told that little paperwork from the time of the decision exists.  Therefore, we need to hear directly from the people involved.  If this necessitates providing the committee with the power of compellability or making Cabinet papers available, which has been suggested in the report, it should be done sooner rather than later.  We need to hear from those who were involved during the night of the guarantee.  The Taoiseach's suggestion that the inquiry would be limited to this is not good enough.  The inquiry should have a much broader base.The Committee of Public Accounts has set out a roadmap by which this can be achieved and has been supported by a senior counsel's opinion.  Learning from what we described as the first pillar of the inquiry, we should move on to events in the banks.  For example, what were the internal audit committees doing and how were the economists describing and forecasting the economy to the banks?  We need to examine what the auditors were doing and what their audits told them.  These aspects are essential to any inquiry.Informed by pillar 1 and having dealt with the banks, the committee could move on to pillar 3.  As suggested in the report, we could consider the regulatory system, the Department of Finance, various other agencies and anyone who was involved.  Even if they are now retired, they could be brought back to explain what occurred.  It is my belief and that of the Committee of Public Accounts that, unless we pursue this type of inquiry and have appropriate powers provided to us through legislation, we will not get to the truth of the matter.  The public would like to see that truth being told in a way that states the case clearly in terms of how the decisions were taken, the Merrill Lynch opinion and what other opinions were available, including what outside sources advised the former Government.Any convention needs to be informed about the background to these issues so that it can reach an appropriate conclusion.  This is essential to the democratic process and the workings of the House.  While the Bill is short and will be handled quickly, the all-party Committee of Public Accounts has called for a full Dáil debate on the report.  This is essential in moving the situation forward.Although it may be a separate issue, I urge the Government via the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to consider the report before making further comment on it.  The relevance and importance of the Committee of Public Accounts should not be diminished in any way.  If anything, they should be enhanced.  Any effort to reduce its powers, the scope of its inquiries or its position within the House should be resisted by the Government and Members of this Parliament.

We are committed to working towards an entirely new constitution as the cornerstone of a new republic.  If approached in the right way, the constitutional reform project could inspire people, revive their hopes for a positive future and become a catalyst for change and national unity.We welcome the Government's proposal on establishing a constitutional convention that would undertake "comprehensive constitutional reform".  Like some other promises, however, the proposal has fallen far short.  The Bill is a blunt tool for engagement and will restrict the ability to consult the Irish people.  The consultation process will only be focused on one small part of a bigger picture.The Government's proposal outlines the issues for consideration by the convention.  These include giving citizens living overseas the right to vote at Irish embassies in presidential elections, the provision for same-sex marriages and reducing the voting age to 17 years.We welcome that, but perhaps the Minister could clarify what would happen to Irish citizens in the North, where there is no embassy.  We are not proposing that we establish an embassy in the North.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	449	We can make arrangements for that on Sevastopol Street or somewhere like that.  Perhaps the Minister might outline his thoughts on the issue.By restricting the consultation process to those on the voter register, the Government cannot achieve a true reflection of opinion on these issues.  By its nature, the voter register excludes those in the Six Counties, the Irish diaspora and those under 18.  It does not allow us to identify people in some communities, such as the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.In our submission we outlined how this aspect of consultation should take place.  We indicated that "the Central Statistics Office should be charged with responsibility for random citizen selection within the demographic categories, as it has the public trust in the gathering of demographic data on behalf of the Irish people".  It is not an appropriate task for private polling companies, as the Minister mentioned.  The electoral register is not a sufficient tool as it will automatically exclude young people from participation.  It is ironic that there was a suggestion that they be included but the process seems to exclude that cohort.  The electoral register will not adequately represent people living in marginalised communities, many of whom are not on the register.Sinn Féin believes the constitutional convention should be fully inclusive in composition and use a participatory process, actively involving the economically disadvantaged, the socially marginalised, citizens from all 32 counties of Ireland, Unionists and their official representatives, citizens in the diaspora and our newest citizens.  That is in addition to the political parties, civil society representatives and those with relevant academic and legal expertise.  We must also ensure equal representation of women on the convention, which should hold its hearings throughout the island to get a geographical spread of views.  This would have provided the basis for a real conversation about the future of Ireland and its people.The convention must consider the broadest possible scope of matters, including guarantees of economic and social rights, the extension of voting rights for northern citizens and citizens in the diaspora and the architecture necessary to establish a more robustly inclusive, fully representative and accountable democracy with mechanisms for direct participation.  Sinn Féin wants to see a rights-based society.  The new constitution arising from a process of consultation must include maximum human rights guarantees, and it must contain all the modern equality and human rights protections that meet our international obligations.  Sinn Féin wants to see a constitution that is seen as a benchmark for the international community.  The new constitution arising from this process should not only be exemplary, but also be durable, justifying the investment of resources, time and effort that will go into it.  To do this, the process must be realistically framed and not rushed by an inappropriate deadline of 12 months.  This will only lead to accusations that the process is rushed and tokenistic.  Judging by what is on offer tonight, that accusation may prove correct.Sinn Féin supports bringing proposals for a refreshed constitution before the people in a referendum in 2016.  That would truly be an honourable way of marking the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  We can generally agree that the topics listed in the Government's position paper should be considered by the convention but we do not agree that "other matters" are simply an afterthought.  We believe in comprehensive reform of our political institutions at all levels, including the Oireachtas, local government, regional government and all-Ireland co-operation and governance mechanisms, including an all-Ireland council of Ministers, the all-Ireland parliamentary forum and the all-Ireland consultative civic forum.  There should also be electoral reform in its widest sense and the introduction of mechanisms for participatory democracy at all levels of governance so that resulting constitutional provisions or amendments will be coherent and holistic.We fully agree that fundamental Seanad reform is necessary but we do not agree that Seanad reform should be outside the scope of consideration by the convention.  The public should not be asked to vote on Seanad reform separately.  To reduce Seanad reform to a question of whether to abolish it is too simple.  Large numbers of people see the need for a second House and a second tier in our democracy.  Asking the people if they are for or against the abolition does not leave room for discussion about reform, so the Government is going at the problem the wrong way.The cost of running the Seanad must be reduced and as it stands, it cannot be defended.  I would not try to do so and most Members would not even try to do so.  Nevertheless, the issue cannot be boiled down to a simple "Yes"or ""No" question on retaining the House.  The constitutional convention provides an opportunity for us to debate the matter, and some of the members of the Minister's party would agree with me on it.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this new Bill, the Electoral (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012, which deals with selecting citizen members of the constitutional convention.  At first I was excited about any proposal that would bring real change and reform to politics in Ireland.  Sadly, on considering the details, it appears to lack real teeth and seems to be running away from many serious issues.  For this to be meaningful and a success, we need the participation of all citizens around the country, and not just from a small selection of society.It is important to highlight that the constitutional convention is a significant and worthy endeavour which, if thoughtfully executed, would provide an opportunity to address those areas of the Irish Constitution which have, over the past 75 years, been identified as in need for fine-tuning.  A delicate balance must be struck between the meaningful reform of the weaker elements of Bunreacht na hÉireann and the protection of those portions of the Constitution that have provided a solid foundation for the realisation of the democratic, free and sovereign State that is the Republic of Ireland.Any constitutional convention established must in its structures respect the essential balance between the imperative to reform and evolve in the document, provide the opportunity for the people to have direct input to such reform and recognise the areas in which the true strengths of Bunreacht na hÉireann lie.  At the time of its drafting, enactment and implementation, this cornerstone of the Irish legal system was a revolutionary document that aspired to the development of a society based on the principles of social justice, equality and freedom.  This was at a time when the dominant regimes of Europe were evolving into ever more oppressive states whose systematic curtailment of civil liberties and disregard for democratic principles ultimately led to the outbreak of the Second World War.As imperfect as many elements are, Bunreacht na hÉireann embodies the spirit of independence and courageous, meaningful change, which must be honoured in any attempt to fundamentally reform it.  One cannot throw out the baby with the bath water.  Any proposed convention, if lacking ambition in its objectives and nuance in its approach to addressing the weaker elements of the Constitution, runs the grave risk of joining all previous constitutional reform committees and bodies in seeing its reports lie idle on the shelves of the State's libraries while once again reform takes a back seat to more politically desirable issues.  These are important statements to make on the convention.It is hugely disappointing that the remit of the convention is to be limited to the topics set out in the programme for Government.  While this disappointment is not to be misconstrued as disagreement with the need to reform the areas for review set out by the Government in its proposals, the piecemeal and compartmentalised approach to be taken to the areas the convention will be mandated to explore indicates that the recommendations made are likely to be incomplete and ineffective due to the limited scope of the convention.  When one looks at the detail of the remit of the convention, it deals with a review of Dáil electoral strategy, reducing the Presidential term to five years in line with local and European elections, giving citizens the right to vote in Presidential elections at Irish embassies, increasing the participation of women in politics and reducing the voting age to 17.  The Dáil, Seanad, Presidential and local electoral systems do not exist in a political vacuum but rather comprise the unit under which occurs the democratic engagement between the people of Ireland and the local administration system and the Executive and Legislature organs of the State.I agree with my colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley, with regard to the North.  We must have a debate about the division of the country and a reasonable and calm debate about the conflict on the island.  We must also have a reasonable debate on why the country is divided and why there is no need for it to be divided.  We need to start to bring our people together.  This is very important, which is why I am disappointed that Northern voters are constantly excluded from democratic positions on the island.  If one speaks about a democratic republic, we must respect all traditions, Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.I strongly believe the Seanad must be reformed but I am against its abolition.  We can reform it and make it more democratic, but I like the idea of having a second Chamber with regard to democratic politics in the country.  I accept the point about cost but with flexibility, vision, courage and the powerful energy of reform, we can do this and serve our country well.Amending the clause on the role of women in the home and encouraging greater participation of women in public life needs to be examined very closely.  The reference to blasphemy in the Constitution should be removed.  The proposals to amend the provisions on blasphemy and the role of women in the home in the interests of encouraging greater participation of women in public life, while seemingly separate, in fact highlight the very weakness of the compartmentalised vision for change presented in the Government's proposals for the convention.  The sheer unsuitability of such provisions and their inconsistency with the manner in which Irish society has developed and arguably existed until the 1930s, considering the significant contribution made by women to the revolutionary movements through which the State was born, derives specifically from the very narrow temporary religiously-focused nature of their content.  I wish for this to be debated in very clear terms.I strongly support those who advocate the need for a strong, participative convention.  The Government should foster national ownership from the outset by establishing it through an open, participative, inclusive and transparent process, and it is very important to include these words.  Of course resources must be made available to facilitate widespread and meaningful consultation.  We must also deal with education and participation by members of the public, civil society and other interested stakeholders.  We also need an open and transparent appointments process to ensure membership of the convention is balanced, representative and facilitates meaningful input by civil society organisations and those on the margins of society.  I emphasise the need for those who are excluded to be included.  An inclusive convention is something to which we should look forward.A range of civic education measures should be undertaken to inform members of the public about the role, scope and potential outcome of the constitutional convention.  We must also work closely with local and national media.  Facilitating meaningful input by civil society organisations through this process must be a priority for the convention and we must examine this.  We need a meaningful constitutional convention.Knowledge and experience would benefit the convention in its deliberations and should be drawn from as wide a pool of experts as possible, including legal, political and community sectors.  I come from the community sector.  I do not want the convention to be taken over by academics and I warn against this.  They have a contribution to make but I want to know what our citizens want and I want to ensure they are part of the movement for change in the country.The list of topics presented by the Government should be expanded.  The opportunity afforded by the convention to explore other potential issues for reform with regard to the Constitution should not be lost, including issues of electoral reform, equality, the family, economic, social and cultural rights and Irish unity.  Members of the public should be provided with an opportunity to consider the recommendations of the convention and provide feedback.I welcome the overall debate on this issue.  There is a need for dramatic changes, but I wish to ensure the convention is as inclusive as possible.  For me, the jury is out with regard to the involvement of politicians.  I would love a people's convention to see what they feel, without the 33 politicians who will be directly involved.  However, I do not like to exclude people, particularly people who represent the Unionist and Nationalist traditions in the North and I believe they will have two delegates.  We must ensure the constitutional convention is participative, inclusive and meaningful.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	459	The Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Bill before us intends to allow citizens to be chosen from the electoral register to participate in the proposed constitutional convention.  To my mind it will not have the capability to reflect society as a whole with only 66 people, and even with 200 people it would be difficult for it to do so.  There is a democratic deficit within the convention.  It is broken down by age and region, but it does not have the capability to reflect society as a whole.  Therefore, it is fundamentally flawed.The convention's remit is not broad enough and I believe it is a sham.  The decision to act upon recommendations arising from discussions or consultations will be in the hands of the Government.  The convention will not make any decisions, so its outcome will be determined by the Government and not by the citizens who will participate in it.  Therefore, the process of including citizens is inconsequential.  The remit of the convention has been decided by the Government and is very restrictive, including only civil and political issues.  The concept of looking through the register is good but it does not go far enough and it cannot do what is necessary, which was Deputy Finian McGrath's point on the necessity of a people's convention.I fully support the right to same-sex marriage, full equality for women, removing blasphemy from the Constitution and the reduction in the voting age, all issues which are to be discussed by the proposed convention.  I favour the abolition of the Presidency and of the Seanad, which are both toothless, expensive, ceremonial institutions intended only to conceal the centralisation of power in the hands of the Government.Equally important rights, more so in a time of economic crisis, are the rights to work, to equal pay for work of equal value, to a minimum standard of living, to universal access to health care and housing, to universal access to education, including educational services appropriate to needs, particularly for the 650 students with disability who want to return to education next year with access to SNAs, and the right of autistic children to services appropriate to their needs.  These are rights many people would prefer to debate if they got the opportunity and were selected from the electoral register.  Another issue that should be taken up by the convention is the issue of the separation of church and State.  This issue has not been discussed and should be raised.These socio-economic issues affect many people and public representatives try to help citizens with them on a daily basis, but they are not up for discussion at all by the convention.  In my opinion, these issues are excluded from the discussion because the Government is implementing policies that deny many citizens such socio-economic rights, in particular, those on average and low incomes, because it does not want discussions that would expose or challenge the policies being pursued by the Government.There is no proposal for the consideration of human rights by the convention or for the composition of the convention to reflect human rights provisions which might be incorporated into the Constitution.  The failure to include these is occurring despite the fact that previous constitutional reviews, most recently in 1996, identified Articles 40 and 44 of the Constitution as being flawed with regard to current international standards on human rights.  Groups that have played a key role in fighting for those rights are not being included in the convention.Citizens selected to take part in the convention are invited to participate at weekends, rather than being facilitated to participate during working time, as is the norm with jury service.  They are being asked to give up their time, under the guidance of experts selected by the Government, to participate in a process where the outcome will be decided by the Government.  The process also excludes issues which many civil society groups say should be included in any consideration of constitutional reform.I will vote against this Bill for the reasons I have stated and because both the remit of the proposed constitutional convention and any amendments to reform the Constitution will be decided by the Government.  I do not believe the amendment proposed in this Bill will facilitate the broader issues that need to be discussed by society.

The Bill enables people to be selected from the electoral register to take part in the convention.I have many concerns with regard to the proposed convention and see it as merely window dressing to try to fulfil some of the promises made in the programme for Government or during the election.  The Government has failed miserably to deliver on any of its promises, but it seems it is taking this proposal as the easy option and is rushing the Bill through the House in order to set up the convention.  However, the Government remains in charge and will select 66 people to take part.  I am one of the members of the Technical Group who volunteered to take part in the convention, but I strenuously object to the fact that it is being convened in Dublin, that it will be convened at weekends and that it will be guided by a so-called expert group selected by the Government.  That to me implies it will be guided by either paid special advisers or civil servants.We have got to a pretty sad state in this country and this convention is just more of the same.  The Government wants to retain a grip on everything and to hold onto everything it has and it is just tokenism to propose selecting 66 people from the electoral register.  How are these people to be picked?  In my county recently a deceased 99 year old woman was called for jury duty.  How will such incidents be avoided?  We have been told a polling company will make the selection, but the work of some such companies is quite shoddy.  I have never employed any of them, but I have not been impressed by any I ever had any contact with.  I do not wish to be ageist, but how can people over a certain age be selected from the register for jury duty?  When a complaint was made regarding the selection of the deceased woman, the person making the complaint had the head eaten off her by an official.  She got on to me about it and when I inquired about it, I got the head eaten off me by a very hostile public official.  I had to get her supervisor to come back and apologise to me for her behaviour.  In fairness, the supervisor addressed my issues and also telephoned the family of the dead woman and apologised.  I understand these things can happen through human error, but how will we avoid such things happening in selecting people for the convention if the electoral register is to be used to select them?   Some of the 66 people selected may have emigrated or be deceased..  We need to be careful about how this is done.This is a simple Bill in comparison to some of the Bills and outrageous suggestions made by the Minister since he came into government.  The Minister has become known as Phil the enforcer, but following this Bill he may be known as Phil the enabler.  However, the Bill does not really enable anybody to do anything.  The convention should not be held in Dublin.  I am not anti Dublin, but the convention should move around the country to facilitate people from other parts of the country.  Not everything happens in Dublin and finishes at Newlands Cross.  What is wrong with this country is that people running the Government think everything finishes at Newlands Cross and that rural people do not matter.  The same occurred with regard to wastewater, with the Minister vindictively penalising rural people.  The fact is that most pollution is caused by urban areas and cities.  I look forward to that decision being challenged in the courts, because it is wrong.  It is time we shouted "Stop" and gave ordinary people their rights and listened to them.I hope that despite its shortcomings there will be strong participation in the convention from the 66 citizen members.  The rest will comprise politicians and representatives, both from the North and South.  However, the convention will not be representative of the whole country if there are only 66 citizens on it.  These should be people who want to participate honestly and openly and be without a hidden agenda.  Like others, I do not want to see too many academics on this convention nor to see it being hived off to them.  My concern is that the same will happen here as happens with other Bills, the Gaeltacht Bill being a case in point.  That Bill, which is being discussed this week, does away with democracy.  It is abolishing the elections for Údarás na Gaeltacht and instead we will have seven members appointed by the Government to the údarás and five members appointed by county councils and Gaeltacht areas.  These councils have strong government majorities, so we will end up with 12 government members on the board of the údarás.  I do not think that is fair or transparent.I understand that Seanad reform is not included in the remit of the convention.  Reform of the Seanad is the Taoiseach's pet project and he wants to keep that for himself.  I do not understand why it could not be included in the remit of the convention, because it should be discussed and we should get the people's views.  I know there is open warfare going on within the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and, indeed, all parties in this regard.  I am not in favour of abolishing the Seanad, but I am in favour of reform.  Abolishing the Seanad is just another grandiose idea and I do not believe it will ever happen.  If the Taoiseach is interested in reforming the Seanad, the issue should be put before the convention for discussion.It will be able to discuss the voting age and many other issues but not real reform of the electoral system, and the Seanad and the Government will have the final say.  I want a proper discussion on civil and political issues.  It will depend on the members but I do not want the neo-liberals to take it over and get us everything from same-sex marriage, to which I am fundamentally opposed, to God knows what.We must also discuss social and economic policies and the policies the Government is implementing.  As I informed the troika last week, it was elected on a particular mandate but it has done the exact opposite.  It was going to burn the bondholders and God knows what else but it has introduced austerity measure after austerity measure.  We have seen from different reports, including one from the Economic and Social Research Institute which was suppressed, that people do not have spending money.I hope there will be a fund available to the people involved in the convention and that they will get enough to cover their expenses when they have to travel to Dublin.  They will not have Michael Fingleton to give them big loans, which the Minister could get.  That is what is wrong with this country.  People in high places are getting away with so much.  The finger was pointed at Fianna Fáil and the last Government but now we see what is happening here.  The Minister for Health will make a statement tonight but no questions will be asked about a nursing home in my constituency.  These are the connections these people have despite transparency and openness and their promises, which is all waffle.  It is okay for us and the ordinary people but it is not good enough for the Minister, Deputy Hogan, or the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  They will do what they want and talk down to the people, dismiss them with arrogance, admonish them and say: "Peasants get lost and croppies lie down."  The old blue shirt regime is up and running.I look forward to the convention, meagre as it will be, and I will participate if I can.  If it is sham, I will call it one.  I will not participate in any sham to suit the Minister or this Government.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I would say to Deputy Mattie McGrath that he should repeat what he said in regard to my personal matters outside the House.This is an historic first to have the public involved in reviewing the Constitution.  It has happened in other jurisdictions but it has never happened here.  What we are doing here is facilitating that process.  I know it is only 66 people but, as Deputy Finian McGrath said, we do not want all of academia involved in this process, and he was right.  Ordinary people will have an opportunity to contribute.Members of the public will be selected at random.  They will be generally representative of society as regards age, gender, region and social class.  There will be 33 males and 33 females in the public membership.  Members will, in the first instance, be identified via an independent polling company using professional sampling techniques.  The electoral register will then be used to verify that they can vote in referendums and therefore confirm their membership of the convention.  I assure Deputy Mattie McGrath that only those people who are alive and answer the telephone or respond to the letter will be able to confirm their participation in the convention.  The procedure to select the public members will be overseen by the chair of the convention.I thank Deputies for their contributions and I hope the process by which we are getting the public involved will be seen as an historic first and that they will have an input into reviewing our Constitution, the document of which we are all proud.  Obviously, at this moment in time, the Government has decided it needs to be reviewed and it is engaging with the public in that process.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	462	My concerns about this Bill arise from my personal experience of dealing with people who incurred serious debt during the boom through sub-prime lending.  Like others in this House, I have spent a significant part of my life advising people on the way out of debt.  This Bill gives rise to certain problems in this regard and I hope the Minister will see fit to introduce amendments during the course of its passage through the House.Over the past four years a considerable number of people have struggled valiantly to meet their commitments, including in some cases guarantees for their children's mortgages.  These individuals are now in a very difficult position.  It is important that we recognise the efforts they have made.  Another group of people were advised to borrow heavily to purchase their houses.  I refer to those who borrowed to purchase their homes rather than for frivolous purposes.  They purchased property in an inflated market because they feared they would never get another opportunity to own a home of their own.  It is part of the psyche of the Irish people that we own our own houses.  A land war was fought in this country over home ownership and the right to own one's own place.  Many of these people were put in a position from which they cannot extricate themselves because of sub-prime lending and bad advice.  The killing factor in this situation is compound interest and penalties.  Penalties and compound interest should not be entertained while we attempt to resolve the problems that burden so many people in this country.I recognise that certain personalities, for want of a better word, got into difficulty because they decided to borrow many times the normal amount.  However, thousands of ordinary householders are attempting to make their repayments even though they are in receipt of nothing more than a social welfare payment of €198 per week.  They are in a terribly difficult position.  I would love to have time to speak about their plight in more detail because this is an issue which will stay with us for many years to come.  If we do this right, it will live with us, but if we do it wrong, it will follow us for the rest of our lives.  I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality to take account of the problems arising in respect of interest penalties.

Cé go bhfuilimid ag fanacht tamall fíor-fhada le haghaidh reachtaíocht ar an bhfadhb seo, atá ag cur isteach ar 100,000 duine faoi láthair, cuirim fáilte roimh go leor den mhéid atá sa Bhille atá foilsithe faoi dheireadh.  Caithfidh mé a rá, áfach, go bhfuil sé lochtach i dtaobh an fíor-fhadhb atá sa tír seo, a bhaineann leo siúd nach bhfuil ábalta socruithe a bhaint amach lena bainc.  De réir na reachtaíochta seo, beidh veto ag na bainc go fóill.  On entering office, the Government faced a number of challenges in terms of rectifying the problems that faced this State as a result of the destructive policies of Fianna Fáil and its partners in Government.  One of the problems that remains to be resolved by the Government is mortgage distress.  The other big issue that people must address is managing their personal lives while coping with the social welfare system, public services and the taxes they are required to pay.  The Government's first test on these big issues was in the budget.  It could have cast off the cloak of austerity that Fianna Fáil had worn but decided instead to wrap itself in the same austerity policies which had wrecked the economy.The budget hurt the economy and inflicted huge pain in the people who will be affected by this legislation.  Earlier today the CSO published the quarterly national accounts, which reveal that the contraction in GDP was 1.1% higher than last quarter.  That massive contraction is the first test of the Government's policy of changing direction by stimulating growth.  I do not remember how many times Members on the other side of the House have announced that their policies were about growth, growth and growth.  Today the CSO has shown that the Government failed miserably when it comes to devising budgetary policies which can change direction in how people spend, save and invest.  The answer will be given in detail tomorrow when the full quarterly national accounts are published.The Government's second test is dealing with the 100,000 families who are in mortgage distress.  Some of them have borrowed excessively but they were involved in a system which told them to get on the property ladder before it is too late.  I was a Senator when Donie Cassidy imparted his words of wisdom to the young people of Ireland by telling them to buy now.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of speaking in this urgent debate on health, including the overall management of our health service.  Despite all the talk from the Minister and the Government about budgets, targets, beds, mental health and services for people with disabilities, there are still major problems in the health service.  We have a huge problem in the disability sector, so I urge action and common sense in this debate.Up to 700 young adults with an intellectual and physical disability have left school this year but there will be no place for them in September due to the disastrous management of the health service.  It is a nightmare for these people and their families.  I am calling for immediate action on this priority issue.  The services that should be there for them were cut by 3.7% in January.  Some €750,000 was cut from one service alone on the north side of Dublin.  The same service now has 40 service users who are in crisis and need residential care.  This service has also been told that there will be no money for it come next September.This is what is happening to people with disability.  This is the real world for the most vulnerable sections of society.  Ministers should all hang their heads in shame over this issue.  People with disability did not cause this economic and banking crisis; they should never be forced to pay for the actions of greedy people.The Minister got his figures wrong concerning the €500 million overspend.  People are still on trolleys and wards are being closed, as are operating theatres.  Yet we see cynical attacks on staff who are doing an excellent job against the odds.  This is all due to a failure to plan the health budget and a lack of common sense in dealing with health issues.I urge all Deputies to support these issues in the health debate.  It is time to take tough decisions but money should be spent on our health service via a fair and equitable tax system.

From the outset of this budget, it was clear that there was no way a reasonable and efficient health service could be provided on the basis of the figures originally presented by the Minister.  I am disappointed but not surprised that the Minister for Health is not in the House to hear this debate.  He should be here.In particular, I support the final part of the motion which "rejects any moves to close wards, theatres or hospitals as a result of the failure to properly plan the health budget".  Two hospitals in County Tipperary have been affected by budget cuts.  Last week during the Topical Issue debate, I referred to South Tipperary General Hospital where trolleys have been on corridors for some time.  This is a progressive co-operative hospital and in his reply last week the Minister confirmed that it is working above and beyond the call of duty.  There has been an 11% increase in general activity levels with a 32% rise in the level of medical activity.  The average length of stay has been reduced to 3.5 days, which is less than the national average.  This is a very progressive hospital yet it is being punished by the Minister and through the method by which the HSE has made moneys available to it.Thurles Community Hospital has been rebuilt in recent years.  It had 72 beds but now has 50 following the closure of 22 beds.  The respite waiting list for that hospital is now at 400.  The committee supporting the hospital met the Minister back in January when he confirmed that he would reopen those 22 beds.  When will he do so?  There is major pressure on that hospital, which is doing excellent work.  The Minister has promised to reopen those beds but that has not happened.  I hope the Minister will respond and tell us exactly when he is going to reopen the 22 beds.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I wish to refer to the proposed 100-bed special unit in St. Vincent's Hospital which I raised as a Topical Issue last week and which has also been mentioned by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.  There is serious concern in an already beleaguered hospital system that the overspend will have an impact on the special unit which was supposed to open last month.  In February, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, announced that it would open in June.  There is no communication between St. Vincent's Hospital management, the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland or the CFAI, the consultants and hospital staff about when the unit will open.  How are they going to sign off on the protocol that was promised and agreed between the three groups some months ago?  This should be announced today.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Minister for Health would be here tonight to make a statement on the matter.  I am hoping that he will attend the House for this debate.  I can understand the pressure on him this evening concerning his own personal business, but he is the Minister for Health so he should be here to respond to the concerns of families and the CFAI about this matter.  It is scandalous that the building has been built and is waiting for patients to move in, while at the same time Cystic Fibrosis patients are waiting four or five days to access beds in St. Vincent's Hospital.The Minister may try to avoid the issue but the CFAI has contacted the Minister's office over the last week or two to try to get a response.  There seems to be some ducking and diving on the matter.  The families want a resolution now, as I do.  A family member of mine is a CF sufferer.  I want to hear when that 100-bed unit is going to open.  The Taoiseach promised that the Minister would attend the House tonight.There was a meeting earlier today of Fibromyalgia sufferers.  I would like the Minister to outline his position on this subject.  This medical condition is new on the agenda but is not recognised as a sickness or illness.  The matter has been in the Minister's hands for the last eight months but nothing has been done due to the beleaguered state of the health service.  I would like to know what is happening in this regard.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	470	We all appreciate that there are limited funds available but we need to get the best possible services from the existing funds.  At the end of the day the health service is about those who work in it and those who avail of the services provided.  The vast majority of people who contact me about the health service do so because they are in a crisis situation.  For example, people may be told that on medical grounds they will get a place in a nursing home, only to find later that they must wait until a place becomes available.  Basically they are waiting for somebody to die.  One may often see that the person caring for them is burnt out.  I have seen people with chronic illnesses getting hospital appointments that are so far in the future they might not be around to avail of them.  I have seen parents in a panic with young people making the transition from secondary school to adult services but such services will not be available for them this year.  All the money was spent getting children from primary to secondary school - particularly those with autism - yet they cannot transfer to adult services.  This means that all the money was wasted.The HSE is not fit for purpose but the blame does not lie with those who work in the health service, it lies here and with the previous Administration.  The CSO attended a recent health committee meeting and said the financial system was not fit for purpose.  If the architecture of the HSE and the financial system are not fit for purpose, what chance do we have of running a service?  We need to know when the new governance system will be in place and up and running.  We also need to know if the financial system will be reformed.  In the absence of the urgent address of both of these issues, it will be impossible to run the service within budget.

#EamonnMaloney	unknown-#EamonnMaloney-party	unknown-#EamonnMaloney-dob	unknown-#EamonnMaloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	472	On the motion, which is essentially about budgeting and criticism of the Government in terms of shortcomings in the health service, one thing people on this side of the House will not be doing is taking master classes from those who previously ran the health service for 14 years.  I am speaking in this regard not alone of the Fianna Fáil Party, but of the other parties and hangers on who, in terms of their speeches on this motion, were singing a different tune in their contributions during previous budget debates on health in this House.It must be acknowledged that we have all been taught a lesson by the previous Administration.  During the eight years between 1997 and 2005, Ireland's health budget tripled from €3.7 billion to €11.5 billion.  No one can say the previous Government did not spend money on health.  However, despite the increase in that short time, in 2006 Ireland ranked 25th among the 26 countries included in the euro health consumer index.  There is something very wrong in a Government having spent this huge volume of public money on health services for a population equivalent to that of the greater Manchester area which now has such difficulties.  There are legacy issues here.There has been much talk from all sides about the need for the health system to be reformed.  Our health system does not need to be reformed, rather it needs to be revolutionised.  Despite all of the spending in this area by the previous Government, in respect of which no one can criticise it because that was the outlook it took, it did not work.  As such, money is not the problem.  It certainly was not the problem during the eight year period from 1997 to 2005.  There are vested interests in health and hospitals but no one has taken them on and that is the reason we have the system we have.  As I stated, our health service does not need to be reformed, rather it needs to be revolutionised and the vested interests must be stood up to.I remind Members on the opposite side that the previous Administration, supported by others, spent more time during its final ten years in office advocating private medicine, private hospitals and tax breaks in that regard and that it was this Government and the current Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, who ended the advance of the concept of private hospitals.  We do not need more private hospitals, but a better public service.  The previous Administration advocated the spending of more money in the private medicine-hospital area.In revolutionising the health system we must first ensure equality.  Inequalities and snobbery in education aside, there are many inequalities in our health system.  In this country a person with money can get the best health care he or she desires while the person with no money has to join the queues.  That is where we are at today.  Notwithstanding that, the Opposition has to do what it must do.  I am sure we will be faced with a similar motion next week.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, for all of his shortcomings in the past 15 months, has never pretended that our health system would be changed in a year or five years.  It will not be.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is suffering from self-delusion.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I welcome to the opportunity to speak on this motion.  We all recognise the importance of securing the Department of Health budget and the need for it to be ring-fenced for the areas of most need.  This means that savings need to be achieved and changes need to be made.I would like to focus this evening on the possible introduction of a patient database and prescription cloud database.  Europe is heading down the e-health path, which means significant changes for patients and health professionals.  One might ask how e-health care benefits patients and saves money.  First, it allows for better data management and the collection of thorough information from patients, with attention to detail and delivery of same to clinicians in a coherent way.  The more informed the doctor and patient, the better the delivery of care for all concerned.  This would also result in fewer medication errors, fewer misdiagnoses and more optimised and coherent care plans.As health care chains extend, the availability of shared patient information by way of a prescription cloud database, using unique medical records and PPS numbers, would result in the delivery of more coherent treatment.  Spend per week by the HSE on pharmaceuticals, including payments to pharmacists, is estimated to be €3 million.  As the prescription rate continues to increase, a central database, monitoring the dispensing of prescriptions, in particular, pain killers, is essential not alone from a financial perspective, but from a health promotion point of view.The deadly problem of abuse of prescription drugs grew dramatically as they became increasingly available in our society.  The introduction of databases would provide pharmacies with information on purchasers of prescription pain killers.  A person who "doctor shops" and visits multiple pharmacies would easily be caught by a pharmacist checking the system.  By requiring doctors to check the database before prescribing pain pills and pharmacists to monitor prescription usage, drug seekers can be caught and stopped more often.  Use of this database in doctors' offices and pharmacies could help curb the excess buying of prescription pain killers.A patient database system, such as the introduction of a patient medication card similar to that used in Denmark, would result in a more efficient health care service where mistakes are eliminated, data is transferred more efficiently and administration costs are reduced.  Danish health care providers have been using an e-health system since 1996. Denmark's electronic patient medication card has helped eliminate errors and speeded up the flow of information.The Danish national e-health portal was launched in 2003.  It is a single access point to health care services for citizens and health professionals alike.  Using a digital signature, Danish citizens can log on to their personal web space and use a variety of services, including reviewing their medication records and health data and communicating withhealth care authorities.  They can also register their final wishes in a living will and become organ donors.  The introduction here of a patient medication card, similar to the one used in Denmark, would create a more efficient health care service where mistakes are eliminated, data is transferred more efficiently and administration costs are reduced.  In the same way as a bank ATM card allows a person to access information relating to his or her bank account, a patient medication card allows him or her and medical care providers to access medical records and medication details.  It provides direct access and up-to-date shared data about a patient's details and medical records.Health care providers can upload information onto a secure and shared record system, accessible by way of the patient medication card, allowing, for example, a GP to upload details of a medical prescription, which pharmacists can then access and fill on demand.  While the cost of implementing such a system in Denmark was initially expensive, it is estimated that by the end of 2008 the cumulative benefit was €1.4 billion in savings to the Exchequer.  Messages and data transmitted by electronic communication have now reached more than 4.5 million items per month and health-care providers have benefitted from effective and efficient data transfer and greatly reduced administration costs.  The patient has also benefited as there is faster, more reliable communication between health-care providers.Similarly, a four-week UK study of 36,200 prescriptions found that 1.5% had a prescribing error, 25% of which were potentially serious.  Aside from the human cost, medication errors represent a considerable avoidable expense for health-care providers.  Now electronic medication records in Denmark and the Netherlands track all the medication that individuals have been given to identify who has taken what, how much and when.  This information is available to providers and prescribers of medication - public pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, doctors' offices, locum posts, hospitals, mental health institutions and residential care and nursing homes.  It is just one possible solution to address our ever-increasing health spend and I would like to present it to the Department with a view to having it reviewed.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I will start by challenging some of the cynical politics this evening and last night on this motion and in particular its wording.  Before I was elected to this House I believed that politics - on any side of the House - was about being constructive.  While we all have our viewpoints we should bring something to the table other than criticism.  When those criticising were in many cases the people who gave us the difficulties we have and are just telling us what we need to do without acknowledging the financial constraints we have, it is a bit hard to take on this side of the House.  I accept our health service faces challenges, but we are also making great progress in how we are dealing with them.  I will focus on some areas where great progress is being made.My local general hospital in Naas, County Kildare, had a major issue with patients waiting on trolleys.  If even one person is on a trolley in Naas General Hospital this evening, that is one person too many.  However, in the first six months of 2011, some 2,982 people were on trolleys in Naas General Hospital.  In the first six months of 2012, that figure had reduced to 1,193, a reduction of 1,789 people on trolleys in the emergency unit in Naas General Hospital, which is 60%.  If that is not progress, I do not know what is.  Great credit is due to the Minister and his fact-based analysis of where the difficulties are.  There have been reductions throughout the country - I took the example of my local hospital and I acknowledge the role the management and staff there played.  However, further challenges remain in that regard.St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy in south County Kildare is a fantastic facility.  It is a community hospital that has offered great respite throughout the years and has a long and varied history.  It is one of the biggest employers in the town and has an excellent dementia-care unit.  I was delighted the Minister came to the hospital and saw at first hand the great level of care the staff and management at St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy give.  It recently received HIQA certification for the coming years.  As the Minister saw it is an old building with many challenges.  However, it got significant investment at a time when money is very scarce to ensure it could get fire certification and all the other boxes were ticked to achieve the HIQA standard.  While further challenges need to be faced in the future, progress is being made.Never before have so many people had medical cards.  Catering for those people who need that State support puts great strain on the system.  Some 1.8 million have medical cards with 130,000 people having GP-only medical cards.  No previous Minister for Health faced a challenge on that scale and yet we are making progress.There has been a reduction of 8,000 people working in the health system since 2007.  The overall health budget has reduced by €2.5 billion in the past three years.  Progress is being made in areas such as the special delivery unit over the past 16 months since we came into power and since the Minister, Deputy Reilly, assumed the position of Minister for Health.  That any progress has been made in light of those figures is astonishing.  However, some challenges in our health service remain to be tackled, including the use of agency workers and nurses.  I have previously said in the House that where agency nursing staff are more expensive to hire we should look for some leniency from the troika to allow us to increase our staffing numbers because there are great challenges for permanent nurses who have to work when agency nurses have flexibility to pick and choose their hours.When I researched the statistics before speaking I was struck that 17% of our health budget is spent on drugs compared with 9% in the NHS.  The figure jumped out and we need to investigate it.  There must be an enormous cost in the HSE not taking back walking aids, crutches and orthopaedic chairs, and savings could be made in that area.  Overall the trolley numbers I mentioned and the work by the special delivery unit in reducing the 12 month waiting list by 95% show real progress.  If that is what we have done in 16 months, it will be very interesting to see how the coming years pan out.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I will use my time to deal with the figures on suicide that were published today.  The Central Statistics Office published figures for 2011, which show that 525 people died by suicide last year, an increase of 7%.  Some 438, 84%, were men and 86 were women.  I want to highlight that serious issue.  There were also a further 65 undetermined deaths.  In most western countries they are accepted as suicide and included in the suicide figures.  Looking at it in totality and bearing in mind that these are provisional figures, in excess of 600 people died by suicide last year, which indicates a very serious public health issue.  Understanding why it happens is very difficult because suicide is a highly complex issue.I will deal with two points.  First, the area of mental health and suicide prevention has been neglected over decades.  I am not pointing the finger at anybody.  In fact the former Minister of State, John Moloney, probably contributed to addressing the issue more than anybody else along with the present Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  While there is movement in the area, we still have a serious issue because of the traditional neglect of mental health services and suicide prevention.  While not all suicide victims suffer from mental illness, more than 80% of those who die from suicide have a mental health difficulty.The other point is the link between suicide and economic recession.  It has been well established internationally that unemployment and the threat of unemployment is a leading predictor of suicide.  Research indicates that for every 1% increase in unemployment there is a 0.78% increase in the rate of suicide.  During times of economic recession, the loss of employment or income, financial pressure, pressure on mortgage repayments and the loss of a home or the threat of the loss of a home are extremely stressful.  Especially vulnerable people suffer from anxiety, hopelessness and despair, which lead to depression often creating relationship problems, and there is a higher level of marriage breakdown and divorce.  Of course some people take solace in alcohol and drugs which are very serious in regard to levels of suicide.Alcohol consumption plays a role in the incidence of suicide.The Government allocated €35 million in the recent budget for mental health services and it is vital that money is spent on them.  We must be vigilant in ensuring the HSE spends the money where the Government decided it should be spent, namely, on the development of mental health services.  When moneys were allocated for these services in 2006 and 2007 only 50% of the allocation was spent on them.The first step in the development of mental health services is to develop community based mental health services and the Minister has targeted this area.  Currently, 150 new postholders are being recruited in the child and adolescent psychiatry area and 254 new postholders in the adult psychiatry area.  These are multidisciplinary postholders - they are not psychiatrists or psychotherapists - namely, counsellors, nurses, occupational therapists, family therapists etc.  We must be concerned at the level of progress that has been made to date to establish the 90 community based multidisciplinary teams that are planned for the mental health services.  We have a high level of institutional treatment of the mental health service, one of the highest levels in Europe.  People should be treated in their community as far as possible.  These 90 community based multidisciplinary psychiatric teams are across four regions and each one will service a population of 50,000.  It is important that programme is completed as quickly as possible and, having regard to the Minister's plan, that we are vigilant in ensuring that the HSE does so.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I welcome the Minister.  I find the motion before us laughable given the history of the Members opposite whose party when in government was quick to run from having responsibility for the Department of Health.  It offered that responsibility to Mary Harney, the previous Minister, as if it was the Sam Maguire or Liam MacCarthy Cup and happily ran to the backbenches and the plinth every time there was a problem in health.  In the motion before us there is no proposal for reform.  There is no single proposal - not one line - in it on how we as a nation can run our health service.  The 14 years in government were lost on the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party opposite.It is important that we consider this motion in current context.  I advise Deputy Kelleher that we would all love to have a pot of gold but when it comes to health the reality is that we had a 14-year boom and bloom during which all that was done was that buildings were put up and inordinate amounts of money were spent on double jobbing and creating multiple layers of posts, the effect of which led to many departures from the health service under the retirement scheme in February.  That showed that the Croke Park agreement worked quite well.  That is a testimony to the staff in the health service who work hard and they and we have found that we have a Minister who is focused on reform.  The clinical programmes are delivering, be it in the case of day-care admission rates, more day-care patients being treated or in the reconfiguration process.  We have seen clinical leadership in the health service under the Minister, assisted by the Ministers of State, Deputies Shortall and Lynch.  During the past ten months we have seen increased flexibility and productivity, an increased innovative way of doing business and a reform agenda being pursued.  I want to pay tribute to the members who work in the health sector who have done this and who do not just see what they do as job.  I want that put on the record.There are different competing interests.  As an interested observer, I note that those interests often do not work in the same direction.  They seem to be in conflict.  We as legislators, those who work in the health service, commentators and members of the pubic must accept that we must have a patient-centred approach and focus to what we do in the health sector.  That requires that the competing interests step back and analyse what is best for our health sector.  We spend close to €13 billion annually on health.  That in an inordinate and extraordinary amount of money.  Money is not the answer to problems in our health services.  It is time those conflicting and vested interests were taken on.  The Minister has shown in his 18 months in power that he is a man willing to embark on reform, willing to take on the challenge of change and willing to embark on a different model of health service delivery.  We must take on the vested interests because we cannot go back to the same people all the time.Part of the reform agenda must be in the area of primary care.  We must change the mindset and attitude of the gnáth duine, the ordinary person, with regard to the accident and emergency department being the only place to go when one needs medical treatment.  It is not.This is like being on an oil tanker in the Atlantic Ocean - it takes a while to turn it around.  I am confident we will do that, but it requires patience, innovation and a plan, all of which the Minister and the Government have.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I welcome this opportunity to speak on the issue of health and I very much welcome the attendance of the Minister for Health in the Chamber.  When we talk about the issue of health, it is important to acknowledge, as my colleague Deputy Buttimer did, the work of the health professionals.  All too often since the creation of the HSE, we have an image of the health service being run by men and women in suits who brief us at Oireachtas committees but day in, day out health professionals, be they nurses, doctors or health care assistants, work in our hospitals and health centres and despite the financial difficulties and the reduction in their numbers, they get on with the job.  It is important to put on the record that surveys carried out reveal that patients' satisfaction with the level of care they receive once they access the service is very high.It is clear following the years of the Celtic tiger that money alone will not fix the health service.  We have seen that.  We have seen money being thrown at it, health budgets being hyped up every time there was an election and money thrown around with scant regard for what it would deliver.  What will fix the Irish health service is reform and management.  That is what the Minister, Deputy Reilly is about, and it is what Fine Gael and our colleagues in the Labour Party said in the general election campaign.  That is our commitment in the programme for Government.The Minister, Deputy Reilly and the Fine Gael Party never said that reform would be easy.  It is much easier just to throw money at problems.  Crucially the Minster and the Fine Gael Party never said it would happen overnight.  The Minster went further than that, he produced a timeline showing that the full reforms this party in government wants to introduce will take more than the lifetime of any one specific Government.  Already after a period of 15 or 16 months progress can be seen.  The figures do not lie.  With the establishment of the special delivery unit, as alluded to my colleague Deputy Heydon, we have seen a significant reduction in waiting lists: the 12 month list has been reduced by 95%, the 9 month list has been reduced by 55% and there has been a 19% year on year improvement in trolley waits.  These are trolley figures which show an improvement at a time when less money is being spent on the health service.  Already the reforms and the new structures are working.  We have seen an emphasis on the issue of primary care in the rollout of primary care centres and progress is being made in the rollout of free GP care.The Government has to untangle a massive mess.  The creation of the HSE was a disaster for the Irish health service.  It is ironic that the founder of the HSE, who is now the leader of his party, put down a motion bemoaning the very monster he established and imposed on the Irish taxpayer.I want to make a few points on issues I have noted in regard to the HSE when representatives of it have come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Part of the reason the HSE has such a deficit is due to the fact that it seems to operate in silos.  No one seems to talk to anybody else.  Every little section tries to make savings but there is no overall examination of the impact of these savings on the health service.  For example, it seems the procurement unit is so desperate to make a saving that it does not analyse the impact of that saving on the rest of the health care service.  This is out of sync with how modern health services work.  To use a simplistic example, a procurement section could decide that instead of buying a bandage for €12, it would buy one for €2, thereby saving €10 but that bandage might need to be changed by a community nurse who would visit a person in his or her home every day or every second day rather than once a week and the impact of that is not taken into account.  When we talk about savings in the health service, we need a much broader approach.  We need people to examine the whole health care impact, the impact on the patient and the saving across the system.It was astonishing that when the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive was before the Committee of Public Accounts he could not tell me as a taxpayer, let alone as a parliamentarian, what increments are being paid out for people in the HSE earning €70,000, €80,000, €90,000 and more, this year.  We discuss public service and public service increments and the public service versus the private service.  It is entirely missing the point.  There are some very well paid people in the health service at very senior managerial level and I want to know how much they are earning and how much their salaries are being increased by.  The fact that the Accounting Officer could not give this information to an Oireachtas committee is quite astonishing.It is also equally astonishing that he appeared at a committee a week after the report on the death of children in care, many of whom died in the care of the HSE and he was unable to give me an assurance that all HSE staff are now complying with all guidelines and that there are no longer shop stewards telling people not to fill out referral forms and pieces of paper.Last night many speakers raised the issue of school-leavers with intellectual disabilities.  This is a real example of the system not working.  The HSE and the Department of Health are fighting, lobbying, squabbling with service providers.  I believe that service providers can do more but I also believe that the families of people with intellectual disabilities do not really care about the argument; they want the solution.The Government has had a very positive 15 or 16 months.  This motion is ironic and cynical at best and I look forward to watching the continuance of the agenda for reform under the Minister, Deputy Reilly.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I congratulate Deputy Kelleher on tabling this motion.  It provides the opportunity to discuss this important matter.  I am very concerned at the possible closures of wards and theatres as a result of cost-cutting measures to deal with a deficit of €500 million this year.  I ask if these figures were ever achievable.  I have spoken to hospital managers and they are genuinely worried about the budgetary position because of cuts to their allocations.  They find it difficult to make ends meet as a result.  I do not think savings in the cost of drugs have been achieved.  Every hospital will be forced to cut back on the use of agency staff and this is true of the Galway hospitals.  The figures I have seen indicate that the cost of hiring agency staff has doubled in the period from 2008 to the present.  A question arises as to which services will be cut.I wish to speak about the HSE west region because it is the area I know better.  Along with others I am concerned about the waiting times for procedures and whether those waiting times will get longer.  The mental health services in Ballinasloe - a town I represent - and in other hospitals in Sligo, Galway and Clare have seen the closure of acute beds in psychiatric hospitals.  A total of €35 million has been allocated to mental health services of which €24 million is dedicated to community-based teams for adults and children.  It is important to ring-fence that funding.I refer to the excellent service providers for those with disabilities in County Galway and in the western region.  I wish to pay tribute to Ability West in particular.  The Brothers of Charity have done tremendous work for people with intellectual disabilities and autism.  It is important to have these services as local as possible.  I represent a rural area and I still see people having to travel to Galway city or further to access these services.  Ability West has special schools in Ballinasloe, in Carraroe, in Tuam and in Galway city.  The Minister will know that a new centre will be opened in Mountbellew on Friday, 20 July.  Ability West is providing high quality services and supports to over 500 children and adults with intellectual disability.  The Brothers of Charity services empower people with intellectual disability and autism to live their lives as they choose.  There has been a transformation in the way supports and services are provided and this is in line with best international practice.  The Brothers of Charity are forming partnerships with each individual and family because it is important to design a service plan for each person with an intellectual disability.  They are providing opportunities for valued social roles in their communities for people with disabilities.I refer to the acute reduction in bed numbers at St. Brigid's hospital in Ballinasloe.  I also refer to the future of the property attached to hospitals like St. Brigid's and the use of the funds arising from the sale of land or property which I contend should be put back into mental health services.  I support the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which, through the Ballinasloe voluntary housing project, is trying to provide housing for the elderly.I would like to see a museum established on the hospital grounds at St. Brigid's hospital to preserve memorabilia when the residents finally move out.  I ask the Minister to consider the funding for the home help service as it provides a range of services for clients who are mainly elderly people in order to help them remain in their own home rather than moving to nursing home care.  SIPTU has taken up the issue of an agenda of privatisation of the service.  The most important issue is to avoid any reduction in home help hours.  The advocacy group, Age Action, has called for an urgent review of the draft guidelines which the HSE uses to restrict home help services.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has also spoken out against a restricted service.  Eamonn Timmons of Age Action has said that if the service is inadequately resourced and is then restructured to operate without sufficient funding and personnel, it will result in a service which poses a threat to the well-being of the very people it sets out to protect.The Galway hospice services were established in 1990.  It started with only one doctor and one full-time and one part-time nurse.  It provides services to patients at home and also in the hospice centre.  Carers also need to have respite from their duties.  Galway hospice does not receive equity of funding.  It seeks to be treated no less favourably by the HSE than comparable services in other counties.I welcome the funding for a diploma in special dental care to upskill six dentists to address services for homeless people.  One of these six dentists will be assigned to the west and I ask that these dentists be assigned as quickly as possible.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I welcome the opportunity to speak on an issue as important and emotive as our health service, a service which affects every family on this island.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher on bringing forward this motion and highlighting the gross mismanagement of the HSE.  The Minister will speak later about the mismanagement of his affairs but this does not concern me.  What concerns me are the finances and the level of services which are currently provided by the HSE.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he said he would be a hands-on Minister; he said he would roll up his sleeves and that the buck would stop with him.  There was a great sense of expectation.  The Minister is a medical professional with many years of experience in medicine.  It was thought he knew exactly what he wanted to do and what reforms he would introduce in the health service.  However, little has happened, apart from the abolition of the board of the HSE and the establishment of the special delivery unit which has effectively replaced the National Treatment Purchase Fund.We all understand the precarious financial situation of the country and while we may disagree fundamentally on how this has happened we all agree there must be reductions across the board to balance the books and to return sustainable finances for the future.  This is the first time those of us on this side of the House have not had to listen to accusations it is all our fault.  Instead we are discussing a potential deficit of €500 million, according to the Minister's own figures and those of his Government's 2012 budget.  What is becoming patently clear is that the Minister was far from honest when he produced the Estimates for 2012.  The Minister spoke of saving approximately €124 million in drugs payments as a result of a new pricing agreement with the industry.  That is unachievable.  The budget provided for additional income of €140 million from increased private income, of which €75 million would come from charging private patients for using public beds.  According to the chief executive officer of the HSE, that assumption is not yet deliverable.  The Minister spoke about reducing agency costs by 50%, given that agency staff would cost over €200 million this year.  The CEO of the HSE has also said that this target is unrealistic.It is quite clear that what the Minister proposed, and what the Government stood over, was grossly misleading, dishonest and false.  As a result, we now face potential bed closures, ward closures and even the potential closure of hospitals.  There are delays with the fair deal and it is taking weeks and months for medical cards to be processed.  There are huge waiting lists.  All Members of the House acknowledge the quality of care patients receive once they get into hospital.  However, that is due to the dedication of the staff in the hospitals, who are stretched to breaking point.  What is the Minister's response to that?  What has happened to his and the Government's promise to protect front line services?  Can the Minister give a clear commitment tonight on where the savings will now be made to reach his targets, while protecting front line services?  There is serious worry among the public about this.Again, I offer the example of the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar.  Government backbenchers have asked for examples of where savings can be made.  The Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar is the most efficient and effective hospital outside Dublin.  The Minister visited it recently, albeit secretively.  The Government has promised that the money will follow the patient.  I have the leaflets that were distributed by colleagues in my constituency.  They state that Mullingar hospital will do better under Fine Gael, with more services and increased funding.  That is not the case.  Last year it cost €60 million to run the hospital but this year the budget is €56.4 million, including an overrun of €1.9 million.The numbers using the hospital have increased while funding has decreased.  The numbers have increased because the Minister reneged on the commitment given on Roscommon hospital when he closed its accident and emergency service.  The numbers have also increased because the Minister reneged on his commitment on Navan hospital when it was downgraded.  More patients are coming to the Midlands Regional Hospital from that area.

I said I speak to them every day; I do not have to be at the hospital.  It is a great pity that the Minister is not present at a few more hospitals.  We might not be in the mess we are in now.Where is the commitment to the money following the patient?  I raised this issue previously in respect of an empty unit of the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar that is lying idle, despite the number of patients attending the hospital.  I am aware of what happens to them when they go there.  A member of Westmeath County Council, who is an inter-county hurler, dislocated his finger recently.  When he went to the Midlands Regional Hospital he was put on a chair in an administrator's office because the hospital was at full capacity.  When the trolley count is conducted, I wonder if it includes the patients that are left sitting behind the desks.  I telephoned him to ask how he was and he told me that the hospital would shortly have him answering the telephones.Last week, I tried to get a medical card for a person who was due to be discharged from St. James's Hospital.  The person had been medically approved to be discharged and the only thing he was waiting for was a medical card, which he needed to get the necessary equipment to go home.  He was over a week waiting for the medical card, which meant a number of additional nights in the hospital.  What is it costing when one part of the HSE cannot telephone another part?  The hospital could not telephone the medical card section to inform it that the man could go home if he received his medical card.  We must seriously examine where we are going.I also wish to highlight the important issue of mental health services, an area that has been the Cinderella of the health service for far too long.  Will the Minister for Health reaffirm the commitment to the ring-fenced funding of €35 million for community mental health services?  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, reaffirmed it last week during a Topical Issue debate, but there were reports in The Irish Times last Saturday that the earmarked €35 million could be used to shore up deficits.  I ask the Minister to clarify and reaffirm the Government’s commitment to the €35 million in funding for community mental health services.  He has already confirmed that a number of posts due to be ring-fenced for the community mental health sector have been diverted to inpatient mental health services, albeit on a short-term basis.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I welcome the Minister and look forward to his contribution on the motion tabled by our spokesperson on health, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  I compliment Deputy Kelleher for tabling the motion because it provides all Members with an opportunity to set out our concerns about the issues involved.I will not start by beating the standard drum of blaming the Minister for everything.  He has taken on the difficult job of delivering a health service.  It is a difficult job in every jurisdiction in the world.  Due to its nature of being demand led, at times there is an insatiable appetite on the part of some to have certain things done that are not always possible.  It would be better if Members of this House contained themselves to the facts rather than to some of the excited spin that circulates.  However, that also falls on the Minister's shoulders and on those of the Government backbenchers.  It does not help when some of them seek to suggest that there is an air of hypocrisy or cynicism on the part of this side of the House.We faced this problem for a number of years, certainly from when I was first elected to this House in 2007.  I accepted some very tough decisions on reconfiguration that were taken by the previous Government.  I received little support from anybody in the Minister's party or from members of the Labour Party.  They put together outrageous statements which they could not stand over now.  I question the media in terms of them holding people to account.  They will hold the Minister and members of the Front Bench on this side of the House to account.  Sadly, the Minister is going through that in another forum at present which I consider to be outrageous and unnecessary.  However, that is neither here nor there.  The media hold people to account but they do not hold many members of the Minister's party to account, as they should be, for statements they made when in the Opposition prior to the election.The core issue is the lack of honesty in the preparation of the budget.  Other Members have spoken about this.  I am not suggesting it was necessarily at the Minister's direction but, unfortunately, as the Minister he must stand over it.  If claims were made by the Department in the preparation of the budget that set out a programme for the year, the issue is that the Minister is not in a position to give a clear statement that he can stand over it in a way that will ensure service will be maintained at its current level.  I believe there is a lack of honesty in the programme for Government, in the Fine Gael general election manifesto and in the Labour Party's manifesto.  There was a lack of honesty during the Minister's time in opposition and in the way in which he fanned the flames in an effort to create the impression among the public that it was just a matter of changing the personnel in Hawkins House and abolishing the board of the HSE.  The impression was created that dreadful people, including members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, or the former Government, had conspired with people within Hawkins House to foist some dreadful service on the people, yet the approach the current Government took when in opposition was to give the impression to the people that there was a simplified way and that one could proceed differently.  The Government is now experiencing the harsh reality that I suspect the Minister, who has experience in the health service, well knew about.  The Minister was a good advocate for the people he represented at the time in question.I was taken by Deputy Buttimer's reference to vested interests.  The Minister knows where the bones are buried in regard to dealing with the various vested interests.  For the reasons outlined, I believe a very dishonest approach was taken during the last election campaign.  The current Government knew the facts, set out its stall and alluded to a model in another European jurisdiction, the Danish model, about which we have heard very little since.  It involves an exceptionally expensive method of providing a health service with universal health care.  The Dutch model, unfortunately, has not been advanced at the rate expected.The Minister abolished the HSE, accepted political responsibility and turned the clock back.  Having done so, he must accept the personal responsibility this brings with it.  We have seen the unsavoury letters between the Minister for Health and a Labour Party Minister.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Health sit around the same table, yet the former has to write to the latter.  Perhaps that is how they operate.  It is quite unedifying to see a Labour Party Minister lecture a Fine Gael Minister on the imposition of cutbacks, although this says more about the Labour Party than it does about the Minister for Health.  It is good to see the Minister for Health fighting his corner to ensure the continued provision of appropriate funding.  However, if the current overrun is to continue - the numbers are set out clearly - we will reach a figure of €500 million by the end of the year.A couple of facts are clear.  The Minister may not have had the benefit of hearing the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions this morning.  He made it very clear to the leader of my party that there would not be a supplementary budget.  Sadly, the Minister is left following the desire of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which involves imposing significant cutbacks to honour the dishonest Estimates created as part of the budget and meet the target for the end of the year.  As others stated, this can mean only one thing, namely, that the level of service will have to be cut.I have heard others say it is not a question of money.  Of course, it is a question of money.  Others have suggested that because there was a tripling or quadrupling of investment in the health service since 1997, money was somehow not a problem.  They state that, in spite of investment, there are still problems in the health service.  The reality is that the cost of delivering the service has increased, as has the cost of drugs.  When Fianna Fáil left power, the service that was delivered, including at community level, was far better than it was in 1997.  Using selective indicators, some suggest that the health service became worse between 1997 and 2011.  The Minister knows that is not the truth.

He knows the level of service is much better now than in 1997.  It is entirely dishonest to suggest that is not the case.  The Minister should accept what has been achieved since 1997.  He should accept there is a much better service and that the investment was not wasted, which is, sadly, what people are suggesting from the backbenches tonight.  The latter are saying that, in spite of all the money invested, nothing was delivered.

The Minister used to be on the other side of the House in opposition and representing a special-interest group.  He ratcheted it up well and good when he was representing the IMO and the GPs and when dealing with the medical cards for those over 70.  I have no doubt he would have been outside the gates had the deal not been done.  The Minister should accept there were many other actors on stage and that he was a significant one.  He is now a significant actor on the other side of the House.  He should accept that he now has responsibility in this regard.During the course of the reconfiguration process in County Clare, representatives of Fine Gael and the Labour Party hijacked the airwaves and played politics.  They stated that if the accident and emergency units were closed at night, 20 people would die.  I want them to stand over these statements.  The closures were brought about to protect patients.  Having centres of excellence was all about ensuring patient safety.  It was a question of having no staging process on the way to tertiary care.  I got it in the neck from Fine Gael backbenchers at the time of the reconfiguration; they talked about people dying.  I encourage Members to follow through regarding the representatives in their parties who set up the hijacking process and suggested 20 people would die.  We should be told if 20 people are dying each year and what will be done about it.  Will the representatives accept that what they said at the time was wrong?  Little credit was given to us for doing what we did.I want the Minister to answer some of the questions that have been raised tonight.  Perhaps he will have an opportunity to do so when summing up.

People across the country and I want to see improvements to the health service.  We want to see a reduction in waiting lists, hospitals operating effectively, health service reform and a system in which people without private health insurance can obtain a hospital appointment for a required service without being told they need to provide cash that they do not have.There are undoubtedly health services that need to be improved.  Unfortunately, since the Government took office, these issues have not been addressed.  We have not seen the improvement promised by the Minister when he was on this side of the House, nor have we seen the improvement he proposed to the electorate.  Instead, the Minister, who promised universal health insurance for all, has overseen in his first year in office a system in which more than 1,000 people per week give up private health insurance cover only to become dependent on the public system, thereby putting further pressure on the latter.To ensure the money being invested in the health service is spent directly on the services being delivered, we need proper planning in the HSE itself.  Unfortunately, this year's regional health service plans were proposed to the Minister only around the end of January.  It was approximately in March that the national health service plan for this year was adopted.  Therefore, the actual plan for 2012 was not adopted until approximately three months into the year.  How can this ensure the money invested leads to the treatment and service desired?In Donegal today, the local HSE announced that a bus service that has in recent years been bringing patients in the morning to Dublin for treatment in various hospitals is to be discontinued.  I ask the Minister to look into this.  The patients affected simply cannot hop on an express bus.  In many cases, they are sick or have ailments of a kind that require the service in question.   It reflects a lack of planning, in that the Minister has thrown the HSE a budget and told it to deal with the situation as best it can while giving little or no attention to the impact on services on the ground.Will the Minister redouble his efforts and act on the rhetoric that we saw from him while he was in opposition?  Will he show signs of making progress, that is, improvements in the health service rather than more confusion and a daily game of catch-up?  I commend the motion to the House.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Much of the Deputy's comments were revisionist.  The Government has been tackling the crisis in a structured and systematic way.  The programme for Government sets out an effective way of addressing the challenges of excessive trolley times and waiting times for patients in day treatment.  Last year, the clinical programmes saved 70,000 bed days, amounting to €63 million.  Money is not the issue, but it allows us to treat more patients more quickly.  This is all about the patient.  If something does not improve the patient's journey or outcome, it is of no value to the Government.The fair deal supports 23,000 clients, representing a significant advance in the care of older people.  Since last September, 6,000 staff have left the health service, €1.57 billion has been cut from the budget in the past two years, a further €750 million will be cut this year and 3,500 people have been redeployed, yet there has been a 6% increase in emergency department admissions, a 7.1% increase in inpatient discharges and 1.8 million people are in receipt of medical cards, the highest number in the State's history.  In a short period, we have made significant progress in comparison with the abject failure of successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments.  Deputy Martin's legacy in health comprises 128 reports and 132 consultancies at a cost of €13.8 million.  Of course, this was the era of Noel Dempsey and the idea of what is €50 million among friends.

A measurable improvement has been brought about by the SDU and clinical programmes.  Most importantly, I want to thank the front line staff for their incredible endeavour in not just maintaining safe services, but in reducing the number of people on trolleys by 20% in the first six months of this year.  That is measurable.  It is not rhetoric or spin.  That figure represents nearly 10,000, but the total is still too large and more must be done.  More than 3,000 people were waiting for longer than one year for inpatient treatment, but that number has reduced to a little over 100.  We will move to a nine-month inpatient time.

The key message of this Private Members' Bill is to highlight the inefficiencies and inadequacies of the Government's proposals on health.  It is important to note that there is a €500 million deficit in the Department's budget.  What areas will be affected because of this shortfall?  Will the deficit be reflected in losses in staff and services for the people of County Louth and others nationally?I wish to address a number of issues.  First, will the shortfall of €500 million affect current long-stay hospitals, including the Drogheda Cottage Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital in Ardee?  These hospitals are on tenterhooks wondering what will happen to their long-stay patients.  Not only are patients concerned, but the staff are worried about what will happen and what the hospitals' futures will be.  The Minister is familiar with both hospitals.In the budget, an additional €35 million was allocated for mental health services, of which €24 million was dedicated to community-based teams for adults and children.  On 7 July, we were told:It is understood discussions in recent days suggested parts of a €35 million investment in mental health services could be used to offset overruns in that area.  This programme has been strongly championed by Labour Minister of State for Mental Health Kathleen Lynch.Will the promised 414 staff be recruited?  Will the funding for community-based services be ring-fenced as promised?  Will this be another broken promise by the Government?There is no national strategy on dementia care, but the programme for Government commits to putting such a strategy in place by 2013.  Will this commitment be impacted because of a lack of available funds?  An estimated 41,740 people suffer from dementia.  Projections suggest that this number will rise with an ageing population, yet the Government has made no strategic proposals.  This serious issue affects fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers across the country.  Who will be the voice for these people?  Government action is necessary now.  This is just one of the areas that are at risk and for which the Government has no plan in place to alleviate people's suffering or to aid their families.  Where is their care and support?We as a party believe that there are a number of ways in which the Government can realistically save money so that finance can be spent on serious issues, including dementia care and intermediate care.  For example, agency staff costs have almost doubled in four years and will be in excess of €200 million this year.  High agency costs are partly driven by absenteeism, which was at 5% in the HSE in the first four months of 2012 compared with a private sector average of 2.5%.  The total cost of taxis increased by almost 10% last year, increasing from €26 million in 2010 to €28 million in 2011.  Medical legal payments and costs were up from €39 million in 2008 to a projected €127 million in 2012.  Overtime was €170 million last year and €69 million in the first five months of this year.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, employs two special advisers, one of whom earns €92,000 per year.  In addition, two special delivery unit advisers are each on three-year contracts worth a total of almost €1 million.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Those are consultants to the special delivery unit.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Our motion reads as follows:That Dáil Éireann:— noting that the Health Estimate in budget 2012 was misleading given the fact that it was based on assumptions and targets that were not deliverable by the Minister for Health;— highlighting that enabling legislation for measures announced in the 2012 health Estimate have not been published seven months after being announced and therefore will impact greatly on the sector's ability to meet its budget targets;— agreeing that, 14 months after abolishing the Health Service Executive (HSE) board, the Minister has failed to take any legislative or other action in relation to governance in the HSE and that this has exacerbated the deficit;— acknowledging that the income streams or expected savings from:— the cost of public beds being charged to insurance companies;— drug pricing; and— reducing agency costs;will not now be achieved;resolves that the resulting €500 million overspend in the health budget will not have an impact on front line services and patient care; andrejects any moves to close wards, theatres or hospitals as a result of the failure to properly plan the health budget.Health is a significant challenge in the country.  It is capital and labour intensive by its nature.  Significant promises were made leading into the last general election and subsequent to it, and many of those promises have not been delivered.  It is necessary to tell the people of this country honestly and in an upfront manner exactly where they stand.  The abolished HSE board has not been replaced and it is not clear what will replace it.  The Minister has had a short period to address these issues.  At the earliest opportunity, he should address the various points made tonight.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I will confine my remarks to the motion before the House this evening and will await the personal statement from the Minister later in the House.  The Minister was attending a Council meeting in Cyprus last night, and he was entitled and obliged to be there.  At that time I argued that the 2012 budget and the health Estimate in particular was aspirational at best or completely dishonest at worst.  The recent comments by Mr. Cathal Magee, the chief executive of the HSE, have confirmed these suspicions.The HSE service plan and budget were overseen and approved by the Minister.  At the time the plan was to published, the Minister rejected the first draft.  He was effectively referring back a document drafted by his officials and departmental personnel, or, essentially, he was referring it to himself.  The Secretary General of the Department sits on the interim board of the HSE and the vast majority of the board is made up of members of the Department of Health.

That is the purpose of this debate.  We can talk about abstract figures but there are two choices facing the Minister.  We are in July and the budget deficit is running out of control.  We have yet to see any form of legislation required as a consequence of the 2012 budget to effect the savings highlighted at the time.  We are talking about savings in 2012 of €543 million, with most of this requiring legislative changes.  We have not seen the heads of Bills or the actual Bills.We are in July and the next opportunity to bring forward legislation will be September or October.  The Minister may say he can work miracles and believe he has amazing capabilities; he might have much confidence in his own ability.  Nevertheless, I assure the Minister that services will be affected and he will rob Peter to pay Paul with issues like mental health and disability services.  All the crocodile tears from the other side of the House will be in vain because there will be no ring-fencing.  Money will be taken from the budget to shore up what has been an abject failure in management.As the Minister noted, "the year ahead represents a huge challenge but also a great opportunity to change the way we work so we can deliver the health care we all desire for our citizens."  I concur with the statement but the only problem is that the Minister has not stepped up to the challenge.  He certainly has not grasped any opportunity because in the seventh month of 2012, the budget is in chaos.  That has been admitted to by those at the top of the HSE, unless the Minister is to dismiss the remarks of Mr. Magee at the committee which he and I attended.We are calling for the Minister to state clearly-----

It is disappointing the Minister did not use the opportunity to give a clear commitment he will address the budget deficit without attacking the front line services over which everybody on the Government side shed crocodile tears this evening and yesterday.  What matters is putting money where their mouths are.  On this occasion it is going into a big black hole because of the Minister's failure to bring forward legislation to effect the changes he stated in the House last December were necessary to ensure the budget would be effective and would deliver the services he so admirably promised in recent times.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	559	At the end of March of this year, there were 116,288 mortgage holders in serious distress.  This represents an increase of 8,580 since December 2011.  If we look from January through to March of this year, 95 mortgage holders fell into distress every day.  That figure is stark and worth repeating.  It is a shocking figure and also represents a significant acceleration of the mortgage crisis.  There has also been a significant increase in the number of repossessions in the first three months of the year.  Some 170 families lost their homes to repossession the first quarter - an increase of 28% on the last quarter of 2011.  Of course, these figures do not include the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of households which are not yet in serious distress but who are struggling every week to make payments and meet their mortgage payments, nor do the figures give us the real sense of hardship and stress caused to families from the crisis.  Let there be no doubt but every night there are people who must try to decide whether to pay their mortgage or put food on the table for their children.  That is the stark reality behind all these figures.  These families are struggling to cope with the impact of unemployment, under-employment or loss of income.  Their daily struggle is being made all the harder by VAT increases, the household charge and other measures imposed on them by the Government in last December's budget.It is worth remembering that Fianna Fáil created the mortgage crisis - it took place on its watch.  The policies of Charlie McCreevey, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen inflated the property market and saddled an entire generation with an astronomical level of personal debt.  While Fianna Fáil drove this economy over a cliff, hundreds of thousands of ordinary decent Irish citizens were left to pick up the pieces.  After 2009, when the full extent of the mortgage crisis became clear, what did Fianna Fáil do?  It formed an expert group which produced two detailed reports.  Did Fianna Fáil act on the recommendations in these reports?  Did it devote time and energy in its last months in office in an attempt to undo some of the damage it brought upon distressed mortgage holders?  It did not.  It sat on its hands and did nothing.  Throughout the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill, the role of Fianna Fáil in this crisis must not be forgotten.On coming into office Fine Gael and the Labour Party made a big promise.  They promised to deal with the issue of mortgage distress.  Almost a full page of their programme for Government was devoted to this issue but just like Fianna Fáil, the new Government commissioned an expert group to come up with solutions to the crisis.  The Keane report was published in October with a further round of recommendations.  It was, like Fianna Fáil's predecessor, cautious in approach, offering little in the way of real solutions to the vast majority of people affected by the crisis.Eight months have passed since the publication of the Keane report and 15 months have passed since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office.  In all of that time no meaningful measure has been put in place to stem the growing number of home owners in mortgage distress or to assist those weighed down by the pressure of arrears.  The approach of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to the crisis is characterised by exactly the same attitude as Fianna Fáil.  Until now they have adopted a hands-off, leave it to the banks approach - kicking the can down the road in the hope that something else or somebody else will address the problem.The quarter on quarter increase in the numbers of households in mortgage distress and the growing number of repossessions is evidence of the failure of the Government to take the mortgage crisis seriously.  Finally, after much delay - much of it at the behest of the banking industry - the Government published the long promised personal insolvency legislation.  Sinn Féin has been calling for this legislation to be introduced for a long time.  My colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, outlined in detail our position on the Bill and he will do so in further detail on Committee Stage.While we welcome the publication of this long overdue legislation, it will be a source of disappointment to the thousands of families in mortgage distress who were eagerly awaiting it and who held out hope that it would be a resolution to their problems.  When the heads of the Bill were published, Sinn Féin said that it was essential that the proposed insolvency service be independent and that a more humane approach to bankruptcy was needed.  We also argued that it should be non-judicial, include an appeals process, and, crucially, have the power to force reasonable solutions on lenders.  Unfortunately, this Bill gives lenders a veto over the personal insolvency arrangements.  This is not the right approach.The only other option open to people in serious arrears is bankruptcy.  The suggestion that the threat of bankruptcy gives the distressed mortgage holder some kind of leverage over their lender is a very dangerous one.  If it were the intention of the banks to genuinely work with home owners to make their mortgages more sustainable, then we would not be seeing such an increase is the distress figures.  The banks, like the Government, are not doing enough to assist families remain in their homes.  Sinn Féin will be seeking to amend this crucial legislation, in particular this crucial section, because without an element of compulsion on lenders, the mortgage crisis will, unfortunately, continue to grow.  It is also deeply disappointing that there is no appeals process built into the legislation.  Again, Sinn Féin will try to bring forward amendments to deal with this issue.While we welcome the shortening of the bankruptcy term from 12 to three years, we are mindful that anybody entering bankruptcy will lose all their assets, including their family home.  Since the start of this crisis, Sinn Féin has argued that the most important principle which must underlie Government policy is working with distressed mortgage holders to enable them to remain in their family home.  This will require, on a case-by-case basis, restructuring mortgages to make them sustainable and the lenders to absorb a portion of the losses in many cases.We have never argued for a blanket debt write-down.  However, we strongly favour a targeted debt resolution process in which banks accept responsibility for their part in the crisis.Given that last year alone the pillar banks received over €17 billion of taxpayers' money in recapitalisations there is simply no justification for banks refusing to absorb some of the cost of this crisis.  There is sufficient capital in the pillar banks to cope with a portion of the losses.Across the country people are looking to this House for solutions to the crippling level of debt and mortgage distress with which they are living.  They need the Government to intervene to give them some kind of hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  The Personal Insolvency Bill has the potential to provide tens of thousands of families with that hope, but only if it is amended appropriately.I hope the Minister will keep an open mind on the issues raised when we deal with the Bill on Committee Stage.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Figures released today by the Central Statistics Office record that the number of suicides has risen by 7% in the past year.  Some 525 people took their lives in 2011 although some believe the real figure was as high as 600, or even higher.  The figures for 2012 show another alarming rise in suicides with an average of three people a day taking their own lives, which could mean that the number of suicides may double this year.  Experts also agree that economic and financial problems have a major impact, with one report I have seen stating that every 1% increase in unemployment leads to almost an equivalent increase in suicides.Personal debt is clearly a factor as many people find themselves unable to cope with massive personal debts which they see no way of ever clearing.  Mortgage debt is clearly central to that and it is to be regretted that the Bill goes nowhere close to tackling that problem.  We require far more radical measures, including the need to address the issue of negative equity and the fact that many mortgages were taken on for houses which are no longer worth anything like what they were when the mortgage was taken out.  In many instances house prices were greatly inflated by reckless lending and the absence of accountability or control.  House prices were also inflated by the attitude of the Government at that time.Substantial numbers of people are in financial difficulties due to contracting mortgages and loans with sub-prime lenders.  Many now find it impossible to pay back the loans and have fallen into serious arrears due to unemployment and falls in income.  The banks themselves play a negative role in this.  Continually, people come to my clinics who are unable to meet mortgage repayments and are trying to negotiate interest only or reduced repayments for a period of time until the economy improves.  In many cases, the banks are not co-operating, nor are they co-operating with small businesses that are struggling to survive in order to keep people in employment.The banks are the country's new landlords.  It is the banks that are carrying out repossessions and taking over family homes, property and small farms.  They are filling the role of the landlords of 150 years ago.The situations caused by banks are greatly exacerbated in the case of certain lenders who charge huge interest rates, impose massive penalties on people in arrears and resort to proceedings to gain possession of properties, even when they have been given reasonable offers for repayment.  Some of those in that situation may perhaps be adjudged to have been ill-advised in taking on high interest loans, but in many cases they are people who were unable for various reasons to get mortgages and loans from the high street lenders.  Some have questioned the ethics of these lenders and it is not surprising that the most aggressive pursuers of repossessions are sub-prime lenders like Start.Some of you will also be aware of Wise Mortgages which is currently pursuing the repossession of a farm through the courts, even though the person concerned, whom I know personally,  has offered, with the help of his family, to repay the original principal.  Wise Mortgages is owned by Ronald Weisz, an American citizen who was declared bankrupt in the United States and has a conviction in Ireland in the District Court for attempting to get people to deposit money with him.  He is also in breach of Central Bank regulations, although the Central Bank advised the person against whom the repossession is being sought that the regulations do not apply to Wise as the company is not licensed by the Central Bank, nor is it subject to the provisions of the consumer protection code.I have written to the Central Bank about this matter and I am still awaiting a reply.  As public representatives, the Minister and I, with every Member of the House, are entitled to a reply to the questions we put to the Central Bank on behalf of a person who is being persecuted by vulture lenders such as Ronald Weisz who, I am told, resides in County Leitrim on an estate he has repossessed.This is surely a surreal situation.  It is also one that needs to be addressed through legislation, as such companies may be considered to be little, if any, better than illegal moneylenders.  That is a perfect description of this company.  I dealt with Wise Mortgages when I first came into this House.  Ronald Weisz, with the help of his cronies in the legal system, terrorised a small farmer not far from where I live and attempted to repossess his land.  The farmer borrowed a modest sum, of about €50,000, and Wise Mortgages wanted repayments of €150,000.  The initial interest rate was 9% but it rose to 18% when one payment was missed.There are lenders who ought not to be allowed to lend money.  One such company is Wise Finances, the financial company of Ronald Weisz.  He has convictions in the United States for fraud and also has a series of judgments against him in the US which led him to file for bankruptcy.  He was also taken to court in this country in 1995 for attempting to take in deposits, something he was not licensed to do, and charged and convicted under Section 27 of the Central Bank Act.  This led the then Minster, Mary Harney, to attempt in 1999 to tighten up the legislation governing lending but, unfortunately, there are still loopholes which require closing.  I hope the Government will legislate in order to deal with companies such as those of the vulture, Ronald Weisz.It was also claimed during the court case I referred to, that a licence formerly held by Wise Finances in the UK lapsed in May 2004, that the company was not an authorised lender after that date and that it was not regulated by the Central Bank.  Despite that, Mr. Weisz signed an affidavit for a court case in September 2004 claiming that the company was an authorised lender, which it was not under the conditions set out by the Central Bank.  The current Central Bank regulations on fitness and probity, approved last September, in section 5.2 state that a financial provider must be able to demonstrate that his or her role in a relevant function is not adversely affected to a material degree by the fact that one or more of the following may be applicable: the person is subject to a judgment debt which is unsatisfied either in whole or in part, whether in the State or elsewhere; the person is or has been the subject of a bankruptcy petition whether in the State or elsewhere; or the person has been adjudicated a bankrupt and the bankruptcy is undischarged, whether in the State or elsewhere.  That clearly applies to Mr. Weisz and Wise Finances.  However, the Central Bank has claimed that those regulations do not apply to Wise Finances as it is not registered with the Bank.  In that case, surely the company ought not be allowed operate in the first instance.Given that this company is currently in the process of attempting to repossess properties, including a farm in the west of Ireland, I would request that the Department of Finance and the Central Bank investigate the legality and status of the company concerned as a matter of urgency.  I would also be grateful if the Minister would investigate this matter.  He has been involved in unscrupulous money lending operations which have crippled decent and honourable people who were in a vulnerable position and looked to him for money.  He continues to operate but he has to be stopped.A farmer in the west of Ireland who I know personally is facing having his family farm repossessed even though he is making every effort to ensure the money he borrowed is paid back.  His extended family is supporting him in this objective.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  To set the debate in context, I recall knocking at the door of a house in Douglas in 2006 which was occupied by a couple.  The male partner was working in the pharmaceutical industry in Cork Harbour and the female partner was a public servant.  They were earning too much to qualify for affordable housing, which cost approximately €250,000 at that time, but too little to purchase a house on the open market.  As I walked away from their door that evening I thought something had to give if first time buyers cannot afford to enter a housing market which depends on new buyers.  One year later the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, made his famous suicide comment in response to those who warned that something was going wrong in the property sector and, in another context, announced that the boom was getting boomier.  We are now dealing with the bang that followed the boom.The Bill provides a range of workable options for those in mortgage or personal debt distress and presents a real opportunity for our country to recover.  Mortgage debt is a dead weight on households throughout the country and will finally be dealt with under the new legislation through personal insolvency arrangements.  After meeting certain criteria, struggling homeowners will now be able to enter into arrangements with their lenders to restructure some of their debts.  Options will also allow for families and individuals to remain in their own homes or downsize to an alternative home.  However, the Bill does not offer blanket debt forgiveness because this would unjustly allow those who will not pay to piggyback on those who cannot.The Bill also rebalances the relationship between borrower and lender and will ultimately ease pressure on distressed mortgage owners.  Banks faced with the prospect of no payments will be incentivised to engage in a meaningful way with borrowers to their mutual long-term benefit.  Over time this will help to normalise the mortgage market.  I am distinguishing the concept of recovery in the housing market from what we want to see in a normalised housing market.  The creation of debt relief certificates will allow for qualifying sums of unsecured debt of up to €20,000 to be written off, subject to three years of supervision.  Debt settlement arrangements will also allow for the settlement of larger amounts of unsecured debt over a period of five years.  The Bill provides a stick in this regard because banks which do not engage with distressed lenders in a meaningful way will face the threat of the legislation being used against them.  The inclusion of secured and unsecured debt through personal insolvency arrangements places Ireland to the forefront of states that are seeking to address the devastating impact of unsustainable debt by providing for settlement arrangements of both types of debt at the same time.This issue should not, however, be viewed in the context of a single Bill because a range of provisions are being introduced concurrently.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is rolling out the mortgage to rent scheme on a national basis to help families find a way out of what would otherwise be an impossible situation.  This scheme, which was piloted in February 2012, allows families in severe difficulty to arrange for their home to be bought by a housing authority from the bank at the current market rate.  The family can then rent the house completely unknown to neighbours or even loved ones and keep their children involved the local schools, sports clubs and activities that make their house their home and their local area their community.  It could also permit families to buy back their homes over time if their economic situation improves.The Personal Insolvency Bill is a mammoth and complex piece of legislation which runs to 150 pages.  It reforms laws that have been in place for over a century and seeks to ensure that better structures are put in place for all families not only those who are in difficulty.  The Labour Party has consistently promised to introduce legislation that would assist those who are struggling to pay their mortgages and deal with credit cards and other personal debts.  This legislation is delivering on the promise outlined in the programme for Government.However, it is not a blanket debt forgiveness scheme.  It has been put in place for those who are making an honest effort to pay their debts but can no longer afford their repayments.  A key principle of the Bill is that it is not about the size of the debt but rather the ability to service it.  There is no one size fits all solution and each case will be dealt with on an individual basis.  The last administration left behind an appalling legacy which saddled Irish citizens with crippling debts.  After 15 years of mismanagement, we finally have radical and workable legislation to deal with the debt crisis.  Those who are struggling to pay their debts can make an application through a personal insolvency practitioner who will sit down with borrowers to draw up the best plan for dealing with their debts.  Regulations will also be put in place to monitor the various provisions of the legislation.We must make sure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  Other measures, including a house price database, are necessary to put an honest and clear valuation on houses.  While this legislation seeks to correct the madness of the past we must not forget that Ireland is a home buying nation.  We must normalise the housing market by putting in place proper rules for the future so people can once more buy a home without competing in a market where houses are favoured by Government policy as a commodity for investment purposes.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-11 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to make a personal explanation, arising from questions raised in the House yesterday, which will outline the circumstances by which my name came to appear in Stubbs Gazette.  I believe this explanation will show fellow Deputies that I have at all times acted with complete propriety and that the problem stems from complicated litigation surrounding an investment made 12 years ago.In November 2000, I entered into a co-ownership agreement for the purchase and development of lands at Greenhills, Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, for use as a nursing home.  I was one of 13 co-owners who bought the lands for the purpose of building a nursing home and then leasing the home to a nursing home operator.  I hold just over a 9% share in the co-ownership.The co-ownership agreement provided for two categories of co-owner, namely recourse co-owners, of whom I am one of five, and non-recourse co-owners, of whom there are eight.  Under the terms of the co-ownership agreement, the eight non-recourse co-owners were entitled to be bought out in June 2011.The construction of the nursing home was completed by July 2001.In that month, Dr. Dilip Jondhale and Dr. Vasudha Jondhale signed a lease for the premises to operate a nursing home business.  Dr. Jondhale and his wife are the owners of the Greenhill Nursing Home business and not the co-ownership.  It is important to clarify, however, that Dr. Dilip Jondhale was also one of the original five recourse co-owners.I have already told Deputies that the current difficulties stem from complex litigation and I feel it is important to give the House information in that regard.  In May 2004, Dr. Vasudha Jondhale wrote to the co-owners indicating that the nursing home was not fully completed and the tenants were unhappy to pay further rent.  This was responded to by correspondence confirming the building was complete and calling on the tenants to pay rent as it fell due along with all arrears.Solicitors' correspondence ensued and ultimately proceedings were issued for the recovery of rental arrears from the nursing home business.  Those proceedings were taken in 2009 in the High Court against Dr. Dilip Jondhale and Vasudha Jondhale - High Court record No. 2009/1012S.Then in January of last year, before the last general election, I sought to dispose of my interest in accordance with the terms of the co-ownership agreement by offering my interest to the other co-owners.  However, a buyer could not be found at that stage.Subsequently, following my appointment to the Government in March 2011, I granted a power of attorney to my solicitor for the purposes of doing all acts necessary to dispose of my interest in the co-ownership.  On 4 April 2011, a second transfer notice was served by my solicitor as my attorney seeking again to dispose of my interest at a reduced price.  Once again this was not taken up by any of the co-owners.As you already know, the non-recourse co-owners were due to be bought out in June 2011.  However, a further dispute arose in relation to the terms of a new lease to be granted to the nursing home operators and it was not possible to resolve matters at that stage.  Accordingly the non-recourse co-owners instituted proceedings against the recourse co-owners in the Commercial Court in July 2011.In October 2011, my attorney having failed to dispose of my interest despite several attempts to do so, and in circumstances where it had not been possible to resolve matters with the nursing home operators, I sought the advice of the Standards in Public Office Commission under section 10(12) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.Discussions with the Standards in Public Office Commission initially centred on the creation of a blind trust to set aside my interest for such period as I remained a Minister.  The establishment of such a blind trust would have involved the transfer of my interest to a trustee and in those circumstances required bank consent.  Bank consent was sought.  However, the bank felt it would be inappropriate to grant consent to such a transfer in circumstances where litigation was in being in the Commercial Courts.Subsequently, the Standards in Public Office Commission advised that it would be acceptable to proceed by way of a power of attorney provided the power of attorney gave the attorney complete and unfettered discretion to deal with my interest in the nursing home as he or she deemed fit and provided that person satisfied the conditions of the public ethics legislation.This advice was received early in January 2012 and on 12 January 2012 a power of attorney was granted to a third party solicitor in compliance with the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001, and in accordance with the Standards in Public Office Commission advice.  The third party solicitor is a different solicitor to the one originally given power of attorney to dispose of my interest in the property.I hope it is clear to Deputies that I sought at all times to comply fully with my obligation under the Standards in Public Office Act and the Code of Conduct for Office Holders.In November 2011, the failure to agree new terms of a lease with the nursing home operator after the expiry of the initial term resulted in proceedings being issued in the Circuit Court against the nursing home operator, seeking to fix the terms of a new lease to be granted after the expiry of the initial ten-year term.  The proceedings in the Circuit Court impacted upon the recourse parties' ability to secure funding to acquire the interest of the non-recourse co-owners.In the Commercial Court, the recourse co-owners agreed to the judgment in February of this year and a stay on the execution of the judgment was granted until 30 April.  It had been hoped to resolve all litigation, including the Circuit Court action, prior to 30 April to enable the recourse parties to proceed to raise the required funds.  In this context the matter was to be dealt with by the attorney appointed by me together with the other parties.  However, it was not possible to meet this deadline due to court adjournments.I can advise the House, however, that the Circuit Court proceedings have been settled and a new lease is being finalised.  I am assured by my attorney that very significant efforts are underway to agree a methodology by which the non-recourse co-owners can be paid.As previously indicated, my interest in the total co-ownership of the property is just over 9%.  This is equivalent to 25% of the recourse co-owners' interest.  My attorney cannot compel parties to reach a resolution in circumstances where my interest is a minority interest but, as I have said, I am assured by my attorney that every effort is being made to resolve matters.In accepting the judgment, it is clear that it is the intention of the recourse co-owners to meet our financial obligations and those will be met.  The means of dealing with the judgment have been impacted by other court proceedings, one of which is now resolved and the second was the subject of a judgment in favour of the co-owners by the High Court, which although under appeal is not anticipated to impact upon a resolution as it relates to historic rent arrears.In the circumstances, my attorney believes that it will be possible to reach a resolution of the issues.  I do very much regret that it has not proved possible to reach agreement in advance of being named in Stubbs Gazette.I would like now to turn my attention to one or two issues, if I may, that have been raised.  There has been a suggestion that I might have a conflict of interest because of my share in a property that houses a private nursing home.  I would like to state very clearly on the record of the House that nothing could be further from the truth and I say so for three reasons.  First, I am not the operator of the Greenhill Nursing Home.  I never have been.  That business is run independently.  Second, I have been attempting to divest myself of my interest in the property for 16 months.  Third, my single interest here is the well-being of our older persons.I have repeatedly stated that I believe too many of our older people are being placed in long-term care and should instead be in their own homes.  Health journalists and others know this already, but I will shortly be announcing a major new initiative aimed at empowering older people to stay in their homes rather than go into long-term care at all.I have already revealed that €28 million will be invested in a range of measures, including new pathways through our hospitals, with the intention of giving the greatest possible assistance to older persons to stay in their homes, which the vast majority of people want to do.I do not have a conflict of interest.  I have a single interest and that is the best interests of older people and patients under our health services.I also remind Deputies that on being appointed as Minister for Health, I received a special leave of absence from my general-practitioner practice and I have had no hand, act or part in the day-to-day running of the practice since.Also, for completeness, I can advise the House that in advance of being appointed to Government I had intended to develop a primary care centre with partners in Nevinstown in Swords.  That project is not being proceeded with and the property is for sale.Finally, I say to my colleagues in this House that I entered politics late in life.  I did so in pursuit of no business interest whatsoever.  I did so because I passionately believe that we can provide better services to our citizens.  I passionately believe that we must put the patient at the heart of what we do in the health services.  That may sound like a slogan to some, but to me it is not.  It is the driving force behind the changes that I am putting in place in the health services with my colleagues.Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle.The Dáil adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 July 2012.
