          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the future of rail freight traffic and, in particular, the possible closure of passenger rail lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to give priority to the commencement of a six lane swimming pool at Tuam, County Galway, as Tuam is designated in the RAPID programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Finance to intervene with the National Lottery to ensure the existing service to Lotto players in 60 or so rural outlets will not be downgraded as this move will be another blow to the viability of these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Transport to give a commitment to road building projects and the reason, in the last two years of the national development plan, only 30 kilometres of motorway out of a target of 711 kilometres has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline to the House, before the USA embarks on war against President Saddam Hussein and the people of Iraq, Ireland's stance at the United Nations Security Council concerning the resolution presently under debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I regard the matters raised by Senators Mansergh, Kitt and Feighan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Browne may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise. I regret that I have to rule Senator Leyden's matter out of order as it is more appropriate for discussion on a substantive motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re establishment of Joint Committee on Standing Orders, to be taken without debate; No. 2, report of the Committee of Selection, which the Leas-Cathaoirleach will introduce from the floor and concerns the appointment of Members to the joint committees and the Committee on Members' Interests; No. 3, statements on agriculture, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, on which Senators may share time and which are to conclude no later than 6 p.m., and No. 8, motion No. 10, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_13">Does the Leader of the House agree that there is an urgent need to amend the Order of Business for today to provide for statements by the Minister for Transport concerning the railways? While I acknowledge that there is an Adjournment matter in the name of Senator Mansergh, that is not sufficient. All parties and groupings in the House should be able to put questions and express points of view to the Minister today when a very important meeting of the CIE board is taking place. The Leader is well aware of this issue as she was the one, when Minister, who initiated the expert report on the future of rail services. We have a crazy situation where passenger and freight lines could be lost at a time when we need to build up capacity on the rail system. I urgently ask the Leader to provide time by amending the Order of Business to allow all groupings and Members to contribute to the debate on this important issue and ensure the Minister for Transport comes to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I also ask the Leader to provide time tomorrow to debate a second matter. We do not have a hectic schedule either today or tomorrow as there is a dearth of legislative measures from the Government. Therefore, we can have these debates. Will the Leader provide time tomorrow for the Minister for Finance to come to the House and respond publicly to the highly critical report published by the Ombudsman about the Revenue Commissioners? Substantial amounts of money were not given by them to widows, among others, and we must have a response from the Government. Does it plan to introduce legislation? What is the legal position? The Ombudsman believes the Revenue Commissioners have the discretion to pay back this money which is owed, but this has not been done because of the bureaucratic mindset of some of our public institutions. There is an urgent need to debate this serious matter. Tomorrow will provide us with the opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we seek a statement from the Minister for Transport on the issue of the railways.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I want to raise two issues. The first is that in the course of the last week the new penalty points system for motoring offences was introduced. The House should ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to express his outrage at the further exploitation of drivers with the announcement of one insurance company, Axa, that it will increase the cost of insurance on the basis of penalty points. No one would object if the company also decreased them by the same degree for drivers in the opposite position. The penalty points system is meant to lead to safer roads and, as a consequence, lower insurance premia. My outrage is shared by all Senators. We should make it clear to the companies concerned that this is unacceptable. They should be named and shamed for taking further advantage of hard pressed drivers. Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, whichever is appropriate, to do that?</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The issue raised by Senator Hayes is urgent. I wrote to the Cathaoirleach on this matter this morning, under the terms of Standing Order 29. Although I fully support Senator Hayes, I will not second his proposal because I understand the Cathaoirleach will allow me to come back on this issue in about an hour. I presume that in dealing with this as an urgent matter, as contemplated by the Standing Order, the Cathaoirleach will allow debate.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_21">The putting of thousands of tons of freight on overcrowded Irish roads should be resisted by all parties and by people all over the country. I ask the Cathaoirleach to take a brave stand on the issue so that the people in the House can express their views before the CIE board comes to a decision. I look forward to making that case in an hour and hope the Cathaoirleach will allow a full debate. Perhaps the Leader could confirm that and save us putting the Order of Business to a vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">Since I do not believe in discrimination on age grounds I am quite happy to defer to the senior citizens behind me on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">I support Senator Hayes on the issue of the report of the Ombudsman. The delays by the Revenue contrast with the Taoiseach's attitude in the Dáil yesterday to the question of tax exiles who take large sums of money out of the State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_12">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_26">Is the Senator saying there should be debate?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_27">No. Senator Hayes did not move an amendment to the Order of Business on the issue of the Ombudsman. He asked the Leader about it. I leave the rail issue to my colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I ask the Leader for debate on a number of issues while there is not huge pressure of business. The first issue is that of privatisation on which the Leader is a national authority. The recent success of the ESB in America contrasts spectacularly with the abysmal failure of Eircom since privatisation. I hope ideological issues will not result in our having an extraordinarily successful State company privatised and ending up doing the kind of thing Eircom is doing to its customers. For example, Eircom has no longer a public office in the second city of the State. I invite the Leader to have a debate on the issue of privatisation of public services and utilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I also ask the Leader for a debate on the issue of race and immigration. Many of us are concerned that on the Fianna Fáil benches it is all right to use race and immigration as an issue to get oneself elected. The chairman of the Committee of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources did so during the election and he was rewarded by being made chair of a committee. That is not the spirit in which many of us contested the election. We said we would not bring race or immigration into it. To reward the spectacular abuser of the issue with the chairmanship of a prestigious committee is an offence to those of us who kept our mouths shut. It is an offence particularly to members of Fianna Fáil in my constituency who had the courage to keep their mouths shut when their colleague was behaving disgracefully. We need a debate—</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_31">On the issue of race and immigration, we not only have an input but an obligation and a responsibility. I would like for us to debate the issues of race, immigration and attitudes to it within and without politics. It badly needs to be restated that the rest of us do not approve and reward such behaviour.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">The Order of Business is abysmally thin. A major topic has been awaiting debate in the House, namely, the interim report of the Flood tribunal, which is a report to the House. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the House commence its business today with a debate on the report of the Flood tribunal.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">Will the Leader provide for an emergency debate on the discussion in the United Nations between our permanent representative and those of other countries on the resolution relating to Iraq? The position is serious and the Seanad must be either relevant or redundant. It must debate the issues that are most important in the world. We must give space and an opportunity to Hans Blix, the UN chief weapons inspector, to carry out his duties in Iraq to discover the truth and not just the propaganda perpetrated about the situation in Iraq. The House should be concerned about the unprovoked attack in Yemen, an independent republic—</p>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs should come to the House to outline the exact position.</p>

        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_40">I second the amendment moved by the leader of the Fine Gael group, Senator Brian Hayes, on rail freight.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I support the remarks of the same Senator and others on the report of the Ombudsman. Three issues are involved. One is the flagrant abuse by the Revenue Commissioners in the manner in which they handled the tax affairs of two widows. Another is that an unfortunate precedent has been set in that this is the first time an institution of the State has refused to implement a recommendation of the Ombudsman. This is a very negative development and it is critical that we deal with the issue immediately. A further issue is the statement by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have the statutory powers. If they do not, this House is the place to amend the legislation to give them the required power to allow them treat people equally where taxes are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">An issue raised in the Dáil yesterday is the urgent need to amend the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal. I attended it yesterday and it is obvious that there is an urgent need to amend its terms of reference. This House and the other House are the places in which it must be done. The Taoiseach said yesterday he would not accede to the pleas from the Leader of the Labour Party to amend the terms of reference to suit one person. This does not involve just one person. The legal team representing the McBreartys represent 43 people, namely, the McBreartys, their extended family and their staff. There is an urgent need to amend the terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">We urgently need a debate on the public finances. We have tabled a Private Members' motion, but yesterday came the startling news that there is a shortfall of €1 billion in income tax revenue, apart from corporation tax. The public finances are in a state of crisis. The dogs in the street are talking about it, as are the economic correspondents. We need a debate on the public finances as a matter of urgency in Government time.</p>

          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I support my colleague, Senator Leyden, in asking for a debate on Iraq. Certain people in the American government seem determined to have war no matter what we do and as a legislative Chamber we have a duty to debate this. We may not be able to add much to it but we should at least talk about it and express our views freely and openly in front of the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_24">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_45">I join other colleagues who called for a debate on the report of the Ombudsman. It is unique for the Ombudsman to make this kind of report and it is extremely worrying. Even the report's summary says that the Revenue Commissioners failed to meet the standards required by fair or sound administration in their dealing with the 12 complainants covered in this report. The Revenue Commissioners replied at lunchtime by saying exactly as Senator Higgins has said that there is a legislative requirement. They bounced it back at the Oireachtas. However the Ombudsman addresses this report by saying that the basis on which they decided, i.e. that there is no statutory authority to pay compensation, involves a serious misrepresentation of the position. This is a very serious matter which the House should address. The Ombudsman goes on to say that such misrepresentation is a direct and unprecedented challenge to the authority vested in this office by the Oireachtas.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_49">I also support colleagues who have raised the question of the railway network. Two weeks ago, I asked for a debate on transport. Particularly in view of the distinguished presence of the Leader of the House, who was an excellent Minister with responsibility for transport, we should have a comprehensive debate on that topic, including statements from the Minister on the status of the underground.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I ask the Leader to consider giving time to No. 12, which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_51">That Seanad Éireann urgently desires and requests that all paramilitary organisations, North and South, orange and green, loyalist and republican should forthwith disarm, disband and publicly confirm this action.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">It would be relevant to have this either today or tomorrow, because we have had the statement at lunchtime by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, during his meeting here in Dublin that this is a critical element in making progress in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I would welcome a debate on Iraq, but I understand that we will shortly have constituted the foreign affairs committee, on which the Leader of the House will also sit. This will be another very useful forum to discuss the issue of Iraq.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I join Senator O'Toole and others who expressed concern about the imminent decision of Iarnród Éireann in relation to freight. I come from a county that has fought strenuously for employment over a number of years and has succeeded to some modest degree. The first breakthrough was in the mid-1990s with the establishment of the Masonite company. Many Senators who travel on the N4 through Carrick-on-Shannon to Sligo will be familiar with this company that employs more than 300 people. It is the second largest employer in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">I received a letter this morning addressed to John Lynch of Iarnród Éireann, in which there is a threat of the imminent closure of the railhead at Longford. This would result not only in more than 3,000 road movements on to the N4, but would also mean a loss of €500,000 to Iarnród Éireann and all of the subsequent downsizing if there is, as indicated by this letter to Mr. Lynch, a decision to close down freight traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I am as emotional and passionate about this issue as Senator O'Toole, who can rise to the very heights on occasions in this House. While I might not be able to compete with him, I want to convey to you—</p>

          <p eId="para_59">I second Senator Ryan's amendment to the Order of Business seeking a debate on the interim report of the Flood tribunal. Given that a motion of the Seanad and Dáil established the Flood tribunal, it is extraordinary that we have not had an opportunity since the publication of this important report to debate its contents and note the fact that the issues arising are still matters of major concern to the public and us as Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">I support colleagues on the potential closure of railway lines. More Members than Senators O'Toole and Mooney are passionate about this issue. That is the reason we need an urgent, wide-ranging debate on it. It affects many parts of the country, including my own. It is an outrage given today's environmental and economic concerns as well as the issue of balanced regional development that the Government only pays lip service—</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I ask the Leader to make Government time available for a debate on transport. There has been a lot of talk about the decisions being made outside the House today with reference to specific transport issues. However, there is not just a rail element involved. In my constituency there is the matter of aviation policy, given the decision of the European Court of Justice yesterday on bilateral agreements between the European Union and the United States. There is also the issue of ownership of Shannon and Cork Airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">If for no other reason than to give an outlet for the passion on display today we should have a debate at the earliest convenience. I ask the Leader to allocate Government time to this, if possible, in order that we have the fullest and widest debate possible, which would allow the fullest participation of Members on all sides</p>

I also ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to inform the House when he intends to establish the Shannon River Authority. I understand there was a Private Members' motion on this matter some time ago and it must be addressed. Like the Leader, I come from an area where there has been serious flooding in recent months and people are fed up with promises. The last time a committee was set up, but if one wants to delay activity, one sets up a committee. That committee has yielded nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">I also call on the Minister for Health and Children to explain his position regarding the scientific evidence of the fluoridation forum that fluoridation will adversely affect the health of Irish children and adults.

          <p eId="para_71">I also support calls for a debate on the proposed closure of railway lines. A debate on Iraq is also particularly important. Saddam Hussein has oppressed a religious and ethnic minority – the Kurds – in his own country. He has attacked two of his neighbours, Iran to the east and Kuwait to the south. He is possibly the most dangerous leader in the world. I note that he was given 100% support in the recent election. I ask that the House debate the issue of Iraq as a matter of urgency given that international matters are of concern to it.</p>

This week the Chief Fire Officers Association has asked for an immediate response to proposals made last March by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government who promised that within five weeks he would bring proposals for an emergency service and funding authority for fire safety before the Cabinet. To the best of my knowledge nothing has happened. I ask the Leader to ensure the new Minister comes to the House to inform us what has happened to those proposals. This is not a matter that can be delayed.</p>

All of the funds are going into motorways as opposed to regional roads. I look forward to hearing the view of the Progressive Democrats on this issue. Before the general election they had a different point of view in which they advocated that not of all the money should be spent on motorways. I wonder if they can reconcile their statement before the general election with the reality now that they are back in government.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">On the alleged proposed closure of the Rosslare to Limerick line, the closure of that line would put approximately 150,000 to 160,000 tonnes of beet, during the beet season, onto the roads which do not have the capacity to accommodate that satisfactorily.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">The Leader might address the issue of penalty points on which the Minister for Transport should be complimented. It is evident that people are becoming more compliant in regard to speed limits. It would be appropriate, however, if a more realistic view of speed limits was taken, particularly in small villages and built up areas. We see speed limit signs of 30 miles per hour extended two or three kilometres outside villages often for reasons which have nothing to do with the control of the speed of traffic. The Leader might look at that issue in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">On rail transport, it is a shame this Seanad was not sitting prior to the closure of the Sligo to Donegal rail line because it seems we are all in agreement to keep the present rail system. As Senator Dooley said, maybe we should consider reopening that line.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I appreciate the statements made today but before I respond, I wish to comment on the three references to the fact this House does not seem to be particularly busy. Approximately four times each week I inquire whether there is any legislation to be dealt with. There has been only one new Bill since we returned. That was a money Bill about dormant insurance policies. Money Bills must first go to the other House and then they come to this one. The week after next there will be two new Bills. I hope when we sit on Tuesdays those who spoke passionately about these matters will be in the House ready to speak. I noticed that some of the most passionate speakers were Members I had not seen for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Senator Brian Hayes called for a suspension of Standing Orders to hold an emergency debate on transport. The Cathaoirleach will make a decision on the matter. The Senator also called for a debate on the Ombudsman's report which I also regard as serious, particularly, as was raised by another speaker, the disclaimer by one group as against another as to what has caused the difficulties. It is a serious matter which we must address. I will, or I will have my office, speak to the Minister for Finance regarding a debate on the Ombudsman's report. If we make a decision to debate it, somebody must come into the House to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Senator O'Toole referred to insurance. It is commercial opportunism of the rarest kind to latch on to what is a good measure and to use it against people rather than to reduce the premium of people who do not get a point against their name. The Senator mentioned one company in particular. Under Standing Order 29, he also raised the issue of freight and CIE.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Senator Ryan was one of those who said we were not doing very much work in the House. People have requested that various Ministers – such as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Education and Science – appear before the House, and they have. We hope to have the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation here next week. I hope to open up this process so that there is a definite question and answer session at the end of each sitting, enabling Members to request to speak and to ask general questions and get answers. I hope that the week after next, or perhaps even next week, we will meet on Tuesday afternoon and work right through.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Senator Ryan wants a debate on privatisation and a debate on race and racial attitudes. This is a hugely serious issue. You hear people making jokes when you are in company – and I am not referring at all to the leader of the Fine Gael Party. I was witness to one highly racist joke today, but the people present did not see it as such. It is very easy to transgress in this regard and not to think about people and their feelings—</p>

          <p eId="para_105">Senator Ryan wants a debate on the Flood tribunal, as do we all. I am hoping this will be one of the matters we address next week. Senator Leyden raised the issue of Iran and Iraq, about which he is extremely concerned. We all share that concern no matter how pro-American we may be, which most of us are as history binds us. However, this does not blind us to what is going to happen – half a million people could be blithely put to one side in the interests of oil, money and power, all the wrong objectives. The results of the Congressional elections will have hardened the US stance and reinforced the enthusiasm of the current President.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Senator Jim Higgins raised the Ombudsman's report, as did Senator Brain Hayes, and he also wants to amend the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal. It is clear that the McBrearty family are looking for representation and rights with regard to being heard. I know the Taoiseach has responded to this issue and I was seeking his statement earlier today. I hope matters will unfold in a better fashion than at present, and I take the Senator's point and will pass it on to the appropriate office. Senator Higgins also wants a full debate on public finances in Government time.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Senator Norris raised the Ombudsman's report published yesterday and the issue of rail freight. I thank him for the commendation. Senator Norris also proposed a debate on item 12 on the Order Paper, in his name and that of Senator Ross, which seeks the disbandment of all forces of militarism in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Senator Mooney raised the issue of freight traffic, and he made a great contribution on that matter through his speech and through the correspondence he has kindly just showed me, which would have very far-reaching implications for one of the major industries in a particular part of the country if the freight traffic were to be slowed down or stopped. Senator O'Meara requested debates on the Flood tribunal and rail freight. Senator Dooley wants a full debate on transport, incorporating all the responsibilities of that Department, including Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">There is a need for a full debate on transport, but in the light of the fact that the issue of rail freight and the possible closure of lines are giving rise to such huge and very understandable anguish, it would be better to deal with that matter first. If we have a general debate on transport, the closure of rail freight lines will be submerged. Those who are interested in the issue will understand this point. The debate has been asked for in Government time, to which I will give consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Senator Bannon raised the issues of the Flood tribunal report, freight rail lines and the Shannon River Authority, in respect of which I believe the Bill was initiated in this House.</p>

He also raised the question regarding the Real IRA on which I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday give a comprehensive answer in the Dáil. We must pay tribute to the work of Fr. Alex Reid and his role in the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the Flood tribunal report three weeks ago, before it became an issue, and again raised it today. Senator Browne addressed the matters of the penalty points system and road transport which is a separate issue to the possible closure of freight lines and could perhaps form the basis of another debate. He also wants to have the dual mandate issue discussed for which we will need to send for Deputy Healy-Rae.</p>

We will look back on this day with the same incredulity in years to come. I propose that we debate this urgent and sudden matter. It is sudden because it was only announced yesterday that the CIE board would make a decision today on closing railway lines. We must debate it because if lines are closed, it will mean that bringing Esso oil from the North Wall in Dublin to Ballina will put 75 tankers on the road; Guinness kegs will be hauled by road from Dublin to Galway, Ballina, Claremorris and Cork, and 100 extra lorries will work seven days a week to transport the beet crop.

        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_202">I extend my congratulations to the Cathaoirleach on his appointment and all the new Members elected to Seanad Éireann since my last visit here. The Seanad is a fine forum for discussing and promoting legislation and I like to initiate legislation here whenever I get the opportunity. It is a way of getting valuable contributions from Members and allows public debate on measures in order that the legislation is well refined by the time it gets to the Dáil. The Seanad input and public debate are a helpful influence on the legislation. My grá for Seanad Éireann probably emanates from the fact that I was a Member of this House at one time. To reassure those on the agricultural panel, it is not my intention to seek to return here in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">This debate on agriculture and food is timely. We have considerable challenges before us with the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, enlargement of the European Union and the next world trade round. Senators contributions are awaited with interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">When considering the issues facing our agriculture sector, it is worth recalling that agriculture remains more important to Ireland than to most other EU member states. The agri-food sector as a whole accounts for around 9% of GDP and employment and 7% of Irish exports. Because of its very low import content, agri-food contributes about one quarter of our total net foreign earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The Government is committed to the long-term development of agriculture, food and rural development. The core of this policy is to maintain the greatest possible number of family farms, preserve the rural environment as the basis of a thriving rural community and have a competitive agri-business sector that serves the needs of national and international consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Farm incomes are an important barometer of progress and, in that context, the subject of ongoing monitoring and analysis by the CSO, Teagasc, the European Commission and the Department. It is estimated that average income per person employed in agriculture increased by 15% in 2001 and 12% in 2000. The national farm survey published recently by Teagasc shows average family farm income increased by 17% in 2001 to over €15,800. This was in addition to a 22% increase in 2000. In considering the income situation it has also to be borne in mind that 64% of all farm households also have a source of off-farm income.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The increased availability of off-farm employment opportunities in rural areas has contributed to the future viability of many farm families. Because of the increasing importance of non-farm income to farm households, I have established a steering group on farm household income to assess up-to-date and comprehensive data in this area. The Department of Agriculture and Food chairs this group with participation from the CSO, Teagasc and the ESRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Public expenditure by the Department in support of the agri-food sector amounted to €2.7 billion in 2001, of which over 56% comes from the European Union. A record €1,382 million of this was in the form of direct payments to farmers, in the form of cheques in the post, which accounted for 53% of aggregate farm income. Expenditure also includes export refunds. Having produced the products there are export refunds to help exports to third countries. Intervention is available into which an amount of dairy products were put this year because of the difficulties in world dairying. There are also internal aids to support sectoral market prices at critical times. This very high level of public expenditure underlines the continuing commitment of the Government to the agri-food sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">This year I have taken a series of special actions for the benefit of the farming and agriculture sector in recognition of particularly difficult market and weather conditions. These actions included obtaining EU agreement on a number of occasions to significantly strengthen market supports for dairy products when the price of milk and dairy products became difficult during the summer. Because most milk is produced during the summer it was important to get that support up to September. We also secured EU agreement to allow the use of set-aside land for grazing-fodder. Early this summer we had considerable rainfall and wet weather and this measure was important. We negotiated the removal of the Russian county ban on beef exports – six counties had been precluded from exporting beef to Russia and we obtained EU agreement to allow an increase by up to 30% in beef export refunds to assist the beef industry in agreeing contracts for exports to Egypt.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The actions also included obtaining EU agreement to allow an increase of up to 30% in beef export refunds to assist the beef industry in agreeing contracts for exports to Egypt, securing EU approval to have the advance payments under the bovine premium schemes increased from 60% to 80% this year, obtaining EU agreement to make an advance payment of 50% under the arable aid scheme on 16 October, which is one month ahead of the normal payment date, making administrative changes to simplify the rural environment protection scheme, making changes to reduce the paper work for farmers in applying for the 2003 extensification premia, and introducing improvements to the farm assist scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Direct payments to farmers will bring total payments for the calendar year 2002 to considerably more than €1.4 billion. Ambitious targets for payment delivery in the protocol on direct payments to farmers are being met and Ireland's record for timely delivery of payments ranks us ahead of almost all other member states. Our system for delivering payments is one of the most efficient in the EU. We have considerably fewer disallowances in our payments system than other member states. All the data regarding meeting targets and deadlines and the efficiency of payments are available on the European Commission website.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">These measures represent a concerted and proactive response on my part to the difficulties confronting farmers and the agriculture sector this year. I will continue this approach, especially as regards simplification of procedures in line with the commitments in my Department's customer service action plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">On the beef sector, there have been protests in recent weeks concerning the price of beef. I was concerned that the disagreement between suppliers and factories could have given rise to a situation where the sector as a whole might suffer as a result of interruption of supplies of beef to our main markets. Fortunately, this has been avoided and I welcome the fact that slaughterings are continuing as normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the situation, any sector that is subject to ongoing disputes between producers and processors needs to re-examine itself seriously. The time has surely come when producers and processors or farmers and factories should work together in a concerted effort to ensure what is produced is what the market needs and that they avail of every possible outlet.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The day of producing and processing beef without an eye to the eventual market destination is gone. If the market demands a certain quality or age of animal, that is what must be produced. We are 100% self-sufficient in beef with 7.2 million cattle. We have outlets in the United Kingdom and will sell more than 200,000 tonnes there this year. Regrettably, only 25% of that will be on retail outlet shelves, the rest being in the lower end of the market in bulk and catering. That is not where it should go. Cattle more than 30 months old are not needed anymore for different reasons, yet we continue to keep them for longer than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">We must accept the signals from the marketplace and produce what customers and consumers want. In this regard, I am pleased that producers have responded to the additional opportunities in different markets, especially the British market, by moving to finishing cattle earlier. This means those between 24 to 30 months. Anything older than that is not wanted anymore.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The most effective means of transmitting the needs of the market back to farmers is by means of price. If they obtain a better price for their product, they will continue to produce that product. Not only should the pricing system reflect the needs of the market, especially in terms of quality, it should also include a level of transparency and clarity which engenders the full confidence of the suppliers of the primary product.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Some 18 months ago I put a great deal of effort into putting this transparency in place which means every week the prices from different factories are published. That is a degree of transparency and clarity but I want this extended to include the returns from the marketplace. There is no point in factories saying they cannot pay any more than a certain price because farmers do not trust that system. They want transparency and clarity regarding the returns from the marketplace. Whatever business people are in, they need a margin to operate. If farmers receive an improved margin, they will respond to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The beef sector has come through difficult times in recent years and has shown itself to be resilient. The industry should work to ensure that no further risks are taken with valuable markets by interrupting supplies and that markets which have been reopened are not left to be supplied by competitors. If we open markets and they are not availed of, someone else will move in to supply it.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">A classic example is the Egyptian market. Considerable political and diplomatic efforts were made to lift the ban on Irish beef to Egypt. The industry said it needed extra subsidies to get beef to that market and Commissioner Fischler allowed a 30% increase specifically focused on Egypt. Even with that, the industry has not availed of the opportunity and is not supplying the market. Only one consignment has been sent so far. That is regrettable because, if a market is opened up, a medium and long-term view should be taken and product should be supplied to it while ensuring greater competitiveness than others. There is not much point in making political and diplomatic efforts to open markets if it is left to competitors to supply them.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The agriculture sector or the environment in which it operates never remains static. We need to be continually aware of emerging challenges. In this regard, the Government is guided by the agri-food 2010 action plan, which is a comprehensive, long-term strategy for the sector. I had eminent people study the sector for the first decade of the millennium and they produced the plan in 1999 outlining the trends and likely development of agriculture and the agri-food sector for the first decade of this century. This is important because we do not operate in an ad hoc system. We have a medium and long-term strategy, namely, the 2010 action plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The mid-term review of Agenda 2000, enlargement and the World Trade Organisation negotiations loom large. Following the decision by the European Union Heads of Government at the European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October on the budgetary allocations in the enlarged Union, some of the major questions about the future of the common agricultural policy have been resolved satisfactorily. The European Council decided that in the short term, funding for the CAP in existing member states in the period to the end of 2006 will remain as agreed in Berlin under Agenda 2000. The costs of implementing the CAP in the new member states, including the costs of the phasing in of direct payments, will be provided separately as was also envisaged in Agenda 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">In the longer term beyond 2006, the Council agreed that the total annual outlay on market related expenditure and direct payments should not exceed the amount in real terms of the ceiling set for these expenditures for the existing Union for 2006 by the Berlin European Council plus expenditure for the ten new member states. This amounts to a total of €45.3 billion which constitutes the baseline for future years. The Council decided that expenditure in nominal terms over the years 2007 to 2013 should be kept within the baseline, increasing by 1% per annum. This will provide funding of €48.6 billion in 2013. I am confident that, based on current best estimates of expenditure for the years ahead, this level of funding will be sufficient to provide for the costs of the market-related expenditure and direct payments in a Union of 25 member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">In arriving at its conclusions, the European Council achieved a balance between the need to contain expenditure on agriculture with the need to make a fair offer to the new member states. The agreement provides assurances to the net contributor member states that the extension of the CAP to a Union of 25 will not place intolerable burdens on their exchequers and, in the process, provides safeguards for the farmers of the existing member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">In so far as it can be foreseen, budgetary provision for the CAP is now in place until 2013. This gives a great deal of stability, security and confidence for farmers moving forward in that they know the budgetary position and the financial support for farming and agriculture in an enlarged Union are secure. There were concerns about this during the referendum on the Nice treaty. What would pay for enlargement and how could farmers in Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states be brought up to the level of member states? We now have a financial framework up to 2013, which should give security to our farming community in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The decisions of the European Council are stated to be without prejudice to the future decisions on the CAP and the financing of the European Union after 2006; any result following the implementation of the reviews of the Agenda 2000 agreement provided for by the Berlin European Council, and the international commitments which the Union has undertaken, <i>inter alia</i>, in launching the Doha round of WTO negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">As I stated, the European Council decisions on the EU budget were taken without prejudice to the outcome of the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, which is under way. Commissioner Fischler will be presenting detailed proposals in the coming months, as a follow-on to the outline proposals published last July, and seeking decisions on them in the Council in the new year. However, there is now little likelihood that a qualified majority can be obtained for the implementation of any significant change in the CAP before 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">A positive feature of the Brussels summit is that no upper limits have been placed after 2006 on rural development expenditure, which includes agri-environmental programmes such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, forestry and farmer retirement. The Council also emphasised that the needs of farmers living in disadvantaged areas should be safeguarded and multifunctional agriculture maintained in all areas of Europe. This represents a significant commitment by the European Council to protect and enhance the economic and social fabric of Europe's rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I repeat my commitment to the agriculture and food industry that I will not agree to changes to the Agenda 2000 agreement which will impact negatively on them. I have already stated my position clearly to the Council of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The negotiations on EU enlargement are in their final stages and due to conclude at the EU summit in Copenhagen next month. It has now been agreed that ten new member states will join the European Union in 2004. As this coincides with Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the first six months of 2004, this will be the first country to hold the Presidency of the enlarged European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Direct payments will be phased in in the new member states over a ten year period. The first 25% of the level applicable in the Union of 15 will apply in 2004 followed by three increments of 5% in the next three years and, from 2008, by an annual increment of 10%, reaching 100% in 2013. This approach is designed to minimise the economic distortion that would in many cases result from sudden huge increases in income and avoid discouraging the restructuring of agriculture which will be necessary in many of the new member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Decisions remain to be taken on the sensitive issues of quotas and reference periods for the applicant countries. I expect these decisions to be finalised at the Copenhagen summit in December. It is clear that the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations will not create the conditions which will force further CAP reform on the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">As I indicated during the course of the campaign for the ratification of the Nice treaty, funding was provided separately for the costs of enlargement up to 2006. That position has been confirmed by the Heads of Government in Brussels. The decision on the budget post-2006 does not in itself require that further reform be undertaken in relation to market supports or direct payments. On the other hand, the integration of the new member states into a single market of approximately 480 million consumers without tariff or other trade barriers will create a new impetus for growth in the market and provide opportunities for all member states, old and new. Most of the new member states are more dependent on agriculture than we are and I expect will be most useful allies in defending the interests of agriculture within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">A new round of multilateral trade negotiations, including agriculture, was launched at the WTO Doha ministerial conference last November. The outcome of the new round, which will be of immense significance for EU and Irish agriculture, will pose a major challenge. The next WTO round will determine the conditions under which we can continue to export to third countries, the level of market access for our competitors to the EU market and the levels of EU support that can be provided for agriculture. We have particular concerns in relation to the retention of the European Union's system of direct payments and export subsidies. As I have already indicated, direct payments make a substantial contribution to farm incomes in Ireland and, under the current GATT Uruguay Round agreement, are exempt from reductions. My aim will be to ensure the continuation of this exemption into the future. I spoke of direct payments to farmers of €1.4 billion this year. If that is challenged by the WTO, it will have serious implications for Irish farmers and I want to continue the exemption.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">As a major exporter of agricultural produce, we are heavily dependent on export subsidies to remain competitive on world markets. With my French colleague, I managed to ensure the terms of reference for the next round did not prejudge the outcome of the negotiations in terms of the elimination of export refunds as was sought by other WTO member countries. However, I am under no illusion that there is a strong hostility towards the CAP among certain trading groups and that the European Union's position will come under pressure in the difficult negotiations in the new round. While we can take considerable comfort from the outcome of the European Council in Brussels, the challenges to the CAP will continue. I remain determined to protect the gains from Agenda 2000 which represented a very good outcome for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The agri-food sector is a major indigenous industry. I am committed to ensuring a favourable framework for the development of the sector and rural communities into the future and ensuring favourable conditions for the continued presence of high quality Irish produce, both for Irish consumers and on world export markets.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_237">I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address us today. I am delighted he has returned safely from his successful visit to Fairyhill. Not many Members will know where that is, but the Minister can tell them afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Minister mentioned farm incomes in respect of which farmers are getting very angry. He failed to mention that incomes are set to fall by 17% by which amount he said they rose last year. Taking inflation into account, Teagasc advises that they will drop by 20% this year. This is a staggering drop that would be hard for any sector of society to take. This means average family farm income this year will be around €14,000 or about half the average industrial wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Political responsibility for the disastrous fall in incomes rests fairly and squarely with the Minister and the Government. Prices in all the main sectors of beef, lamb, milk and grain are down. Producers are subject to massive political regulation and excessive bureaucracy that is driving many farmers, particularly younger ones, away from the business. They have to put up with cost increases which are beyond the control of most.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">For producing food of the highest quality, farmers are entitled to a decent price that will give them a modest income. That is all they are looking for. A farmer carried out research and found the yield from the average dairy cow will generate €1,800 for a farmer. A similar amount of milk will generate €18,800 for some of the super outlets like McDonalds. There is a huge discrepancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Before the present crisis, approximately 20,000 farmers were earning less than €200 per week. With the present crisis, it is estimated that another 20,000 are in danger of being forced out of farming in the very near future. Under the leadership of the Minister, if a farmer wanted to generate an income on a par with someone on the average industrial wage, he or she would require from his or her enterprise 250 head of beef stock and 165 acres of land, a suckler herd of 90 suckler units, a milk quota of 80,000 gallons, 550 sheep, 600 acres of barley or 400 acres of winter wheat. The average size farm in Ireland is 65 acres. To improve their incomes, farmers require an increase in prices for their produce and an increase in scale and productivity which requires access to more land at more favourable prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The Minister and the Government have stood idly by this and every other autumn as the factories force down the price of cattle by at least €70 per head, while the market remains stable in Britain. Prices have increased on the Continent. We have heard umpteen times that there is no cartel in the beef factories. It must be an extraordinary coincidence that on the same morning every week the factories quote lists for the price of cattle that read the same. For God's sake, who is codding whom?</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Then we have the disgraceful behaviour of the Competition Authority which stated in response to farmers' complaints that it was understaffed and would take 12 months to reply. Yet on a whim after a phone call it could raid the homes of private individuals, the unpaid representatives of the farming community who are doing their best to ensure the survival of the farming sector. The Minister and the Tánaiste have a lot of questions to answer in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Minister has failed, as he said himself, to get produce into the Egyptian market. Nothing has happened there, in Saudi Arabia, in the Gulf States and the Middle East, in Indonesia or in South Africa. We can name all the places where nothing is happening. Will we have to set up some new derby like the Kentucky Derby to get things moving in these places?</p>
          <p eId="para_245">In Ireland the dead trade depends to a large extent on the live trade. Live exports play a crucial role in maintaining cattle price competition and in maintaining adequate market outlets for Irish producers. Beef imports from South America have inflicted severe damage on both our home market and on the UK market. It is totally unacceptable that Irish producers have to conform to the highest international standards of beef safety and traceability, animal welfare and environmental standards while imports are allowed into the EU from countries which have very lax traceability standards. Food imports now account for a significant share of the home market. For example, there is no traceability with 33% of poultry, including chicken from Thailand. Elements of the Irish catering trade favour cheap imported produce and consumers then think they are eating Irish goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Regarding the schemes being put in place by the Government, we are told environmentally friendly farming is the way forward, particularly in the European market. Protection of the environment is of the utmost importance but here the Government has made a mess of REPS II. That is an important scheme which meets the social, environmental and income needs of farmers. It is anticipated that 70,000 farmers will join the REPS II and if they do it will automatically satisfy EU water quality requirements. However, the number in REPS II today is 10,000 fewer than when REPS I ceased two years ago. Why are farmers not joining? Because the payment rates are simply too low and there are too many restrictions. The scheme is too complex and bureaucratic and investment costs are too high. The scheme must be improved so that €250 per hectare is paid and the limit is raised from 40 hectares to 60 acres, or from 100 acres to 150 acres. Those on less than 40 hectares should get an increase from €6,000 at present to €10,000. The Minister has taken €50 million out of REPS II this year. That implies the uptake of the scheme has been deliberately held back and postponing the review of the scheme to 2003 means that any proposal to the European Commission will not be passed for implementation until 2004. Farmers therefore receive the current rate, which is too low, and that is why they are not joining the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Farm waste management is another very important issue for farmers and the environment. Over 4,000 farmers now participate in the scheme but that is significantly lower than anticipated under the National Development Plan. The Book of Estimates for 2002 allocated €37 million to this but it is estimated that only €10 million has been spent under the scheme. No wonder the Minister for Finance, who is a gambler himself, thinks Deputy Walsh is the best man for agriculture – he is saving the most money for the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Grants for the control of farmyard pollution should be made available to every farmer. This is another example of bureaucracy strangling a scheme, because the facts speak for themselves: 800 farmers or 20% of those who apply for a grant have been refused. Again, the income limit for this scheme should be abolished and investment should be increased from €50,000 to €75,000. Farmers should get the same level of grant from the EU as municipal authorities get to cater for their sewerage problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The Minister has failed to put the sheep tagging issue to bed; instead he has increased the layers of bureaucracy. One tag – a flock or herd tag – in one ear of the animal is acceptable to the Commission and is applied in Europe. What does our Minister want? Not only does he want one tag in one ear, he wants several tags in both ears. He knows that nowadays farmers must be qualified auditors as well as farmers to survive this system. This must be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">There have been savage ewe premium cuts, another example of the Minister's sustained panic attack on the agriculture sector. His dismal performance at the Luxembourg talks last summer, where he gave away 50,000 premium quota, means farmers now face penalties on applications over 50 units this winter, the time they can least afford it. Many farmers received 80% advance payments before the Nice referendum, as the Minister said, but they received destocking letters afterwards which upset them further. Many more have received no payment at all this year. Surely every farmer is entitled to advance payments on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Unlike the Minister, these farmers are not going away. They should not be penalised for technical or other reasons, such as a strike or work to rule in the public service unions. Failure to pay farmers on time and excessive penalties are driving farmers out of business and frightening young people away from farming. We face difficult CAP reform proposals and Commissioner Fischler has proposed area based payments to replace premium payments. The EU revelation that less than 1% of the total budget is spent on agriculture makes Commissioner Fischler's demands for more cuts sound hollow.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I have referred to a number of schemes but there are many others which are not working and to which I could allude. I cannot do so because of time constraints but I will refer to one more, the farm retirement scheme. According to this scheme 45% of farmers are over 55. Over half of that 45% is over 60, so this scheme needs reform. The farmers have lost confidence in the Minister and are going directly to Brussels. That is an indication that the Minister should consider availing of the farm retirement scheme himself as farmers have lost confidence in him. They need a new, energetic and imaginative approach as there is no long-term plan for agriculture from the Government, which is drifting from one crisis to another. By failing to plan it has planned to fail. The Minister should consider the retirement scheme and I wish him good luck with it.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterCallanan" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_253">I am pleased Deputy Walsh was reappointed as Minister for Agriculture and Food, as were most people. There were one or two exceptions but that is to be expected. I am particularly glad the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has been assigned to this Department. He brings expertise and knowledge to the post and we appreciate his presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I welcome the success of the Taoiseach at the recent European Council in having direct income support payments for farmers guaranteed for a further seven years beyond 2006 to 2013. This has major positive implications for the mid-term review of the CAP which is currently being discussed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers. The Minister outlined here today his commitment to ensuring the continuing development and sustainability of agriculture for farmers both in this country and in Europe would be upheld. This will strengthen the Minister's hand in the negotiations. He has already indicated that he will not tolerate the wholesale changes proposed by Commissioner Fischler. We are all very appreciative of both the Taoiseach's and the Minister's staunch defence of Irish farmers' interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The importance of early payments and direct income supports is clearly evident from the fact that they amount to in excess of €1.3 billion annually. As the Minister said, they account for 53% of farm income. In reply to Senator Coonan, in 2001 Tipperary received in excess of £90 million from EU aid payments. That the Minister and his Department ensured that €650 million of these payments were made within a week of the start of the EU financial year on 16 October is something farmers greatly appreciate.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">It goes without saying that the future of farming will depend on the influx of new entrants into the sector. The agri-food 2010 plan of action contained recommendations that should be introduced to encourage land mobility and early transfer. Currently, 20% of farm land is farmed by holders aged over 65 years. There are a number of tax incentives which aim to reduce the cost of farm transfers. The new scheme of early retirement allows for participation by part-time farmers to transfer land to younger farmers and to receive land transfers themselves. These changes make the scheme more attractive to both parties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Younger farmers are also benefiting from the increased training and educational opportunities available. Prospective full-time commercial farmers are currently being encouraged to undertake the national certificate in agriculture programme and to follow on to the proposed national diploma in agriculture. There has been an increased number of students attending UCD and the agricultural colleges both last year and this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The mainstreaming of the new agricultural and horticultural courses into the CAO system will also provide highly trained entrants into these sectors. It is envisaged that the increased educational profile of Irish farmers will enable them to better compete on the world market. There has also been concrete support available under the agri-food 2010 plan to encourage productive farm investment. All these schemes of public funding have been available to both full and part-time farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Minister and the Ministers of State, Deputies Treacy and Aylward, are committed to the future of farming, a future which provides full and part-time farmers with every available option to achieve a viable level of farm household income and to have a sustainable future in agriculture. However, if we are to bring about a positive vision of the agri-food 2010 report, there must be significant action by all players in the industry, from the producers to processors and exporters. When the report was launched, the Minister stated that if appropriate action was not taken in the short term, then more painful changes would be forced on us in the long term. The clock is still ticking. I urge all Members to consider what they can do to contribute to the competitive position of the Irish agri-food sector. The Government's role has been to provide a sustainable environment and a support framework. The extent to which the agri-food 2010 plan of action has been implemented provides a positive testimony to our success in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The beef industry is an "up and down" industry but it is a substantial national industry. Unless farmers, processors and exporters come together to determine a programme which will be successful for all concerned, this country will be without a beef industry in the future. The drop in prices over the past few weeks is unacceptable. Farmers have been forced to take action and markets which were not easily won are being put at risk. Unless the difficulties are faced, not farmers, processors or exporters will be in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Minister has shown unrelenting commitment to the highest standards of food safety since he first came to the Department in 1987. Food safety is a non-negotiable element of the food production system. There can be no compromises in this regard. New food safety regulations being adopted at national and EU levels will strengthen existing controls. There is now a modern livestock traceability system for cattle in place. This has been extended to sheep and pigs. Under new legislation adopted by the EU earlier this year, traceability systems will have to be in place for all food and feed products by 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Senator Coonan referred to imports from non-EU countries. We need a structure within the EU that will keep a record of such imports and ensure an enforcement policy. We are aware of imports of doubtful origin and quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">With reference to the rural environment protection scheme I welcome the Minister's recently announced consultative process which will make comprehensive proposals to the EU Commission in 2003. This process will give stakeholder groups a chance to contribute to the formulation of these proposals. Consultation should be wide ranging and cover all aspects of the scheme, including the structure of REPS, individual measures, payment rates and controls and sanctions. REPS has so far delivered over €1 billion to Irish farmers. It is important that the proposals developed from the consultative process should ensure the continuation of this significant funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Significant progress has also been achieved within the North-South Ministerial Council framework, particularly in relation to an all-island animal health strategy. At its meeting in September the North-South Ministerial Council endorsed a paper setting out the scope of convergence of animal health policy North and South and agreed that officials should seek to finalise discussions with the UK authorities prior to final agreement of the strategy. The detailed issues are currently being dealt with in the various policy working groups in accordance with the timetable set out in the paper. The council also initiated discussions to identify areas for public co-operation in plant health, pesticides, diagnostics and research co-operation. It has also agreed to explore the establishment of a plant health risk assessment panel. Discussions were also initiated on identifying new areas for co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">In September the council agreed that under EU matters, food labelling and trade issues would be examined. Organic farming and agricultural training are to be submitted to the working groups. I welcome those initiatives. In less than 15 minutes we are meeting members of the Northern Assembly at our party meeting which I will chair. I hope to be forgiven if I leave the Chamber as soon as I have finished my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I wish to make a comment on the recent controversy surrounding the storage by the Department of Agriculture and Food of the carcasses of BSE-positive animals in County Tipperary. I never cease to be amazed at the capacity of certain sections of the media and others to distort facts on a subject of this importance. There is no foundation whatsoever for the suggestion that the Department of Agriculture and Food breached environmental laws in relation to the disposal of BSE positive carcases. The Department's handling of all aspects of BSE fully accords with EU and national legislation. It is the subject of ongoing scrutiny by various independent bodies such as the EU Food and Veterinary Office, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and others and has been recognised time and time again as comprehensive, rigorous and responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The treatment of BSE positive material is specifically dealt with in EU veterinary legislation. Under such legislation, the only approved means of disposal of such material are burial or incineration. We all know the Department discontinued the practice of burial of BSE carcases in late 2000 and in the absence of any suitable incineration facility within the State, it has been necessary to make interim storage arrangements pending the resolution of the problem of ultimate disposal of carcases. Since November 2000 such carcases have been frozen and stored in a secure and dedicated cold store owned by the Department and located in Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">On the cereal sector in which I have some interest, the persistent wet weather in the first half of the year made growing and harvesting somewhat difficult but we survived. Yields are well down and I hope there will be a few bob in the kitty for some of us. Total production was close to the average of 2 million tonnes mainly due to an increase in the area under winter wheat. The fruit and vegetable sector also suffered severe losses and I ask the Department and the Minister to pay particular attention to it. To alleviate the cash flow problems of cereal farmers, I am glad the Minister secured approval from the EU to bring forward 50% of the area aid payments by one month. He also increased the rate of voluntary set aside from next year so that farmers may set aside up to 40% of their land if they so wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I welcome the forthright, dedicated and committed statement by the Minister. The Minister and the Ministers of State, Deputies Treacy and Aylward, together with Department officials will make a good team. They have secured the position of agriculture in Ireland under sometimes difficult circumstances and it is only right that we express our appreciation of all concerned.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_270">I express my gratitude to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, my constituency colleague and a former Member of this House, for taking time out of his busy schedule to be with us this afternoon. Unfortunately, I do not agree with much of what he said on this matter, or on many matters relating to the threat to this important part of the fabric of rural life.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">On the beef dispute, we have heard some flattering statements about egotistic politicians but the lack of intervention in the beef dispute was comical. On the recent beef protests, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I was concerned that the disagreement between suppliers and factories could have given rise to a situation where the sector as a whole might suffer as a result of interruption of supplies of beef to our main markets. Fortunately, this has been avoided and I welcome the fact that slaughterings are continuing as normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Slaughterings are continuing as normal but it is not because the Minister, the Ministers of State or the Taoiseach made a reasonable effort to prevent the dispute from taking place or to prevent it from continuing for weeks. The industry was under enough pressure and for the Government to sit idly by and to wait for a dispute of that magnitude to be resolved or for a mysterious intervention by a fairy godmother was unbelievable given the current economic climate in which many sectors find themselves, not least the farming community. Where there is potential for such a dispute in any area of agriculture, there should be a mechanism in place to appoint a conciliator or a facilitator to resolve it with as little interruption to the industry as possible and to bring all areas of agriculture back to the grindstone. The best interests of agriculture must be maintained by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I refer to the mid-term review of CAP. Recently, the Nice treaty received a resounding endorsement from the people. I was a strong exponent of a "Yes" vote in the Nice treaty. One of the implications of a "No" vote would have been to send the Minister for Agriculture and Food to Brussels with his two hands tied behind his back. Thankfully, that did not happen because the country accepted enlargement. The Minister is now in a position of strength and can go to Brussels to negotiate the best possible package for the farming community. The word "review" is probably not the best word to use in regard to CAP. The word "reform" was probably what the Commission had in mind when it came to tinkering with the details of the Agenda 2000 agreement signed in 1999. This is probably one of the main criticisms of the recent announcement and one with which I sympathise.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">As we all know, the Agenda 2000 agreement was designed to run until 2006 but it seems it is being thrown out the window without any consultation with political or farming representatives. The Fischler announcement had long been flagged as a review of Agenda 2000 which one might have assumed would be an assessment of the progress of the implementation of the Berlin agreement and its effects on the agriculture industry in member states. Instead, it seems Franz Fischler seems intent on terminating Agenda 2000, throwing out what remains to be implemented in that agreement and proceeding to reform CAP overnight. I sympathise with the question being raised by many farm leaders recently. They asked if the European Commission can be trusted in relation to the implementation of agreements signed by Agriculture Ministers as with that in Berlin in 1999. Whatever about not being able to trust the Commission in the future, the confidence of Irish farmers in the EU has been severely dented by the nature of the announcement by the Commissioner, Franz Fischler.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">As was rightly pointed out, another important development in Irish farming is the concentration on farm training. At present in Irish farming, there are talented, intelligent and young farmers. However, the manner in which they are treated at times by this Government is appalling. The recent attempt by the Government to buy votes in the Nice treaty by sending out badly needed money during the week of the referendum offends people's intellect and sense of honour. I represent a constituency which is predominantly agricultural and I know people voted "No" because of that. It is not a good idea to use these types of ploys in a referendum, an election or a by-election as it insults the integrity, common sense and intellect of many people involved in farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Senator Callanan made a far-reaching contribution on many matters. I profoundly disagree with his cúpla focal on BSE-infected material housed in Tipperary which was not classified as hazardous and transported safely. The Labour Party has called for a comprehensive statement from the Minister to explain why specified risk material from slaughtered cattle, some of which may have contained BSE, had not been classified by the Department as hazardous waste. Specified risk material, known as SRM, includes material such spinal cords, tonsils and skulls which are removed from all slaughtered cattle over 12 months old before they are ready for consumption. This is done to reduce the risk of Creutzfelt-Jakob disease being contracted by humans. The SRM is removed and stored in a large warehouse in County Tipperary to await transportation abroad for incineration. The SRM stored in Tipperary could contain BSE-infected material, and therefore become a risk to human health. EU directives and the Waste Management Act, 1996, require that such material be classified as hazardous waste, but this was not done in this case. That is quite worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Given the increasing concerns about the BSE incidence and the fact that consumer confidence has been shaken by the discovery of BSE in three cows born after 1997, when the ban on meat and bonemeal was imposed, the situation is fundamentally unacceptable. It has led to An Taisce taking the issue to Europe in the wake of a recent "Prime Time" programme to seek that the material housed in Tipperary be classified immediately as hazardous.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">This year in particular was an extraordinarily bad one for farmers. Senator Noel Coonan rightly points out that farmers' incomes next year will be significantly depleted, as opposed to the paltry increases they had in 2000 and 2001. There is an onus on this Government to ensure that farming is safeguarded and that as many young people as possible can be encouraged to undertake careers in farming. The incentives available in many other areas of professional occupation increasingly lure young people from the land, and that is a very sad development in Irish society. At one time, in any rural area the vast majority of people depended in some way or other on an agriculture-based income. A large part of the income of the dwindling number of farmers left on the land is from direct payments, not from farming activity itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I urge the Minister to take cognisance of the fact that young farmers are no longer considering careers in farming. I urge him to look at the appalling vista in Irish agriculture and to ensure as far as he can that the schemes available for young farmers are safeguarded, that the funding which is allowed for such schemes is kept to an optimum. I hope when the Minister returns from Brussels following successful CAP negotiations, he will have a package that is worthwhile for Irish farmers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_281">We are required to declare an interest at the outset of these debates, so I declare my interest as a tillage farmer in County Kildare. I used to farm beef until I saw the light of day and was no longer financially able to sustain a beef enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The industry is facing several huge challenges. There is the challenge of enlargement, and how we are going to deal with countries where a significant proportion of the population is engaged in agriculture. There are the issues of how we are to fund that enlargement, environmental protection and how farming can be sustainable within that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I attended a conference in Germany last week about sustainability which demonstrated how far the thinking in mainland Europe has gone beyond our thinking as to how farming and the environment must live together. It is significant that they are now considering co-operatives, not just producer co-operatives but consumer and producer co-operatives, to try to contain production within a region and to avoid contributing to greenhouse gas emissions by transporting goods over long distances.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Notwithstanding all those challenges, the most immediate and serious challenge facing us is the new round of WTO negotiations. Given the way the Minister, Deputy Walsh, dealt with the Uruguay round, how he dealt with foot and mouth and how he has dealt with the on-going debate over potential change of the Common Agricultural Policy, I have every confidence that he, his Minister of State and the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food can effectively meet those challenges so that the industry can continue to survive and prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">As a practising farmer, I believe there has been an extended whinge over a considerable time which has been entirely detrimental to farming putting its case at national level. It has got to the point now that when farmers complain, the general public shrug and say "That is the farmers again." When there are genuine complaints, as there were earlier this year with regard to the appalling weather, the general public just do not listen anymore. When there are genuine complaints about the returns to farming, the general public do not listen anymore because they have been fed on a diet of whingeing even when times were good. There is a significant political lesson there for farming organisations and it is one they should take to heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I regard enlargement as an opportunity for us on several fronts. Facing into the serious challenges of the WTO round and the shaping of the new Common Agricultural Policy, we now at last will have allies who speak the same language as we do. Rather than having to rely on the French to buttress us, or perhaps at times the Mediterranean countries who have different interests, we will now have a large bloc of people within the European political establishment who understand and sympathise with the arguments we have been making over the years. That is a significant advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">There is a great fear about what will happen to our productive industry when we are faced with low-cost competition from Poland, the Czech Republic and other central and eastern European states. These fears, while understandable, are not sustainable. When we joined the European Community, it was widely believed that the Mediterranean countries would be the main driving force of production in both horticulture and agriculture because of their low cost base. It did not turn out like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">If quality was important then, it is even more important now. We have the capacity to deliver quality to the market that is unmatched worldwide, with the possible exception of New Zealand. We have that capacity and it is up to us to market that quality, to market the perception of this country as a place where quality food comes from. It is wrong to suggest that we should lower ourselves to standards which are far inferior to ours in order to compete. The opposite is the case. We have to maintain the standards we have established.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">A classic example is the matter of beef hormones. There were long debates on this issue in this House, and one of the contributors was Professor Tom Raftery, an expert in the area. It was incontrovertible from a scientific point of view that anabolic steroids were not harmful to human health when used properly on beef animals – and I am not including angeldust in that category, which is a different matter. People then said that the American farmers are using these steroids so we should also be able to use them. What this fails to recognise is the primacy of the consumer. If European consumers decide that they want beef without hormones that is the end of the argument; the science does not enter into it. Unfortunately, the legacy left by intervention over so many years is to make us avoid that reality and to assume that we could produce for a market and that it was up to the market to clear the product. There was no mention of the consumer. It is a hangover that is still with us and is causing problems in terms of selling our products on international markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">There are huge opportunities for Irish agri-business in an enlarged market. I was in America quite recently and saw what is being done there by Irish agri-business in a very hostile environment. We have that capacity within our leading co-ops and food PLCs to match the very best in the world and to beat them. We need to have a little more confidence in our capacity to do that and we should talk it up a bit more than we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">In terms of the industy's capacity to respond to the challenges, there are two essential elements that are being neglected. These are research and agricultural advice. We are not keeping pace in our thinking about what we need to do to meet these challenges and evolve different ways of thinking and producing. In light of the fact that agricultural incomes are unquestionably falling, we need to see things in terms of a global rural society.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">If I can live on my home farm and make a living from it without having to move to a city, that is an advance. It is appropriate that farm people, like others, should aspire to higher living standards. There seems to be a belief that, because one lives in a rural area and farms, one should not have the same expectations of success for oneself or one's children as city people have. This is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Is it any wonder that there is a flight from the land to the cities by young people when they have sat at breakfast tables for years and heard their parent complain about how terrible life is on the land? My son has just completed a PhD in agriculture and he works for the Department of Agriculture. If he had been subjected to this constant battering, it would not have been surprising if he turned his back and walked away. People who wish their children to stay on the land have a responsibility at least to make it an encouraging career for their children. We must rethink the model.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The bureaucracy of the agricultural system is a serious issue. It is impossible to read some of the forms. It is a pity a journalist does not write some of them so that people can understand them. On two occasions, I had queries in relation to arable area aid on my own farm which were unnecessary and should not have been made. The Department of Agriculture and Food made the mistake. Regarding payments being described as bribery for a "Yes" vote in the referendum on the Nice treaty, as far as I can recall, my payment for arable area aid arrived at the same time as it did last year. The cheque arrived on 16 October and was dated 16 October. I was paid on time and I would have been upset had I not been.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">There is a facile suggestion that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is responsible for intervening in a wrangle between farmers and the meat factories – that is not the way the market works. The Minister is correct to insist on a degree of liaison and transparency with regard to how prices are arrived at. The weekly monitoring of prices has been a help but we do not need to re-invent the wheel. I visited France 25 years ago where a system for grain prices based on accountancy principles derived from the books of grain co-operatives was in place, along with a system of sharing profit and, in the event of pain, sharing the loss. There are models which are not of the confrontational nature such as we see at present where crude market forces operate alone. I question how the Minister can intervene helpfully with regard to restraining those market forces other than by ensuring that prices are transparent and available and people know exactly what the product is making.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I congratulate the Minister on what he has achieved to date with the Council of Europe and I am confident that the successes achieved in the past on the Uruguay round and other negotiations at European level can be repeated. To be fair to the Minister, he did not do what one of his predecessors on the other side of the House did. I still have the press release – issued on the morning of a general election – stating that the Egyptian market had been opened when it had not. We can all point fingers but it is not useful to how the industry advances and progresses. I wish the Minister, his colleagues and everyone in his Department well in the challenges ahead and I am confident they will face them to the benefit of Irish agriculture and the country as a whole.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am happy to speak on this matter, although I will find myself speaking more on food than agriculture. I had the honour of being part of the expert group 10 years ago which was asked to decide on the future of the food business in Ireland. I found myself arguing a particular case – which I did not win – which was that the Department of Food should be in the hands of any Minister other than the Minister for Agriculture. I felt it should have been within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or anywhere else because there is a strong case to be made for the consumers as well as the farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I disagree with Senator Dardis and some others who spoke because I want to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the squalid little deal on agriculture entered into between France and Germany at the last European Council and fully colluded in by this Government. The net effect of this cosy little arrangement is to put the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy off the agenda for the foreseeable future. I am proud to be Irish and a European citizen and I am well known around the world as a champion of the Irish food industry, but I cringe every time I hear of a new refusal by Europe to face up to realties in regard to the CAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">For as long as we leave the CAP unreformed, we are trying to live in the past. In its present form, the policy is both hugely wasteful and highly inefficient, even in reaching its own declared objectives. It penalises the majority of Europeans at the expense of a small minority. Even worse, it penalises the peoples of the developing world by distorting the world marketplace for their agricultural goods. In Ireland, successive Governments have taken precisely the wrong attitude towards this cancer in the European project. We did not invent it – it was there when we joined – but instead of recognising it for the uneconomic, unfair and ultimately unsustainable monster that it was, we fell on it like manna from heaven.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">As a predominantly agricultural country, we would have had immense moral authority if we had chosen instead to lead the way out of the quagmire our partners had created for themselves before we joined. Unlike Britain, which has clear vested interests in this matter, no one would have questioned our bona fides if we had put a hand up and told the truth. That truth, which has been staring us in the face for 30 years, is that the CAP cannot survive as a permanent part of a united Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">We need to face up to this and to debate it but the debate is unheard. Some of what I have to say is anathema to some Members who have spoken. Instead of planning for life after CAP, we decided to stick out heads in the sand and pretend we could drag out the good times forever. We have persisted in this doomed policy at enormous cost. First, in absolute terms, the agricultural policy swallows up the lion's share of the EU budget year after year. Valery Giscard d'Estaing wants us to change the name of the EU yet again. If we named it after where the money goes, maybe we should call it "The Union of European Farmers". For an entity with the aspirations of the European Union to spend 75% of its entire annual budget on farm supports shows a peculiar sense of priorities indeed. That is, however, not the nub of my objection to the policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I believe in supporting farms and farmers. I believe in developing the food industry in Ireland and across Europe and helping people to preserve the rural way of life. In particular, I believe in helping people in rural areas find new ways beyond agriculture of developing the economic potential in those areas. I am the first to admit that these measures will cost the broad mass of citizens an arm and a leg but what I will not admit is that the CAP is the right way to go about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Two categories of people are short-changed by the Common Agricultural Policy. The first category is the ordinary customers, the broad mass of the nearly half a billion people the European Union will soon embrace through enlargement. They must pay twice for the Common Agricultural Policy and the smallest part of what they pay is through the taxes that fund the European budget but the most important burden on them is the higher prices they pay every day when they go out to buy their food. Every time they buy food, week in and week out, they pay more than they should have to pay. The prices they pay are determined by the market laws of supply and demand. These prices are totally artificial and are determined by the need to use the market to deliver a certain level of support to farmers throughout the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Instead of supporting farmers directly, we support them mainly through a price support system that is totally inappropriate and it is obvious to any independent economist that this system does not benefit anybody. It certainly does not benefit the consumers who buy the food. It does not benefit farmers either because, despite what it may have done in the past, the Common Agricultural Policy fails to provide a proper living to most European farmers. We heard about some aspects of that today. Falling incomes have driven more and more people off the land – referred to my many speakers – and instead have encouraged large scale, more intensive farming that produces commodities of often dubious quality. I say that as somebody who knows the difficulty involved in getting top quality food on occasions. A total of 80% of all EU subsidies go to 20% of farmers, in other words, they go to the big farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The CAP encourages the wasteful over-production of food. It is a peculiar irony that a system originally designed to make Europe self-sufficient in food is now characterised, more than anything else, by the fact that it results in too much food being produced year after year. This is where the other mass of people who are short-changed by the CAP come in – the people of the developing world. The negative effect of the CAP, and the European trade policy that springs directly from it, is much greater for them than it is even for the people of Europe. On the one hand, we keep the produce from the developing world out of our own market and, on the other, we undermine prices for them elsewhere in the world by flooding other markets with all our surpluses at uneconomic prices. As a result, those people cannot get into those markets and compete. Meanwhile, we beat our breasts about the need to help developing countries as long as that help is delivered in the least suitable way in the form of large gifts or grants of cash. We give them with one hand while using the other to prevent them trading in the only things they have to trade. If we traded fairly, we could keep all our aid and the developing world would still be better off.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">What we are doing is not only bad economics, it is a morally rotten way to behave. It is an amazing way for a country like Ireland to behave with all our traditions and values. If we persist in behaving that way, we cannot hope, as Europeans, to gain the influence and respect we seek in the rest of the world. From the viewpoint of those in the developing world, they see the two great powerhouses of wealth – the United States and Europe – lined up against them. Both powerhouses undermine the developing world by distorting food markets and subsidising farm production in their own areas. Of the two, however, Europe is by far the worst offender. Ireland should lead the way out of this policy that is both economically and morally bankrupt.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">No one could ever question the regard we have for farmers, agriculture and the rural way of life. If we were to say to our partners, with the moral standing we would have as a result of our own vested interests, that we have to find a better way of achieving our objectives, would they not listen to us? Would they listen if we were to say, with a degree of moral standing, that it is now time to turn our backs on the 20th century and find a way forward for agriculture that is right for the 21st century? They may or may not listen but at least we could be proud of what we were doing. Sadly, we cannot be proud of what we are doing now.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">For the past five years I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food and I realise these are harsh words but I do not have actual solutions. All I am saying is that in encouraging the continuance of the CAP, we are not taking even one step towards finding a way out of meeting immediate political objectives that are short term. I urge the Minister to give serious thought to how we can take a different attitude to this matter in the years ahead so that we, as a nation, can be proud of our farmers and our consumers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_309">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House this evening to listen to our concerns. There is no doubt that this has been a tough year for agriculture. In my own county in the north-west, farmers received €32 million in direct payments this year alone but that is not to say that farmers are millionaires. They are not, but farmers have to be treated differently from PAYE workers or others on salaries because to remain in farming farmers must reinvest the money they earned. That reinvestment process goes on all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I support the proposals put forward recently by Mr. Fischler because we need to decouple production to get away from the numbers, and payment should be area based. There are 7.5 million cattle in this country. Farmers must have numbers to survive in farming today. This is wrong. If payments were made through an area based system, cattle numbers would be reduced substantially. I would not be surprised if they were cut in half. We would then have a better quality animal produced at a much younger age. I heard the Minister say earlier that the days when one would see animals over 13 months, or even 24 to 30 months, are long gone. By reducing the numbers of cattle, farmers will be in a better position to feed them and a better quality of animal will go to the marketplace. That is the only way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I want to raise an issue which came to my notice recently. I come from the north-west, an area recognised as a major producer of store cattle. We depend very much on buyers coming Northern Ireland to buy store cattle. The value of sterling against the euro makes it very attractive for buyers from the North to buy our cattle, particularly in the north west. However, there now appears to be a doubt as to whether meat factories in the North will take cattle which have been reared on this side of the Border and subsequently fattened in Northern Ireland. There is also a question mark over the price which will be paid for such cattle. This serious issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I welcome the Minister's statement on the need for greater transparency in the relationship between meat factories and farmers. As matters stand, it is very clear that farmers do not trust the factories. This situation needs to be improved quickly because the producer and the processor must work together for the benefit of the entire sector. Any action which can be taken in that regard would be most welcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_122">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_313">I was surprised at the criticism of a former Minister from this side of the House by Senator Dardis, a representative of the party of transparency. Never before in the history of the State has there been such intervention by beef barons, big business and the Minister for Finance in the appointment of a Minister for Agriculture and Food. The Taoiseach's arm was twisted by all of those mentioned to convince him to reappoint the Minister, Deputy Walsh.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Fine Gael has always had a strong commitment to farmers which will continue under the leadership of Deputy Enda Kenny. This party has provided some of the best Ministers for Agriculture whose achievements were recognised, both within Ireland and in Europe. When we return to government, we will reduce the red tape which farmers have to endure when applying for funds and schemes to which they are entitled. The Government has imposed more heavy regulation, bureaucracy and penalties on agriculture than is the case in any other EU member state. I call on the Minister to ease the burden of regulations on farming and make penalties more proportionate to the extent of any infringement.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The present level of bureaucracy is grossly excessive. In many cases the penalties being applied are totally disproportionate to the nature of the infringement. I will quote a few examples from my home county, Longford. Farmer A had a 100% penalty applied to his REPS payment because he obliged a local football club by allowing the removal of a few metres of dangerously rusty barbed wire fence which was replaced by a beech hedgerow, thereby greatly enhancing the local environment. Is that fair treatment? Farmer B was penalised because an arm of the State, the Office of Public Works, broke a branch of a tree while cleaning a river running through his land. He was required by an inspector from the Department of Agriculture and Food to obtain an officially stamped letter from a senior official of the Department of Finance before part payment of his REPS grant would be considered. The most ridiculous example was that of farmer C who had a 100% penalty applied to his suckler cow grant because he did not replace a cow in April 2001 when the same Department was operating a total ban on the movement of animals during the foot and mouth disease crisis. The farmer concerned was informed of this penalty by registered letter. This unfair behaviour by the Department of Agriculture and Food must stop and a more human approach to farm inspections adopted. I appeal to the Minister to eliminate the current excessive penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The Minister will also be aware that huge numbers of farmers are getting out of sheep production due to the sheep register, which is proving to be a disaster, as well as the poor prices being paid for lamb. A recent response presented by the Department as a simplification has actually resulted in even greater complexity and unfairness than before. It is quite unworkable. I appeal to the Minister to replace the present cruel and complex system with a practical and workable flock-based system of identification and traceability.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">With regard to the REP scheme, I condemn the Government for taking €50 million out of its budget for 2002 as part of the cutbacks in agriculture. Once again, this proves that the Minister cannot argue our case at the Cabinet table. Instead of cutbacks at this time, rates of payment should be increased, especially for smaller farmers. The failure of the Minister to utilise the full REPS allocation in the Estimate for his Department is a clear indication that the national development plan target of 70,000 farmers in the scheme is unattainable. The current number of farmers participating is 15,000 less than projected, clearly demonstrating that the Government has failed to meet its own targets. I urge the Minister to reduce the level of bureaucracy and increase the payment rates by 50% in the scheme which is of great benefit in the implementation of the EU agri-environment programme. It is essential that more farmers are encouraged to join. The main reason this is not happening is that the present format of the scheme is no longer attractive. Payment rates are far too low, particularly for farms of less than 50 acres. The upper limit of 100 acres per farm is unduly restrictive, the scheme is overly bureaucratic and complex and penalties are too high.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">This is a very difficult year for farmers, with cattle and sheep prices under serious pressure and major losses as a result of the worst summer in recent memory, although I will not blame the Government for the weather.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_320">The political responsibility of averting disastrous price reductions this year rests with the Minister and the Government. The Minister has allowed cattle prices to drop to a disastrous level and failed to take action to secure higher prices, despite farmer protests at meat factories. If the Government does not respond to the appalling weather problems encountered by farmers this year, huge numbers of them will be forced out of business. I ask the Minister to initiate a national fodder assessment and provide an aid package for the worst affected farmers. I am dismayed by the lack of effort by the Government to maintain fair minimum prices for agricultural produce. The decline in prices is disastrous for small farmers. There are many flaws in the operation of the beef industry, with factories preventing price increases from being passed back to farmers. There is a yawning gap between the price paid by consumers and that received by farmers. These issues must be addressed by the Government. I hope the Minister will take action.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment. Contrary to Senator Bannon's comments, I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, on his magnificent achievements despite all the difficulties of the past year, including the very bad weather of last summer. I congratulate the Minister on paying to farmers 80% of the direct payments, which they received after 16 October. This was wonderful. Every farmer was delighted to receive this welcome money. The direct payments of €1.4 billion per annum under the CAP are also welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Prices, particularly beef prices, have fallen even further in the last two months. Farming is in decline but this is not the fault of the Government, which is fully committed to the development of agriculture. We must realise that major changes are taking place in agriculture and move forward with these changes. There is a decline in farming which cannot be helped. We are in competition with our European partners or comrades who produce pigmeat and chicken cheaper than we can. This is the reality and we cannot do much about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I would like to see many more people involved in farming. I ask the Minister of State to do everything in his power to encourage as many young people as possible to take up farming. If they do not, there will be a serious situation in ten or twenty years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Farmers are up in arms against the factories over the price of beef. The factories should improve their price because beef markets are improving. Finished cattle come out at this time of year and they are plentiful now. It is important that the factories pay the best possible price to cattle sellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Minister is doing a good job. He is doing his best in the circumstances. As a farmer I know that the bad weather was a greater problem this summer than the poor prices.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_329">Despite the fact that I am seen as a trade unionist I fully support investment in rural Ireland and the development of agriculture. It is a key industry and a crucial part of Irish life. The farming community and particularly the IFA should be asked to look at certain issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I listened carefully to Senator Dardis's speech. To give an example of the sort of double-think which I hear about regularly, Senator Dardis talked about the importance of income support in farm families which often need a second income. I was appalled to hear the president of the IFA call on the Government recently not to pay the benchmarking award despite the fact that the salaries of many teachers, gardaí, nurses and various others are going into farming houses around the country. It was neither strategic nor sensible to say this.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We should show support for the farming community and the agriculture industry because there is no bridge or link between the farmers' concerns and the consumers' concerns. Recent surveys have shown that the price of milk in some outlets is 500 times greater than the price farmers are paid for it. Why? This is an area where the Government can become involved. I agree that they cannot interfere with the competitiveness of the beef industry by stopping imports. That will not work, but there are things which can be done. There is a rip-off taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The other issue is the price of beef. We are looking at it the wrong way. The problem is not the price a farmer is receiving for beef, it is the price being charged in the supermarkets and where the difference is going. Surveys and consumers price indices show that there is no relationship between the farm-gate or factory price of beef and the price consumers are paying. Farmers are subject to the surges and spikes of the market but this is not reflected along the way. One of the reasons, which I would like the Minister to clarify, is the Abattoir Act which was passed ten years ago. I bitterly opposed this legislation on the floor of the House. It has had the impact of closing down abattoirs in every small town in Ireland. It means that a farmer cannot have a few sheep killed for his her own use or his neighbour's use. It means that a butcher can no longer raise animals on the land and kill them off the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">We have created a monster of non-traceability. There is no longer any indication where meat in a butcher's shop has come from. Certain shops indicate on the meat the name of the producer. I am assured by people working in abattoirs that this is next to impossible to do. In most cases it might be a fair attempt but does not do the business.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Why can this legislation not be amended? It is not in force in the rest of Europe. During the Nice referendum campaign a large group of sheep hill-farmers in the west of Ireland were completely opposed to it. They had very strong arguments which were unanswerable in many cases. They pointed to the fact that they were being deprived of their livelihood by ridiculous bureaucracy. I checked this and what I found was appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Much can be learned from one example. The farmer who produces a lamb is required to tag its left ear. The farmer who buys from the producing farmer is then required to put his tag on the sheep's right ear. I ask a very simple question. What happens a year later if the original farmer buys back the year old ewe for his own production purposes? This happens all the time in small areas. Does he now put two tags? I could not get an answer to this question when I sought it. It is a classic example.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I looked at the operation of a number of sheep and lamb co-ops. These people are being destroyed by bureaucracy in the sense that they make their living by buying wool and supplying veterinary products. All of those things now require two or three different trips which means that they are not in a position to supply material. If the lamb co-operative in Dingle wants to supply Beare Island with dose, dip or whatever, it must one day get the order and validate it and the next day go down to get the material. Two stages are needed and that is not right. There is no wool scouring plant in Ireland and every piece of Irish wool goes to Bradford.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I could mention various sectors of the agricultural industry but will simply say that there is much that could be done. This is about more important matters than the price of beef. Farmers need support, guidance, direction and infrastructure which is not there for them at present.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_338">I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time and what I have to say follows what the Senator has said. We are dealing with very old fashioned and complicated systems of animal identification, as Senator O'Toole has just said. I have asked the Department why it is not inclined to make progress with more modern methods of identification – for example, DNA testing methods such as Identigene which has been produced at Trinity College, Dublin. This had a better reception from the former Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland, Ms Bríd Rodgers, than from the Department of Agriculture and Food here. We must get more modern methods of identification into our animal production schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">We will have to sell on quality. People were horrified by what was described as the "Celticisation" of Cumbrian sheep which were taken from Scotland to Northern Ireland and then here. They were then apparently "Irish" lambs to be sold to the Paris market. We do not discuss EU directives until they are a fait accompli and I particularly recommend to the Minister that we become involved in the standardisation of analytical aspects of laboratory work.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">EU Directive ISO 17025-2000 has been issued recently and it focuses on the analytical aspects of laboratory work and all the functions that support it. This is an international standard and mandatory for laboratories carrying out testing and calibration of goods destined for the European market. It is also mandatory for medical microbiology laboratories in Ireland which carry out a public health function for food control and, under EU legislation, are approved by the Department of Health and Children as food testing laboratories. This is a generic led standard for all laboratories carrying out testing and calibration functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Many medical professionals are divided on the suitability of this standard. It deals with category three facilities such as e.coli 0157 which in the last 20 years has become such a problem with beef. Could we get in on the discussions on these directives before we are sent a fait accompli? These directives are interpreted totally differently in other countries and we are left out on a limb by our interpretation of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">The fundamental problem facing farming is uncertainty about the medium and long-term future. That is why, contrary to what Senator Quinn has said, the agreement at the European Council in Brussels is such a big advance in that it provides a degree of certainty until 2013 and leaves quite a bit of room available. It is an immense achievement and in some ways is a reward for the "Yes" vote on the Nice treaty because it is doubtful that this would have happened if the vote had gone the other way. It is a vindication of the Franco-Irish alliance, including the political alliance between Fianna Fáil and the Gaullist party.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The CAP is not that expensive. It is about 1.2% of GNP in terms of expenditure, if translated into domestic expenditure, and is an economical form of support that is vital to the fabric of the societies of all EU member states. I disagree with Senator Quinn who would have us give up the CAP without having any particular alternative in mind. With all due respect to the Senator, I am not clear that the morality of the supermarket interest is superior to the morality of the farm interest, and there is a wide gap between what is received at the farm gate and what is received elsewhere. To be fair to the social partners and those such as Senator O'Toole, they recognise the interdependence that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Security of supply is the key reason underpinning the Common Agricultural Policy. I remember talking to New Zealand's Minister for Agriculture and hearing him complain about the Saudis and Japanese putting vast amounts of money into uneconomical agriculture. However, those countries very legitimately did not want to be completely dependent on imports. Food is the most vital product and countries do not want to be dependent on distant markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I have reservations about the Fischler proposals. If supports are divorced from production, it will not be long before the newspapers highlight people getting vast amounts of money for doing nothing. That will undermine political support for the CAP.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">Many Senators have referred to the fact that the Minister has recognised the adverse effects the recent difficult weather conditions have had on farming and has brought forward the advance payments to farmers, at a rate of 80% instead of the usual 60%, as well as advancing 50% of cereal payments to arable farmers. That is welcome as is his announcement of the high rate of export refunds to Egypt.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Many farming organisations have met with Oireachtas Members about issues they wanted pursued by the Minister.

The Minister and this Government should take up those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Dealer registration for bona fide farmers and the identification system, abouot which many Senators have spoken, are issues I would like to see addressed.

          <p eId="para_355">The IFA talked about an important social policy issue relating to the health service, that of the carer's payment, and particularly about PRSI coverage for farm spouses. That issue has not been dealt with in an adequate way. There have been many areas where the PAYE sector is helped the most, including the family income supplement scheme. Self-employed persons like those running their own businesses on farms do not seem to qualify under many of these schemes, which is unfortunate. Farm spouses made a strong case to the Minister for inclusion. I hope these issues will be addressed and thank the Minister for his fine speech.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">That Seanad Éireann, recognising</p>
          <p eId="para_359">– the advances carried out by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Department over the past five years,</p>
          <p eId="para_360">– the improvements in social welfare payments, and</p>
          <p eId="para_361">– the improvements in services and information from her Department to its clients,</p>
          <p eId="para_362">in the light of the upcoming budget Estimates and the talks on social partnership calls on the Minister to maintain a strong role in the progressing of services and facilities for the disadvantaged and in social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Minister to the House. If we look at the significant changes which have taken place in this area in recent years, we can see the reason the motion, which I hope the House will support, is important. It is necessary to maintain this strong role and continue to progress the services and facilities for the disadvantaged and to include those who were on the margins but are now becoming involved and included in society. I intend to focus on a number of the key initiatives and major improvements that have taken place in the area of social and family affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Without a doubt, the first area on which the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government acted in the last five years – hopefully in the next five – was child benefit. The universal payment made directly to families, in most cases to mothers, is the single most effective payment in recognising the contribution women make to the home and parenthood. It also represents a major move towards achieving the goal of ending child poverty. There is nothing worse than seeing our children go hungry or cold, or without money to engage in school or social activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Child benefit will never be enough. No Government could ever give enough money to enable mothers to do all that they might want for their children, but the increases in 2002 bring the investment in child benefit to €1.44 billion, three times the 1997 figure. We saw an increase in the two child benefit rate of over €79 and €98 respectively in recent years. Such a level of increase is record breaking and I appeal to the Minister, whom I hope we all support in her negotiations with the Department of Finance, to ensure the final third increase, as initiated by her predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is paid in the forthcoming budget. I also plead with her to stand her ground and ensure there is no taxation of this payment which goes to the heart of the family and has benefited both women and their families for years. Any derogation in its effectiveness is not something over which we could stand. I strongly believe we could not contemplate either a reduction in the expected increases or taxation of these payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I realise that we do not have much time, but I must mention one area where there were difficulties with the old Department, that is, communication and customer care. There have been significant improvements in how members of the public are dealt with. We have seen automated leaflet and application requests on line which recognises that 60% of the over 4 million telephone calls received by the Department are requests for leaflets or application forms. There are also lo-call telephone numbers for the maternity benefits section and the publication by Comhairle of the Department's document on the recent entitlements for the over 60s. I compliment the Minister on this wonderful publication which is clear and makes it easy to find what is available as well as outlining the means tests and payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I preface all my remarks by recognising that while many things have been done, not everything that could be done is done, in particular in relation to carers. The Government, like its predecessor, has long been committed to continuing to develop the services which recognise the caring ethos in this country and the practical assistance for those who devote their time to improving the quality of life of others, that is, carers of older people, those with a disability and in any circumstance where someone gives up time to provide care. This is also an area where women tend to predominate. It is often an older woman looking after a middle aged child with a disability at home, which relieves the burden on the residential care sector. We have made a significant impact in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The annual respite grant of €635 with a double payment where the carer looks after more than one person is to be welcomed. The carers of children who receive domiciliary care allowance are now eligible to apply for carer's allowance. This makes a significant difference to those women at home looking after children with a disability as it means that they have additional money because often domiciliary care allowance goes directly to support the child to improve his or her quality of life. All carers who receive carer's allowance are now entitled to the free schemes, such as travel, which is a huge benefit. The income disregards have also been significantly increased, both for individuals and couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Members of the Opposition will say we should get rid of the means test, but the figures on the cost of abolishing it show that it is better to keep it while increasing the income disregards instead of giving carer's allowance to everyone whether they need it. The numbers receiving carer's allowance and benefit have more than doubled from 9,700 to over 19,000 in recent years while expenditure increased by 180%.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">There has been an almost 50% increase in old age pensions in five years and a commitment to see the basic pension increase to at least €200 by 2007. It was raised to €127 by 2002. All old age pensioners recognise that this represents an increase of 24% above the rate of inflation, in addition to the increases and additional services that the over 70s receive, regardless of means tests, such as the medical card and other free schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">We can see some improvement in regard to communications to widows who, under the stress of having lost a loved one who was perhaps the breadwinner, often do not have the confidence to approach the Department for information. It is important to provide a leaflet designed for widows or those who have been bereaved. The needs of younger widows and widowers have not been forgotten by the Department. A special widowed parent grant has been enhanced to €2,500 to help bereaved families at this difficult time. This is a recognition of the work that has been done in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I have a final request to make to the Minister in regard to free travel. A person of 65 years of age who has free travel can get a companion pass for a spouse. A person with a free pass because of disability is also entitled to a companion pass. However, a widow or widower cannot get a companion pass because he or she has not got a spouse. I ask the Minister to look at the extension of free travel so that widows or widowers can apply for a companion pass so that they will have the opportunity to take someone with them when travelling. As they get older they need a companion to give them the confidence to get out and avail of the free travel. This is something that would not cost a huge amount and should be kept in mind for the budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_373">I second the motion. This motion put so eloquently by Senator Cox recognises the advances and improvements implemented by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. There have been dramatic and far reaching changes over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">As a former employee of the Department I have seen the effects its services on the day to day lives of people. I have seen at the coal face the efficient delivery of the amazing range of services for which the Department has responsibility. It deals with support schemes for areas such as adult literacy, schemes for younger and older people, pensioners, widows and widowers, the unemployed, people with disabilities, children and carers. I have seen the direct effect of these services on the lives of people across the board through direct income for daily living, support for both dual and single parent families, advice on money management and through support for men's and women's and senior citizens groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Department has been progressive in the provision of services to its clients. In the early 1980s the Department was one of the first to grasp the nettle of computerisation. The staff and management made a huge effort to improve and streamline the service it provided. The result was the modernisation of the payment delivery system. Another indication of the Department's progressiveness is decentralisation of services to local offices around the country. This started in Dublin and Cork with the provision of local offices but has been further extended to regions such as Limerick, Longford, Louth, Leitrim and Galway. The decentralisation of the head office to Sligo was a huge success and provided a great impetus to that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Every day in my own constituency I come across some group or organisation which has benefited from some input from the Department. Last Monday I met a group from O'Deveney Gardens where a group of parents got together to set up a child care facility. There has been huge input from the Department in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Garda and from the local authority. Today there is a thriving community facility which caters for the children of a socially deprived area and it is just one example of how the Department has built itself into a community resource over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I do not doubt this Minister will continue the work done over the years by her predecessors and in the true tradition of previous Fianna Fáil Governments will further enhance the vast improvement in services and provisions for those dependent on social welfare, advancing the superb work that has been achieved in the area of social inclusion and support for the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Nowadays if people come to an advice centre it is easy to make contact with the Department through a direct phone connection and we can get information for them. The booklets produced by the Department are excellent and the information provided is helpful. It is much easier now for a public representative to provide information to those who require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Some of the achievements of the past few years reveal startling statistics. If the economic climate allowed this to continue the improvements would be dramatic. For example, in the area of pensions a couple, both over 66 years of age, get 54% more than five years ago. That is staggering. A special widowed parent grant to help bereaved parents with financial costs has been enhanced to €2,500. The personal rate of payment for most recipients of social welfare has increased by at least 37%, while the corresponding rate for a couple has increased by over 44%.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">One of the simple things that makes a difference to the lives of people on social welfare payments is the Christmas bonus. The bonus paid out is now 100% and 792,000 recipients and an estimated 413 dependants will benefit from that. Old age, retirement, invalidity, one-parent family payments and employment support payments are areas which benefit from this bonus. Certain participants in FÁS and VTOS will also benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The ESRI recently reported that consistent poverty in Ireland has been reduced by two thirds between 1994 and 2000. It fell 15.1% in 1994, 18.2% in 1998 and 6.2% in 2000. These are facts. I congratulate the Minister and wish her well. I am sure she will continue the excellent record of this and previous Governments in this area.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_383">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_384">"recognises the fact that relative income poverty has increased by 50% in Ireland over the last six years and that the Minister for Finance has deliberately favoured higher income earners in successive budgets and calls on the Government to discriminate positively in favour of the poor, disadvantaged and those on low incomes in the forthcoming budget."</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Never before has a Government had so much money and delivered so little to the poor, the disadvantaged and those living on the margins of society. Why did Fianna Fáil choose to table such a motion when homelessness remains at such an alarmingly high level, the carer's allowance is still means tested, people on the minimum wage are still in the tax net and do not qualify for a medical card, spending cuts, or adjustments as the Minister might prefer to call them, are targeted at people working with the disadvantaged and those with disabilities and local authority lists are at crisis levels? I could go on but I know it would not make a blind bit of difference to my colleagues on the Government side of the House who obviously believe poverty and disadvantage do not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The question is often asked as to who is poor. The national anti-poverty strategy in 1997 and the NAPS review of this year stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_387">People are living in poverty if their income and resources (material, cultural and social) are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living that is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally. As a result of inadequate income and resources people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities that are considered the norm for other people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Thousands of people throughout the country fit that description.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Despite a period of unprecedented prosperity, the scale of poverty has not been tackled effectively. Social welfare rates have not kept pace with improving standards of living and the gap between rich and poor has widened dramatically. This is a major scandal and a sad reflection on Government priorities in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The extent of poverty in Ireland has been highlighted by the United Nations human development report of 2001. Of 17 industrialised countries, Ireland ranked 16th in the poverty index. Only the United States of America had a higher percentage of its population living in poverty. All the major countries in Europe did better than Ireland where poverty was concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">There is no doubt that Ireland has become a much more prosperous place. However, the distribution of that prosperity has been such that the Celtic tiger dividend has been non-existent for a large number of citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Last Monday I visited one of the most disadvantaged areas in Waterford city which is in my electoral area and where the rate of unemployment is more than 40%. Three years ago, there were 20 community employment workers in the area dealing with child care, youth work, the long-term unemployed and other areas of community development. This year, despite protestations from everyone involved, their allocation is ten community employment workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The services have had to be cut back drastically and that deprived community is suffering as a result. The services to the unemployed, such as preparing CVs, advice on interviews, job applications and so on, have been cut back to two days a week. Youth services especially are curtailed when they should be expanding. This is the type of commitment to disadvantaged communities over which the Government presides and we are being asked to allow for more of the same by supporting this Fianna Fáil motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Urgent action is required to tackle the social crisis which stems from the continued marginalisation of people with a disability. There should be no barriers to inclusion and it is a political and moral duty of the State to enable and encourage in every way possible independent living for everyone with a disability. At a minimum, the State should recognise the additional financial cost of a disability. A glaring injustice is where a carer is precluded from availing of the carer's allowance if he or she receives another State benefit. It beggars belief that the mother caring for her child with a disability is not entitled to the carer's allowance if she becomes a widow and receives a widow's pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The Government must acknowledge the harsh truth that people with disabilities and their families continue to experience high levels of poverty and social exclusion, a fact which has been verified by the Economic and Social Research Institute. We are told the Government must prioritise in the area of social inclusion and every other area because of the deteriorating state of the public finances. Why could it not have provided for and discriminated positively in favour of the disadvantaged when we had a budget surplus of more than €5 billion last year?</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The previous Government failed miserably to address the many areas I have mentioned. The current Government has a chance to redress the balance. It said it is committed to tackling poverty and disadvantage. By its deeds we will judge it, not its promises.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_405">The two issues mentioned are important, namely, the carer's allowance and home help, and I would like to link them. The manner in which carers are treated is regrettable given the work they do in keeping patients in their community and the money they save the Government by caring for those people in their homes rather than their occupying valuable bed space in hospitals. We know what it costs to keep a person in hospital and the Minister will inform us of that later. It is a disgrace that a Government that was so flush with cash over the past five years made it so difficult for people to obtain the carer's allowance, and when they did, for the allowance to be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The same can be said about home help. In addition, the remuneration they receive for the magnificent work they do is a scandal. That must be seen in the context of the amount of money they save the Government. Senator Wilson is laughing but in his heart he agrees with me because he has similar difficulties in his family.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">The needs of the less well off in society are a serious matter because such people suffered the most and carried the brunt of cutbacks in bad times when the economy was in trouble. Yet, when the economy was booming, they were forgotten by the Government. They were not given the same benefit. What is the point in talking about percentage increases when 10% of nothing is still nothing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_152" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_412">However, 10% of a large figure would make a big difference. An increase of 10% for people like the Minister, at the top of the ranking, will yield more than many poor people get in a lifetime. If a person on low pay gets 10%, the reality is they are getting very little. Let us consider the new poor in society, the farming community. Why is there so little uptake in the farm assist scheme? It is because of the level of bureaucracy, the difficulty farmers have in applying for it and the way their income is scrutinised in order to qualify.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Senators on the opposite side talk about the poor and clap themselves on the back for what they have done for them. Fair play, they have helped them out in good times, but not remotely to the extent they should have. Fr. Seán Healy of CORI can tell them the extent of poverty and homelessness. Why do they not tell us about the way social welfare is administered? I have seen social welfare officers telling people who depend on social welfare they are not entitled to it. They are then removed from the system and left in dire poverty for up to three months before it is sorted out. They have to go to the community welfare officer who will claim not to have anything to give them. Is that the sort of society we are advocating?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_414">I welcome and congratulate the Minister. I am delighted to see her in this role as another Minister with responsibility for social welfare from a Border county.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I am not an expert on social welfare policy, but I regard it as an important priority policy, perhaps the highest political priority of the next budget. Even in the last budget the social welfare package was considerably more than the tax package. That will certainly, definitely and indisputably be the case this time around. Undoubtedly, many things need to be done and although we are very proud of our record, I do not have a quarrel with the second part of the Fine Gael amendment which calls on the Government to discriminate positively in favour of the poor, disadvantaged and those on low incomes in the forthcoming budget. I am sure that is what the Minister will do with support from the Taoiseach and her other Government colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There is a very good record of improvement but there are also big problems. There were the free schemes in the 1960s, which were very imaginative and much credit is due to Charles Haughey when he was a Minister. There was a big improvement in the rates when we joined the EU, both under Frank Cluskey as Minister and again under Charles Haughey in the late 1970s. There were fantastic 25% increases in old age pensions in 1980, 1981 and 1982. In 1987 when the economic situation was dire, one decision made was that there would be no cutbacks in social welfare and the Government implemented the commission on social welfare report, which the previous Fine Gael and Labour coalition had said would cost too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">On the doorsteps at the recent general election, there was a very positive response both to the fantastic increases in old age pensions and in child benefit. However, we should not be under any illusion that it is easy to live on a social welfare income and people should be given encouragement to make additional provision for themselves where they are able. In discussions at Government the Minister should stress the importance of protecting the pension fund. I do not want to see a debate develop here over the next ten or 20 years asking if we can afford our old people. Making provision now will make it less controversial in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">There is a certain analytical poverty in the way we discuss some of these issues. The model we keep hearing about focuses on the rich and the poor. There are rich people and there are certainly many poor people. However, the vast majority of people are in between and the rhetoric about rich and poor leaves that out of account. When an economy is growing fast there is a tendency for gaps to widen somewhat and that should be corrected as much as possible. I am very glad there is a Government commitment to get rid of absolute or consistent poverty. However, given a choice, it would be preferable for people to be absolutely better off, even though relatively poorer, than to be relatively better off and absolutely less well off. Sometimes people talk as if that is not really the case. I know Fr. Healy very well and while people like him are very well intentioned, some of the economics are very faulty. There is no point in implementing old-fashioned socialist economics, which only have the effect of reducing the resources available for everything, including caring.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">If I were to make one plea to the Minister, it would be to pay special attention to the humane spirit of decision-making on social welfare issues. This is both humane in terms of individual cases and also in terms of trying to iron out the anomalies that create unfairness and injustice. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">There is a constant problem when social welfare payments are increased at a budget. The next day people get a note through the door advising that the differential rent is being increased at the same time. Even though a different authority is involved, there is too much giving with one hand and taking back with the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">It is true to say the Celtic tiger did not reach all places, but it largely eliminated unemployment, which everybody agreed ten or 15 years ago was the key cause of poverty. I support the Minister and the Government and if the forthcoming budget is not to be distinguished for changes in taxation, it should nonetheless be distinguished by an enlightened social welfare package.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_422">I very much welcome the Minister to the House and I am particularly glad she is in the Ministry she is in. In other forums, I have found her very sympathetic to the fact that the family is not just the nuclear unit we have been used to for a long time, but she takes a much broader view on the whole issue, which is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Government motion is a good one, because there have been dramatic improvements in social welfare payments in recent years. More spectacularly, there have been improvements in services and information from her Department and its clients. I have complimented the staff from that Department many times when they have come to this House about the dramatic improvement in acting as though the citizens of this country had rights rather than thinking they were giving them some sort of largesse, which was not their own money except for a small proportion from tax. I very much welcome the improved attitude regarding the treatment of those who have to come before people with social welfare problems. As a doctor, naturally I would be well aware of the very shabby way people were treated in the past, as though they barely had a right to ask for their dues at all. I welcome what the Minister and her predecessors in the Department have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I am sorry that the amendment is true. There has been a huge increase in relative poverty in the last six years and it seems to affect a hard core of people. Poverty levels are measured on different scales but there is a hard core of people whose lot we do not seem to have been able to improve, even though in some cases they perhaps could claim for more.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The Minister for Finance seems to have a terrible problem, though I do not know how it arose between May and now. Apparently there is a great shortage of money that was not evident before the general election in May. Now there are startling revelations and though they are not this Minister's fault she will have to bear with them as the Minister for Finance will have to do something to balance the budget. We have said tonight she has a dissatisfied group and she will have a dissatisfied group in the Seanad if some of what we ask for does not come to pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">All strategies should be considered as to how they affect children, no matter what Department they come from. That is often tagged on at the end but if it is a priority then there is a really good start to the strategy. The Minister's plans five or six years ago gave a commitment to great increases in child benefit and there have been great increases, though there could be more. He made a commitment to bring child benefit to €31.60 per month and €38.10 per month at the higher end. Those were very good increases but if they were part of the expectations of poorer families it would be a good idea for them to get those increases now. Child dependency allowances should also be increased to a weekly rate of €25 per child.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Support for children by way of actual money is terribly important. Unfortunately we have not been doing anything about child care and many people working outside the home must spend some of this money paying up front for child care, so getting hard cash is terribly important. I urge the Minister to encourage the Minister for Finance to do this. We could integrate the family income supplement into the tax system and perhaps examine the introduction of a refundable child tax credit. The children's allowance people will have been on to the Minister with all these suggestions and I hope they have contacted other Senators also. Some of the suggestions could be implemented in the current budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Naturally I looked at child health care very carefully and the medical card situation is very bad. Our statistics are extremely odd regarding the number of medical cards actually available to the population – it is probably less than 30% of the population now; though the figures say 33% it is probably much less. The Minister may remember that last year when the Minister for Health and Children brought in eligibility for medical cards for the over 70s another third of people had to be added on – those who were not expected to be on the register at all. Colleagues in primary care tell me that less than 30% of the population are actually eligible, which affects children first and foremost. We have talked and talked about extending the eligibility of children and perhaps that could be done now – it is certainly one of the most important things in the health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">We are trying to do something about waiting lists for children and I hope that commitment is honoured. We also need to put a great deal of money into those initiatives that particularly affect children, initiatives dealing with drug dependency and, sadly, with alcohol dependency as well as substance abuse. We heard again today about the sad death of a 15 year old due to substance abuse. How much are we doing about these cases? This requires resources because it is not so much the treatment of the child when it happens as a matter of acting in the education system to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">It is also important to improve the community services which could prevent drug and alcohol addiction. There are too many people in urban areas in particular who have been trying for years to get resources for initiatives that would help communities and families but they have not been able to get them. Perhaps the Minister could urge that some funding be provided for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Children with disabilities form another important group and the domiciliary care allowance is not great – it does not come near to covering the cost of caring for a person. I regret the building of the children's prison; if money was put into the Minister's Department and community care there would be far less need for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">We are also desperately short of child psychologists in many areas where they would be helpful – the Minister's Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. I urge the Minister for Health and Children to reverse the decision to cancel the courses in clinical psychology in both Trinity College and University College Dublin. Because of that cancellation we will not be producing one new clinical psychologist before 2005 and we are short 50% of our requirement now. Trying to recruit from abroad has not proved satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I wish the Minister well in what she is trying to do. She should go in and really fight.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">I will kick a ball but then I will leave, as Senator McHugh will know.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The period since 1997 has been one of extraordinary change in Ireland's economic fortunes. The growth in national income has been at a record rate for the longest period in the history of the State. This has allowed for growth in personal incomes, in employment and in the general standard of living. It has provided for the investment in our future that continues to be crucial for our economic and social development. Over that time, many of the traditional economic indicators changed out of all recognition. Employment grew rapidly and unemployment fell to record lows. Immigration halted and actually reversed as new opportunities were created in our economy for emigrants who had left during leaner times. National income per head grew to such an extent that we are now one of the wealthier countries in Europe instead of previous classification amongst the poorest.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The improvement in our economic fortunes has allowed many of the fundamental problems of Irish society to be addressed. The benefits of this economic growth were felt right across our society and economy. While we need to continue to address some of these at the same time as new challenges are being identified, the record from the past few years should give us confidence that we can rise to the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The fall in unemployment and in long-term unemployment has shown the most dramatic change in our fortunes. Unemployment fell from 10.25% in 1997 to 4.25% in the second quarter of this year. The level of long-term unemployment has fallen by 1.25% compared with a figure of over 5.5% in 1997. However, the Government has not simply relied on the fall in the level of unemployment to make an improvement in the well-being of those on lower incomes which we have combined with real improvements in social welfare spending and the delivery of social welfare services.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The development and implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy by the Government have allowed for a coherent and focused approach to poverty and social inclusion. There is clear evidence that this has provided tangible results in terms of the reduction in poverty and the improvement in the quality of life experienced by the most disadvantaged groups in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The NAPS seeks to provide for a consistent and coherent approach to Government policy across a range of policy measure and programmes to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and social exclusion in society. It does this by the development and implementation of programmes and policies which sustain economic growth and employment. It aims to provide levels of income support for those relying on social welfare sufficient to sustain dignity and avoid poverty while facilitating participation in employment and escape from welfare dependency. It seeks to provide high quality public services for all and address the needs of groups at high risk of poverty with specific needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The NAPS aims to tackle the causes of inter-generational transmission of poverty and support disadvantaged communities. It does this by identifying key targets in a number of areas that go to the heart of the underlying problems. As a global target, it uses the measure of consistent poverty developed by the ESRI from its expertise in the analysis of incomes and poverty to measure the progress made in addressing the issue of poverty in Ireland. The measure of consistent poverty uses income thresholds combined with deprivation indicators to measure the number of people or households in poverty. Recent years have seen significant reductions in the level of consistent poverty in Ireland, due, <i>inter alia,</i> to increases in employment and reductions in unemployment. This is what the Senator referred to in his analysis. At the end of the day, however, it is only an academic discussion. In 1994 the level of consistent poverty was 15.1% which was more than halved to 6% in 2000, the latest year for which figures are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The policies pursued by the Government in recent years in combating unemployment and reducing the level of consistent poverty have brought about a significant improvement in the situation of those on lower incomes. The NAPS strategy has ambitious targets across a number of areas which will further the Government's goal of creating a society where everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. In particular, it has a new target to reduce the numbers consistently poor to below 2% and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">One of the key issues underlying the development of the NAPS strategy is the adequacy of social welfare rates, attention to which has been central to the development of social welfare policy in recent years, to which the previous Government committed considerable resources. Let me give just two examples. In 1997 the lower rate of child benefit was just over €38 per month. By 2002 it had been increased to €117.60 – an increase of over 200%. In 1997 old age contributory pension was only €99 per week. After budget 2002, it stood at €147.30 – an increase of almost 50% – well ahead of inflation and increases in average earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The Government will seek to build on this progress and has made a range of commitments in relation to social welfare payments in our programme for Government. These include increasing the basic State pension to at least €200 by 2007, achieving a rate of €150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rates of social welfare to be met by 2007, and completing the announced programme of multi-annual increases in child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">As the Taoiseach said recently at the launch of the talks on a new social partnership agreement, the Government programme sets out an agenda for all strategic areas of Government activity aimed at building a fair society of equality and opportunity and sustained prosperity for all. Through these commitments, the Government will seek to build upon the improvements in recent years and the progress made in the reduction of consistent poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I will now speak about the issue of partnership and the series of national agreements which have made such a large contribution to the development of policy in relation to social welfare and economic and social development generally. Partnership has been key to this approach, not only in ensuring the development of policies, but also in their effective implementation. The inclusive approach has brought together the main actors in the economy and society with a view to coming to a common understanding about our problems and addressing them in a coherent and consistent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">In recent years the Government has more than fulfilled its commitments on social inclusion made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Significant progress has been made toward the core objective of bringing about a fairer and inclusive society. I know that the negotiations which have just started in relation to a successor agreement will raise a considerable number of difficult issues. However, I am confident that the spirit of partnership will allow these to be addressed in a spirit of mutual co-operation and in the belief that the gains at national level of the period since partnership began can once again be secured.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">There is no doubt that the circumstances around which the forthcoming budget will be drawn up are significantly less promising that those of earlier years. However, the Government has committed itself to ensure social progress continues to be made side by side with economic progress. In the context of the difficult decisions that will have to be made, my parliamentary party and I will certainly ensure those most vulnerable in society will not be the ones to bear it. We have outlined commitments and priorities with regard to widows, the household budget package and in the context of carers. I am very much aware that carers and carer's allowance and benefit are issues which all Senators deal with in their clinics. The figures show the huge number of new persons now contributing as carers because of the introduction of the new scheme of carer's benefit. Increased numbers are participating in the carer's allowance scheme as a consequence of the disregard. I know that in a perfect society it would be fantastic to be able to stand up and say I could abandon the means test for carer's allowance. I cannot do so at present, but will support carers in society. I agree that there is no argument when one compares the cost of institutional care against that of a carer.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I have not been long in the Department but the 4,500 who work in it are caring and considerate and more than helpful. I appreciate that little blips often appear in the system, but they can be dealt with at a local level. I support all those civil servants who provide information and support networks for those in difficulty and who have been more than flexible in the context of particular and personal difficulties. I hope there will be an enlightened social welfare package and the Minister for Finance is listening to this debate. We have achieved much in the context of social welfare packages. The supports now provided cannot be judged in monetary terms. The Department has expanded its role in the support of the less well-off and the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I hope I will have the opportunity during my tenure to look at expanding the role of the family side of my Department along with the family support unit. The targeting of resources, the elimination of child poverty and supporting the less well off will be the hallmark of this Government over the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Guím gach rath ar Sheanadóirí ocáid a thabhairt dom a chur in iúl caidé tá déanta ag an Rialtas cheana agus caidé tá le déanamh. Gabhaim buíochas leo siúd a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I always listen to what is being said. Like the Senator, I can hear three conversations at the same time and can jump into any one of them. I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter and to hear the priorities of this House in the context of social welfare and the elimination of poverty. Regardless of what political side we are on, everyone in their heart of hearts believes the elimination of poverty should be a goal in any just society.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">Performance in any area, particularly in an area where change is taking place, can only be measured against the potential and not against some fixed reference. For instance, if the Leas-Chathaoirleach or I ran in a marathon, we would not measure our performance against that of a professional athlete because we would not be starting from the same position. When one adjudicates on or looks at the performance of the previous Government and the philosophy which underpins the present Government, one does not look at it in terms of numbers but in terms of what was possible. In terms of what was possible, little was done. I do not deny that there was a spectacular change in child benefit but let us remember that was not driven by a passion to eliminate poverty but by the need to facilitate the expansion of the labour force in times when there was a constraint on it and because IBEC and others wanted large-scale improvements in child benefit. We would be still waiting for those changes if they were not driven by the scandal of the fact we have the worst child care provision in western Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">Warped it may be but I have been called worse, so I will live with that. The driving force behind this was the profound reluctance of the previous Government to provide proper child care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Let us look at the numbers. The level of what the Irish establishment, epitomised by the present Government, believes to be an adequate income is the sort of figure which, in most of our newspaper reviews, would be regarded as a reasonable price for a meal in some of Dublin's best restaurants – in fact, it would be regarded as a cheap price for a meal in perhaps the nearest restaurant to this House across the road in Merrion Street. We are talking about entirely different worlds. What this and the previous Government singularly failed to do was to do anything about inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I suppose the poor should be grateful because we now know consistent poverty has been reduced. An indicator of the reduction in consistent poverty is that the number of people who said they could only buy second-hand clothes rather than new ones has declined from 10% to 3%. Hallelujah. Only 3% of our population must now buy second-hand clothes. I would not boast about that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I would not boast about that since that happened because more people were at work. Of course we welcome that fact. The impetus for the growth in employment started before the previous Government came into office. Given the práiseach it made of the public finances over the last year, I suspect that impetus will grind to a halt quite rapidly because of its inability to realise that society and the economy are not the same thing. That is the fundamental problem this Government has had for the past six years, that is, that it cannot understand that there is a difference between social development and economic growth. It has put all its eggs in the basket of economic growth and has consistently set itself the task of redistributing wealth upwards in the direction of those who are most well off in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">In the last budget, according to the Combat Poverty Agency, 60% of the cash transfers between tax and social welfare went to the top 30% of income earners. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to discover that relative income poverty, the proportion of our population who have incomes below 60% of the average income, has not changed significantly in spite of the fact we have gone from being perhaps the eighteenth richest country in the world to perhaps the second or third richest. If one comes from the technocratic school of economics, then that does not matter. One may well have a flicker of a tear in the corner of one's eye for the 3% who must buy second-hand clothes but one does not really care about inequality.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Let us remember what inequality means. Inequality means that one cannot afford to pay for a proper health service and one must depend on the State health service. What the State has decreed is that if one is single and has an income in excess of €122 per week, one is deemed to be rich enough to be able to pay for one's own health care. Somebody on €123 per week is deemed to be able to afford to pay €65 per month for prescription medicine. They do not have to buy second-hand clothes nor do they fall into the other indicators of consistent poverty, and I am glad for their sake that they do not. However, a society which decides that a single person on €125 per week can afford to pay €65 per month for prescription medicine and €40 or €50 every time they visit an out-patient department in a hospital may well be doing something about consistent poverty but it is doing nothing about inequality in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The trouble is that while the increases in welfare payments were welcome, the previous Government was inept in a host of other areas. It spent a fortune on the health services and after spending the money, it produced a strategy. Most reasonable people would have done the reverse. Most people on average incomes have given up on the dream of owning a house. Local authority housing is unavailable to most people unless they are waiting for two years. Those factors mean that the otherwise welcome increases in the income of the poorest will make no contribution to eliminating inequality and injustice in our society because this Government, like the previous one, does not understand the difference between inequality and poverty. We can eliminate consistent poverty – I hope we will do so – but if we continue to put together a society which is the most profoundly unequal in the western world with the exception of the United States, we will never be able to produce the sort of housing that will get our people out of poverty. We will never be able to produce the quality of life that our people expect. While social welfare increases are to be welcomed, this motion represents such a limited vision of the future, of equality and of what poverty should really be about that it is not worthy of support.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_466">I was delighted to see the Minister for Social and Family Affairs here this evening. As a fellow Ulster person I am delighted to see her being made responsible for such a major Department. I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. If I had not been here to witness it myself, I would not have believed that a Labour Party Senator could have said he looks forward to the unemployment rates going up again.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, is responsible for the family as well as social affairs, and it is with the family that I would like to begin. This Government is committed to adopting a "families first" approach by putting the family at the centre of all our policies. As a republican party, a party which seeks to develop an egalitarian society, Fianna Fáil has always believed that we must put families first. Our approach recognises the dynamism and diversity of family life today. It also places a very strong emphasis on protecting the interests of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">We have a very clear vision of the type of family we want to build in today's Ireland. We cannot, and should not, go back to the old style authoritarian family where children know their place. However, we certainly do not want to see the excessive individualism that can be seen in some countries, where it is all "me, me, me" and where family life does not get a look in. Our challenge is to blend the love and support which existed in traditional families with the recognition that all family members – men, women and children – have rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">In relation to family-friendly policies, we are committed as a Government to supporting parents in taking up work where they want to do so, but we are also committed to supporting parents who choose to care in the home. That is why, in recent budgets, we decided to invest massively in child benefit. The Government is supporting the choices parents themselves are making in caring for their children. That is why we increased the pension payable to women in the home to the full old age non-contributory pension rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The latest child benefit increases form part of the largest ever series of increases in child benefit in the history of the State. After only five years, the basic rate has been trebled and a family with three children will receive €257 more per month than in 1997. In 1997 – and I know Senator McHugh will be interested in this – Deputies Michael Noonan and Ruairi Quinn gave a family with three children a monthly increase of a paltry £7 per month. Fianna Fáil in Government, with our partners the Progressive Democrats, has given that same family €101.60 extra per month in each of the last two years. To combat child poverty, we have made the largest increases in child benefit in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">For the future, Fianna Fáil pledges to raise the old age pension to €200 per week. We will also introduce a homemaker's pension for pensioner spouses currently in receipt of the qualified adult allowance, set at the level of a full non-contributory pension. People in receipt of old age pensions are very appreciative and conscious of the major improvement in the rates of payment over recent years. The Fianna Fáil Party made a decision in 1997 that on election to office a special effort would be made to improve the lot of our pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">There have been major improvements in the rates of payments and the free schemes have been improved and extended. The eligibility criteria to avail of these schemes have been improved and this has enabled the numbers availing of these schemes to increase considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">We are all conscious of the importance of the carer's allowance scheme, which has been mentioned by most speakers. This scheme has enabled thousands of people to be cared for at home who would otherwise have to be hospitalised or cared for in nursing homes. The conditions to avail of the carer's allowance scheme have been eased in recent years, but I am sure the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will agree that further improvements are necessary. We all know of applications that narrowly fail to meet all the criteria, and I hope that the Minister, during her term of office, will be able to improve further the income limits and rates of payment and further relax the residency requirements.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">We have to look at social inclusion from a holistic point of view. We cannot debate social inclusion in the House by bringing in any one Minister or any one Department. We must look at the Tánaiste's Department and at Departments which are in charge of training, budgeting and education. Rather than talking about this broad issue generally, I would like to home in on a couple of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Economics is about booms and troughs. An economy cannot continue indefinitely on an upward curve. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, while they were in Government, enjoyed a boom period. Where do these economic booms emanate from? There are various contributory factors, such as our education levels, our talented population, our industrialists and membership of the European Union. There is no single indicator. These two parties happened to be in Government during an economic boom. When you are in Government and are enjoying the fruits of a boom, there will be money in the kitty to distribute. We, as a society, did not capitalise during that boom period in terms of social inclusion and sustaining social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I wish to refer to community employment schemes, a matter not within the remit of the Minister's Department. Community employment schemes were an idea set up through FÁS to bring people off the live register, to train them in different skills and to give them confidence in re-entering the market. The last Government contributed towards these schemes when it had the money and the supervisors were dotted around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">People who came off the live register joined the schemes, gained the confidence and learnt the skills, and the vast majority of these people are employed today. However, the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, is now faced with the problem that there was no thought or foresight put into how to sustain community employment schemes. I have a meeting with supervisors in Donegal next week to discuss cut-backs in these schemes. It is acceptable to talk about what was done but the sustainability of these schemes has not been addressed. Supervisors who have mortgages no longer have jobs. People on the live register – and the number is increasing – will not now have the opportunity for training on smaller schemes. This crucial issue was not considered during the economic boom of the last four or five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Every housing estate, local authority owned or otherwise, in urban areas had a vibrant, hard working voluntary sector which helped communities by taking underage football, helping pensioners and so on. These committees and voluntary groups existed before the boom and were an asset to the country. However, as a result of the boom we have problems with our voluntary sector because during the previous Government's term in office jobs were given to the paid sector – to youth workers and co-ordinators of community development projects. These were great jobs, some of them worth €40,000 or €50,000 a year but the paid workers went into the communities and the voluntary sector began to fall apart. Volunteers questioned why they should work for nothing when others were being paid. No thinking went into the sustainability of voluntary communities in urban estates. When cutbacks begin, the first people to lose their jobs will be the paid workers in these estates so we will have not only lost the voluntary sector but the paid sector too. This is due to the lack of foresight in relation to sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Anyone who studies the basics of economics knows that it is about booms and troughs rather than what party is in power – be it Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats happened to be in Government when pensions were increased. This is hardly surprising given the economic boom. Of course Fine Gael was not in a position to hand out as much as the last Government because when that party was in Government we were in a trough. We need to be honest as political parties and stop attacking one another about the events of 15 years ago or two months ago. We need to get to grips with the realities of economics, to talk about social inclusion in holistic terms and work with all Departments in harmony – Education and Science, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs – to examine how we can make a sustainably more equal society and look to the long term rather than to this election or the next.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I thank the Minster of State for coming to the House to listen and if there is anything we, on this side of the House, can offer in terms of advice or contribution, we will be more than willing.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_483">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I welcome Deputy de Valera, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, to the House. I am glad my good friend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, could be here earlier. I congratulate her on her appointment to the Cabinet. She is a good person, a popular choice by the Taoiseach and one of the better nominations he made.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I congratulate the Government on its achievements in recent years in the area of social welfare reform and I commend the previous Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on what he achieved. As a Government Senator, it is easy for me to support the motion and to defend our record of recent years. We need only compare the Government's record to that of the rainbow Government. One example which jumps out immediately is old age pensions. In the five years of the previous Government, we increased old age pensions by 24% above inflation whereas the rainbow Government only succeeded in increasing it by 4% above inflation, so it is no wonder that when the general election was held, elderly people supported the Government parties. Indeed, they almost always have done because Fianna Fáil has always looked after the elderly throughout its history.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">We made a commitment in 1997 – which some people thought was mad – to achieve a rate of payment of £100 on the old age pension. People said it could not be done but we did it comfortably and well ahead of time. We set a new target of €200 by 2007 and we will achieve that comfortably and ahead of time too.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Massive strides have also been made in child benefit. On a per child basis, there have been increases of €25, €30 and €35 and, this year, an increase of 25% alone on what was paid out last year. Prior to that there were increases of €5, €6 and €7. We diverted money towards an area of need. We all know that money, being given for various reasons to different families, was often not being spent properly. By and large, it is mothers who receive the child benefit payments and they are now getting a meaningful amount of money each month which is, in the main, being used properly. That was often not the case previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">One of the reasons the Government has been able to do all this is that it has not cut back on the amount of money that is being spent on social welfare. Rather, it has consistently increased it in a global context because it has managed the economy so well. We were able to divert huge amounts of money away from unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit. I cannot understand what some commentators have been writing in recent days with regard to the economy – some of it bordering on hysteria. One would think we were in the depths of despair and that the entire country was about to collapse around us. That is not the case. Tax revenue is not as plentiful as anticipated – perhaps due to the success of some of the schemes that were put in place or miscalculations – but that is not to say that the economy is not fundamentally strong. I disagree with Senator McHugh's point that unemployment was on an upward spiral. Perhaps he did not see the figures that were released earlier this week which showed that the number on the live register has actually gone down.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_489">The Senator spoke about unemployment in general. The figures released earlier this month show unemployment fell in October. The current unemployment rate is around 162,000. Of that, approximately half are long-term unemployed and includes people who were on short-term contracts and other categories. It should be remembered that not too long ago 300,000 people were unemployed. We are going through a trough, but at least when we come out of it, we will be in a position to grow the economy again. We were not in a position to ride out the storm in the past, but because the economy has been so sound, we will be able to do so in the future. I do not envisage expending huge sums of money on unemployment benefit which can be used in other social welfare areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">An area in which I would like to see more money being spent is the carer's allowance. I listened on the monitor in my office to some of the contributions of Fine Gael speakers and agreed with a number of the points they made about this area. The Minister's contribution was so similar to my own notes on the subject they could have been written by her. We have made great strides in this area. I was a Member of the other House when carer's allowance was first introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods. There had not been any calls for the introduction of such a payment, but we went ahead and introduced it. It was seen as a very innovative measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">If memory serves me correctly, the budget for carer's allowance in the first year was £8 million. Everybody said it was a marvellous scheme, but within months, the very people who had not called for its introduction were attacking it and saying it did not go far enough and not enough money was being made available. Huge strides have been made since. I do not know what the current budget is, but it will have increased close to hundredfold since, particularly in recent years. The means test has been changed considerably and the impact on people lessened. More people now qualify for carer's allowance than in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I agree with the Minister that there is a case to be made for abolishing the means test because it does not make economic sense and puts pressure on geriatric hospitals. If we got the proper supports, we could look after our elderly relatives at home. The Minister agrees with this. I hope we can support her in that regard. Perhaps then it will get through to the powers that be to bring about the necessary change.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_171">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_493">I am grateful for the opportunity of contributing to this debate. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House and wish her well in her new brief. I also record my congratulations to the new Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, who will bring a great sense of passion to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">For the past three years I was my party's spokesperson on social welfare in the other House. As other spokespersons and various Ministers will testify, it is a very complicated Department because of the various schemes introduced since the 1960s. It is a case of one scheme built upon the next. The problem with social welfare policy is that it is incremental. We go into a budget process every year at the end of which we see small increases in various schemes, but we are not seeing a significant difference in the real lives of those who are marginalised, an issue about which we speak in our amendment to the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">It is a fact that consistent poverty has been reduced enormously over the past ten years by all Governments, but the major problem is that with the rise in incomes in recent years, we have seen a dramatic increase in relative income poverty. This cannot be changed through social welfare policy but through taxation and social welfare policies together. I have long argued, as have others, for harmonisation of the tax and social welfare codes. Too many people remain outside schemes because their income levels are beyond a certain limitation and, consequently, they cannot get support. We need to integrate the tax and social welfare codes. One of the ways we can do this is through the tax credits system introduced by the Tánaiste some years ago. While it was an excellent idea, we have not developed a sophisticated model in social welfare policy to direct real support to those who need it as against those who may not need it from time to time. That is a major challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The problem is one of relative income poverty and I hold the view that this is an instrument of policy that the Government has got wholly wrong in the past five years. The number experiencing relative income poverty over the past six years has increased by half the number in that category. This has been brought about, not by the changes in social welfare, but by the changes in the taxation code which have greatly benefited those at the top end of the income code. It is a detrimental policy for which we will pay heavily in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I ask the Minister to consider a number of priorities in advance of her final preparations for the budget. First, on the issue of carer's allowance, Senator Kenneally is right. Four years ago 9,000 people were receiving the allowance. That figure is now 22,000, but the problem, according to the Carers Association and the health boards, is that 110,000 are eligible for the allowance. As Senator Kenneally rightly said, we need to abolish the means test. I encourage the Minister, who is a very fair-minded person, to make this a key policy priority for carers because she will not be able to do everything over the next four years as the budgetary situation deteriorates.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Second, one of the ways we can help people's nutritional health in disadvantaged communities, some of which are in my own constituency as well as my former constituency, is through the free meals scheme. Other European Union countries have managed to put in place excellent schemes to ensure children get at least one square meal a day. The reports of the Combat Poverty Agency and various religious orders here in Dublin and other cities highlight the fact that children in some disadvantaged communities are not getting the basic nutritional value from their food. A Government sponsored free meals scheme, which needs to be amended at this stage, would help to reduce poverty in absolute terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">A particular bugbear of mine is the issue of heat. A total of 50,000 local authority homes do not have central heating.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_501">I am not feeling the cold, but, as the Minister knows well, 50,000 homes currently do not have central heating. That is a scandal in 2002. We could reduce the number for an amount €2.5 billion, which I realise is a great deal of money. A real priority for the Government should be to say that between now and 2005, every local authority house will have central heating. That is achievable and the kind of measure we should introduce to eliminate poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I ask the Minister to reform the child dependant allowance. As she is aware, there are three rates applicable. If a person is unemployed, one rate is applicable for their child while another rate applies if the person is a widow. The allowance should be reformed. I ask the Minister to examine this issue as we move forward in terms of reforming the social welfare code.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_503">Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister to the House. I listened with great interest to a number of speakers in the debate and I am delighted to make a contribution also.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I support what other speakers said in relation to carers. The Minister said she cannot abandon the means test but, as Senator Kenneally said, it does not make economic sense. Carers provide a magnificent service. The Minister should look at this issue immediately. At a time when every hospital bed throughout the country is occupied, the facility of caring for people in their own homes should be utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">An excellent service is also provided by MABS centres of which, I believe, there are 52 in total, including one in Ballina and one in Castlebar. I have been approached recently about the need for a third such centre in County Mayo to complete the coverage of this large county. There is a great need for that service because of the large number of very poor people who find it difficult to manage their limited household budgets. The demand for an additional centre is indicative of the fact that the existing centres are overworked. Undoubtedly, the experience in this regard in County Mayo is similar to that in other counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Senator Ryan referred to housing. An increasing number of people are finding it impossible to provide housing for themselves without assistance. I urge the Minister to contact the Minister for the Environment and Local Government immediately in relation to the housing strategies which had been put in place by local authorities, acting on the advice of the previous Minister in that Department. Clearly, those strategies are not working. Fewer houses are being built, not alone in the local authority sector but also in the private sector. Coming in the immediate aftermath of an economic boom, that is disastrous. Builders and developers have no hesitation in attributing blame to the strategies which local authorities have implemented on the advice of the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I again ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to contact the present Minister for the Environment and Local Government with a view to having this issue addressed. If that is not done, the situation will escalate and the Minister will be inundated with requests in relation to housing problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The motion before the House relates to what has been done over the last five years. It is not always easy to identify specific achievements of individual Ministers during their terms of office. However, going back quite a number of years, I recall the work of a former Minister for Lands, the late Joe Blowick, in laying the foundations for forestry development. A former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, introduced free transport for pensioners. A former Minister for Education, the late Donogh O'Malley, introduced free education. In the rainbow Government of recent years, the then Minister for Social Welfare, the former Deputy De Rossa, changed the pensions structure with particular reference to partial pensions. That was a major benefit for people who did not have the full requirement in contributions over their working lifetimes and were enabled to qualify for a partial pension. The former Ministers whom I have mentioned made a significant contribution to the poorer sections of society and they deserve recognition for that.</p>

        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_508">I thank all Senators who contributed to this debate and I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for her attendance. Many comments referred to the carer's allowance. While I would also like to see the means test abolished, I have to point out that the carer's allowance will cost €132.8 million in 2002 and that figure would increase significantly if the means test was abolished. The Government has considered various possibilities, such as increasing the disregard, changing the respite grants, introducing free schemes for people in receipt of carer's allowance and introducing carer's allowance to people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance. At present – and perhaps until we return to the boom times to which Senator McHugh referred – the Government's present approach represents the best use of available funds. Abolition of the means test now would result in diverting funds from other areas where they are badly needed. We have to help as many people as we can in present circumstances. While we would like to abolish the means test for carer's allowance, that is something for consideration at another time, not in the immediate future.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Senator Ryan referred to the income limit of €121 for eligibility for a medical card. With the introduction of the minimum wage, people's earnings are not as low as that. The reduction in the number of people on medical cards is due to the fact that there are more people at work. The best way towards eliminating poverty and creating greater social inclusion is through the creation of sustainable employment rather than having people depending on social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Senator Ryan also referred to MABS and to issues which he said we should not be happy with. Inequality has been reduced. The proportion of people below 60% of the average income has fallen from 15% in 1994 to 6% in 2000. That is a significant improvement and further targets have been set for the anti poverty strategy, including a reduction in consistent poverty. Senator Mansergh posed the question as to whether it is better to be absolutely better off but relatively poorer as opposed to being relatively better off but absolutely poorer. I believe most people would agree it is better to absolutely better off. It is somewhat simplistic to speak, as we sometimes do, in terms of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. That will continue to happen—</p>

          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_512">—unless we ensure that the position of the less well off in society is constantly being improved through appropriate support mechanisms. In relation to MABS, I agree with Senator Burke that it is a very useful service. However, many of those who use this service are not the very poor. In some cases, those who are very poor are better at managing their money than those who have difficulties in their homes, such as alcoholism, drug abuse or gambling. Those are the people who have difficulty managing their incomes. They often benefit from that type of service. I would like to see it expanded where possible because it does great work.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">It is ridiculous to suggest that the driving force for the increases in child benefit was the release of women to the workforce, driven by IBEC. That is the greatest load of rubbish that I have heard in the House for many years and I am disappointed that Senator Ryan said it. It is not the reason for child benefit, which is a family payment to children. It is non-means tested, untaxed and goes straight to combating child poverty. It ensures, as Senator Wilson said, that people have a choice. It recognises that some may stay at home and look after their children, while others choose to join the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I also reject the statement that the Government has done nothing about child care. We have significantly increased child care places over the past five years. We have invested in standards, training and continued improvement of child care. This is something to be proud of but there is more to be done. I welcome the progress which has been made in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">With the approval of the House, I will share my time with Senator Jim Walsh.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">My grandfather was a railway surveyor, while my great great grandfather was a member of the arbitration committee which decided on compensation in relation to the land acquisition for the Waterford-Limerick railway, and I am the only person to have received a severe reprimand for overusing the Dublin-Belfast railway. I am also committed to public transport which I use. I welcome all the investment in the railways during the term of office of the last Government, especially the rail safety programme study, and do not want to see the new Government start by closing railway lines or running down the freight service. Existing Government policy is "to maintain the existing rail passenger network" from which we should not depart.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Fianna Fáil manifesto stated the party "will ensure the advantages of rail freight will be actively encouraged and marketed." This is the policy of every party in the House and will also become Irish Rail policy because there is a larger national interest. The congestion we all experience is intolerable and should not be added to while we have an under-utilised resource. The beet trains are essential on the line in question which should be kept open. In other countries there are targets for encouraging rail freight and incentives for using it.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The proposal that eight out of 11 passenger stations in County Tipperary be closed plus four in south Wexford is outrageous. The main reason I am in this House is because of two disastrous by-elections and the people of County Tipperary are not prepared to be ignored or taken for granted by the State and its agencies. I was asked to stand in the hope of gaining more attention, which is how I came to be by various means in this House. Whether it is decentralisation, industry, radio stations or railways, the people of County Tipperary expect fair treatment and are not going to be pushed around. Clonmel is the largest inland town and, like Ennis, deserves a rail service. The rail service from Rosslare to Limerick is important for tourism. I travelled on it this summer and it has clear commuter potential. If we have trains leaving before the boat arrives and five minutes before the Dublin train arrives in Waterford, naturally we will have empty trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I do not believe the propaganda that it is costing the State €2 million to €5 million. Some ten or 12 years ago, the benefit of closing it was put at £100,000. There is an old French saying that if one wants to have one's dog drowned, call it rabid. There is much in this. Irish Rail must think again. I hope the Government will not go down this road. In hard times, there were not rail closures. Over the past 20 years the system was kept intact and must remain so now that more money is available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Mansergh. Many will remember that not so long ago CIE closed down lines much to the regret of subsequent Governments and policymakers. If these lines had at least been maintained, they would have had services reinstated. The rail line we are discussing services a catchment area that is important, not just for passengers, but also for freight. I am conscious of the economics as I have a business background in transport and rail versus road, but know that bulk traffic is ideal for rail. Beet from the Wexford area, which amounts to about 150,000 tonnes per annum, currently travels from the Wellington Bridge area to Mallow to be processed at night. This is facilitating many policy objectives which the Government wants to be adhered to. The proposal to discontinue this service does not make economic sense in the larger picture. To put this amount on the road would take over 6,000 vehicles. It represents 20% of the beet processed in Mallow and 10% of national production. It is argued that other large volume traffic on the road would also be better carried by rail. The fact that there is a 20 year strategy study in place behoves us to await its outcome. The lines and services must be preserved as far as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Irish Rail must address serious issues, not least a proper management system that would adopt innovative policies. We see what Ryanair did for air travel. On a smaller scale, similar principles could apply to the railways. What is needed is new thinking, approaches and philosophy. The system is stretched at the seams. It makes no sense to remove routes which are efficiently carrying traffic. I join Senator Mansergh in calling for this decision to be postponed and a proper, more enlightened decision to be taken.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I thank Senators Mansergh and Jim Walsh for raising this matter and their contributions. The Minister for Transport informs me that he has no plans to close any railway lines nor has he received any recommendations to date from Iarnród Éireann recommending the closure of any railway line in any part of the country. He understands the management of Iarnród Éireann is carrying out a review of the implications for its rail freight business with the closure of IFI, its third largest customer of freight services, which has resulted in serious losses in business and revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The current review of rail freight is the normal business response which could be expected from a commercial organisation responding to the loss of a major customer. It is also against a background of rail freight expected to lose approximately €14 million in the current year with the company as a whole incurring an overall deficit estimated at approximately €25 million after subvention of approximately €150 million. The Minister is informed that Iarnród Éireann is examining all major loss making areas of its business with a view to rectifying its serious financial position, but the board of CIE has not yet reached any final conclusions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Government is fully committed to the future of rail transport and has demonstrated this through significant investment in major programmes designed to improve the safety of the existing mainline rail network, increase its physical capacity to cater for growing demand and improve the quality, speed and reliability of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Earlier this year, the Department of Transport engaged consultants to undertake a major strategic review of the Irish railways. The primary purpose of the review is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail sector in Ireland over the next 20 years. The study covers both rail freight and rail passenger services and addresses urban, commuter and inter-regional rail issues. The long-term rail requirements for the country as a whole are being examined in the light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies. The review is due to be completed in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The Minister has conveyed to the chairman of CIE his view that no decision should be taken in relation to the future of the rail network until the strategic rail review has been considered.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Swimming Pool Projects.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_541">As the Minister knows, Tuam swimming pool has been listed for redevelopment since 1998. In November 2000 a new set of plans was prepared by Galway County Council with the objective of building a new pool, adjacent to the existing pool, in the palace grounds at Tuam. This led to the completion of the requisite preliminary report on the project and the submission of this report to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I asked the former Minister, Deputy McDaid, to meet a delegation from Tuam in February 2001 to discuss the proposed development and we had a positive meeting. The existing pool in Tuam, which is the second oldest pool in the Department list of swimming pools for redevelopment, was opened in 1971. Many of the local authority pools on the list have now been redeveloped yet Tuam remains in limbo. While the existing pool which has served the public well for over 30 years remains operational the public demands higher quality facilities with a greater range of incorporated activities. This can only be provided via a new development.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">My main concern is that there is now a proposal to downsize the proposed pool to one with only five lanes. It is unfair that after such a long wait the people of Tuam would not get what was promised. The extra lane was to be used for activities such as aqua fitness. I will fight for the full six lane facility. We have only one chance to get it right and this is the time to do so. All swimming pools recently approved by the Department have been approved for six lanes. The proper name for such pools is leisure centres and, as proposed for Tuam, they come with saunas, steam rooms, a gym and aerobic studios. Provincial and national swimming competitions cannot be held in the north Galway region if we have a smaller pool.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Councillor Séamus Quinn whose daughter worked in the existing Tuam pool has called for state of the art wheelchair access to the pool. I support him on this. Tuam has been highlighted as a disadvantaged area by the recent ADM report and it is now part of the RAPID programme which aims to accelerate development in disadvantaged towns. The development of a new pool in Tuam is an approved project which should be prioritised and progressed immediately under this programme. We want Tuam swimming pool to be an excellent facility. Whatever has to be done should be done and it is crucial to have the six lanes for the success of the leisure project. I plead with the Minister to give Tuam the same leisure facilities as any other town in the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_191">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_545">I thank the Senator for raising the matter and for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position in relation to the Tuam swimming pool application under the swimming pool programme which is administered by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The aim of the swimming pool programme is to assist local authorities in the development of swimming pools. However, the types of public swimming pools that were provided and accepted in the 1970s and 1980s are no longer acceptable. This is evident by the improvement in the quality of the facilities now being provided and proposed by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Under the local authority swimming pool programme there are four stages in a swimming pool project following an initial submission and approval of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are the preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project, and is capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3,809,214 are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Priority will be given to projects based in RAPID areas. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The preliminary report in respect of the pool in Tuam was approved in March 2002. My Department is currently awaiting the contract documents for the project to be submitted by Galway County Council. The proposal will be considered further on receipt of this documentation. Should Galway County Council wish to provide a six lane swimming pool in Tuam, it should bear in mind that this will add to the cost of the project and that, as already pointed out, there is a maximum grant available from my Department and that the balance of the cost of the project will have to be met by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The dimensions of the standard pool, as outlined in my Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines, specify a length of 25 metres and a width of nine metres. A pool of nine metre width, normally accommodates five swimming lanes.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">This Government has, to use the well known phrase, put its money where its mouth is in support of sport. Our commitment to the development of sport and, in particular, to the provision of sporting and recreational facilities has been demonstrated in very practical terms in all parts of the country. As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism I have secured significant increases in the funding for capital expenditure for this purpose. These increased provisions include an increase of over 800% in the overall budget for sport from €17.4 million in 1997 to €61.4 million in 2002; a fourfold increase in the annual provision for the swimming pool programme from €3.8 million in 1999 to a total of €57 million for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002; allocations under the national lottery funded sport capital programme increased from €7.6 million in 1998 to €78.6 million in 2002, an increase of over 900% and an allocation of €7.55 million towards the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick, which is due to open in the next few months. In that context I pay tribute to the previous Minister, Deputy McDaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I am anxious that the substantial investment of taxpayers' money by this Government provides value for money by ensuring that attractive, viable facilities are built. I believe that the increased levels of grant aid now available will be a major boost to local authorities in the development of swimming pools. Swimming is a sport in which most people can participate from a very early age throughout their entire lives. It is a basic, natural and efficient way of taking exercise. The national survey of involvement in sport and physical activity showed that swimming was second only to walking as the most popular form of physical and recreational activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">It is estimated that around 425,000 people participate in swimming throughout the country. Among leisure and recreational activities it is generally considered to be one of the best and most enjoyable forms of physical exercise for developing and maintaining high levels of physical fitness. It is vital that the promotion of sport and the development of facilities, such as swimming pools, is carried out in a strategic and focused way. This means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring full access to available facilities. Under the swimming pool programme, the development of pools for the future will be done in a structured and focused way, concentrating on areas of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Again I thank Senator Kitt for raising this issue and assure him that this Government will remain vigilant in providing funding for modern swimming pool facilities around the country.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - National Lottery.</heading>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I call on the Minister to intervene in the current lotto dispute. The National Lottery is downgrading up to 60 lotto terminals most of which are in rural areas. This will be a blow to the viability of these areas. My family business is a newsagents in Boyle, County Roscommon. I am a lotto agent and have first hand knowledge of how important it is for people to be able to choose their lucky numbers, such as wedding dates, birthdays, etc. My own lotto business is not at risk. It is one of the busiest in rural Ireland. It is also very lucky in that we have had three or four lotto wins.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I am making representations on behalf of people who live in rural areas in my constituency and elsewhere who want the right to choose their lotto numbers. As a result of many lotto machines being downgraded, they do not have that right, unlike citizens in towns and cities, although as citizens in rural areas, they should have the same right. They are being denied the chance to choose their numbers. It is a further erosion of the quality of life in rural Ireland. Another result of these machines being downgraded is that lotto syndicates in pubs, clubs and schools will have to travel up to eight or ten miles to larger areas to play their numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The Minister for Finance loves a flutter but is denying people in rural areas the chance to choose their lotto numbers. If the National Lottery proceeds with this disastrous downgrading which discriminates against rural areas, it will have to change its name to "The National Lottery – Almost Nationwide". Will the Minister intervene because instead of a win-win situation, it is a lose-lose situation for rural Ireland? This disastrous decision must be reversed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_558">On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I thank Senator Feighan for allowing me the opportunity to set the record straight on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">News of this matter first surfaced some weeks ago in media reports indicating that the National Lottery had downgraded some 60 lottery terminals countrywide. This is the case and it is regrettable that their number is up, so to speak. However, what may not be appreciated is that this occurred as part of an overall restructuring of the lotto terminal network. The position regarding lotto terminals and their availability following on from this exercise is much more positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">In January of this year the National Lottery carried out a review of its terminal network. At that time approximately 2,000 lotto terminals and 1,500 "instant only" or scratch card terminals were installed. In conducting this review it examined the sales levels of each of its existing terminals and also took into account the changing retail environment since these terminals were first installed. As a result, the company decided to do a root and branch job of replacing the entire terminal base of 3,500 between now and Christmas to reflect the findings of the review. In doing so, it decided to use the opportunity to improve the service levels to the player base by changing the machine type provided in certain outlets.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The 60 retailers who are the subject of this motion were originally full lotto agents, that is to say, they could offer the full range of lotto games, including the facility of entering personal choices of numbers. What has changed now is that, while lotto can still be played at these outlets, the personal option is not available. However, the "quickpick" option will be available for the full range of on-line games – Lotto, Lottoplus, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 and Tellybingo. It is also worth noting that 50% of all lotto plays are made using this facility. This decision reflects the level of activity formerly associated with these outlets which did not warrant the continuation of the more expensive option of full service.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">However, what has not been appreciated are the very positive benefits of the company's exercise, which far outweigh any negative consequences. While 60 outlets were downgraded to a certain degree as a result, on the other hand, following the review 400 agents who previously could only sell scratch cards can offer the "quickpick" option for all the on-line games I mentioned earlier. In addition, a further 100 scratch card agents have been updated to full lotto terminals offering the complete product range. The position is that while 60 outlets were downgraded, 500 others were upgraded. This upgrading and redistribution of services will significantly increase lottery coverage and, in most instances, provide a fuller range of services to a much wider area.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Some Senators may have heard the director of the national lottery, Mr. Ray Bates, give numerous media interviews explaining the rationale for this move. It is fair to say that this rationale was more or less accepted. We must also remember that the company is a commercial entity and is a source of considerable funding each year for a wide variety of worthwhile and essential projects and activities. In the current year, almost €200 million was provided from lottery funds. The more successful and cost effective the company the greater the level of funding there will be available for these purposes. This reminds me to some degree of Phil the Fluter in that, the more one paid, the more he played.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The overall position which will obtain as a result of the lottery's review not only makes commercial sense but will be much more conducive to a wider availability of the full range of lotto services to both urban and rural areas. I am glad to have had the opportunity to clarify the position. I suppose it is a question of you scratching my back and my scratching yours.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 November 2002.</p>
