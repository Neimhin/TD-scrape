#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the current position on the proposed amalgamation of St. Patrick's College and St. Jarlath's College in Tuam, County Galway.I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite the school extension project at Clonlara national school, County Clare, which is due to go to advanced architectural planning, to outline the planning, construction and development process, and to confirm that it will be included in the 2005 building programme if the budget position is adequate.I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Finance to confirm the number of persons who have applied for decentralisation to Newcastle West, County Limerick, if a property has been purchased and when the decentralisation will take place.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.I wish to correct an error on the Order Paper. No. 1 is the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2004, not 2003. I also wish to inform the House that Senator Higgins wrote to the Clerk of the Seanad on 8 October 2004 to tender his resignation as a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2004 — all Stages to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. This Bill on passing also requires an early signature motion which will be introduced by way of a supplementary Order Paper; No. 2, Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 — Committee Stage to be taken at 3.15 p.m. until 5 p.m. and if not previously concluded to resume again at the conclusion of No. 19, motion No. 13, and to conclude not later than 8 p.m; and No. 19, motion No. 13, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 3.15 p.m.Regarding the vacancy referred to by the Cathaoirleach, I propose to introduce a motion on the supplementary Order Paper at the conclusion of No. 1 to fill this vacancy as the next meeting of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is scheduled for 9 a.m. tomorrow, if that is agreeable to the House.

I appreciate the manner in which this matter has been facilitated to allow the new member to take up his or her duties at the earliest possible time.Many Fianna Fáil members were shocked to hear the comments made yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the possibility that Fianna Fáil might do a deal with the IRA after the next election.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	6	That would not be a fair question for the Leader.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I have not even asked the question yet.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	This is a matter of current controversy. I respect the leader of the Fianna Fáil group in this House, who comes from a very experienced background. Could the Leader put on the record her party's position on this issue? Most Fianna Fáil members throughout the country were shocked and disgusted to hear that their party would possibly coalesce with a paramilitary organisation after the next general election.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The issue needs clarification. I know Fianna Fáil wants to ditch the Progressive Democrats as soon as possible and produce a new partner.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The people do not want Sinn Féin in Government for a long time. Will the Leader clarify the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the earliest juncture? Good people with democratic standing need to stand up for democratic values and not woo those who have done so much harm to our country.I asked last week whether the Leader would inform the House when the Government intends to take Committee Stage of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004. She should provide this information not only because of the introduction of a Garda inspectorate, but also because of the important police partnerships that need to be set up throughout our communities.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I hope Fianna Fáil members around the country breathed a sigh of relief last night to find their leadership has found another way of staying in power after the next election, although I do not think they were that worried about it.I recently raised an issue with the Leader to which she did not reply. I interpreted this to mean she wished to get some information on it. My question referred to the Committee on Article 35.4.1° which is considering the Curtin case. The committee was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I do not doubt that its members are carrying out an efficient job in so far as they can. I am also certain they will be hung out to dry at the end of the day, although that is not important at this stage. However, there should be an interim report on the workings and processes of the committee. A statement was made yesterday by the committee but I want the situation put formally on the record. It is important that we allow the committee to get on with its business but it is also important to monitor its progress. I ask for a report and an answer on this issue.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The terms of the motion passed by the House excludes discussion on this matter.

I am not discussing the issue but the establishment of a committee, the technical issues which arise from that and the relationship of this House with the committee. I asked the Leader a question and would be happy with her response. While I will not embarrass the House, I am not prepared to forget about this for two years.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Chair is of the opinion that such matters should be left to the committee.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I look forward to the Leader's response.I am totally opposed to the points made by the new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, though I wish her well in her difficult portfolio. I remind the House that parents have won all the cases bar one taken to establish rights to special needs assistance for their children. The one case lost led the Minister to go on air to state, "Don't any of you dare take a case again or we will make sure we catch you for costs." This is frightening people who are already under pressure.If the Minister was to come to the House to tell us that any child professionally assessed to be in need of special support was receiving it, she would be right. In the event of a professional assessment determining that a child requires special needs assistance, I continue to advise parents that the only way they will get it, if not from the Department, is by going to the courts. That is the sad reality. I put two cases on the record on Second Stage of the Disability Bill and I intend to add to that on Committee Stage.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	19	On the issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes, the Irish people are in the Thirty-two Counties and a significant proportion of them have voted for Sinn Féin. If the DUP is prepared to share Government with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, the issue is not whether Fianna Fáil would do so but whether Sinn Féin would besmirch its commitment to left-wing values by joining with Fianna Fáil and keeping in power the sort of Government that has done so much damage to those it claims to support. I would put the question to Sinn Féin rather than Fianna Fáil because the latter will share power with anybody provided it has most of the power.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The other side of the House is easily provoked this morning.At the UN millennium summit in New York in September 2000 the Taoiseach stated:Today, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, I wish in this forum publicly to make a commitment to fully meeting the United Nations target of spending of 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance.Last week, the little boy he made responsible for official development assistance decided that was not a promise.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	24	That is not fair.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I agree with the Chair that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is not a little boy. I happily withdraw the remark which was a dreadful thing to say about him. I apologise to him and to anybody who was offended by it. Nevertheless, he said it was not a promise even though it was reiterated twice by the Taoiseach and it is part of the social partnership agreement and the programme for Government.I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business that we devote the first hour of business this morning to a discussion on Government policy on overseas development aid. I cannot speak for anybody else but the Labour Party will ensure the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is still finished at 2 p.m. We will accommodate this if the Government allows one hour for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who will be in the House, to articulate Government policy on overseas development aid.My assessment is that there is no Government policy, only Fianna Fáil policy and Progressive Democrats policy. The Progressive Democrats must learn that Fianna Fáil's side of the deal is to give it the tax cuts it wants while the Progressive Democrats' side of the deal is to give Fianna Fáil the expenditure priorities it wants. The Progressive Democrats has lost out. The Government has broken perhaps the most solemn commitment into which the Taoiseach ever entered. In a casual chat, a junior Minister announced it was not really a promise. They should be ashamed of themselves and some are perhaps.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I wish to highlight a dispute between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the new framework for qualifications for craft persons. While FÁS qualifications are the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, there is confusion and many people have asked me at what level the bachelor degree should be awarded. The Leader should ask whichever Minister has responsibility to come to the House to discuss this issue. It is the beginning of an academic year and it is important that the issue is cleared up.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The issue of one-off houses has been brought sharply into focus by the case of the holiday home of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. While the debate on that case is ongoing, I am aware of a young couple who, having paid €40,000 some years ago for a site, have been turned down for permission to build a house because it is classified as ribbon development near an urban community. They have lost the €40,000 and the planning permission.Over a year ago, the Taoiseach and the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated there would be changes in the approach to one-off housing. However, the guidelines in my local authority area have become even more stringent since then. As the new Minister, Deputy Roche, has stated he greatly favours one-off houses and has been in conflict with Dúchas, he should come to the House soon to outline what the approach to one-off housing will be. He should put this issue to rest and get clarification from local authorities.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Members should be careful with what they say in the House and should be conscious they will be listened to North and South of the Border. We are trying hard to create a situation whereby the DUP will be willing to enter Government with Sinn Féin. This will only happen under certain stringent conditions, including that paramilitarism ceases in all its forms. It is unhelpful to suggest that even if all that happens, that a priori on principle Sinn Féin will still be ineligible for Government. We must separate out two issues. There is the issue of eligibility to be in Government in conformity with constitutional requirements, and there is the separate issue of whether there is policy compatibility between parties that would make them want or not want to go into coalition. The parties in Government at present are likely to go before the electorate and seek re-election in two to three years time, and I believe they have a very good chance of being re-elected.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Senators should realise that this is a sovereign State, not merely a Parliament.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I raise an issue which has been causing me an enormous amount of concern in recent times. It is that despite the setting up of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to examine the activities of the banks, this body appears to be failing to police them properly. The House may or may not be aware that, although IFSRA is doing a particularly conscientious job, it is failing to detect more and more excesses by financial institutions. There is something seriously wrong with the structure that this can happen. AIB was recently involved in a case where hidden charges on a mental handicap association in Kerry were revealed at the weekend and the bank had to repay in excess of €210,000. What is worrying is not the isolated case where the bank repaid hidden charges but, first, that these were discovered by independent auditors and not by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and, second, that it is quite obvious to me and to others that this is not an isolated case and that despite legislation the banks are continually loading hidden charges on institutions not only on good charities such as the one I mentioned, but on individuals and getting away with it. It is a problem this House must attack in legislation.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	33	We cannot have a debate.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I ask the Leader to invite the relevant Minister here to review, not necessarily by way of a motion but by way of questions or statements, the progress of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and to suggest remedies for the continuing scandals, including the one involving this charity, which continue to hit the financial services sector.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It would be timely to have a debate in this House on Northern Ireland because it is very difficult for us to interact on the Order of Business on such an important issue. I recall that there was criticism in this House when the DUP emerged as the major Unionist party after the last local elections. Some of those criticisms bordered on the anti-democratic. However, if the Unionist population wishes the DUP to represent it, that is democracy. In the same way Sinn Féin emerged as the major Nationalist party in the North. What the Minister said yesterday was very balanced and unambiguous. I agree fully with Senator Mansergh that this is a very sensitive issue. There are still many elements of the peace process to be put in place. It therefore behoves us to play a positive role. I suggest not only that we have a debate soon on Northern Ireland but that we debate the issue regularly. Perhaps the Leader will consider that suggestion.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I ask for the Leader's positive and timely intervention regarding allegations of malpractice in the fishing industry in Donegal. There is a very credible fishing industry in Donegal which is the backbone of the fishing industry in this State. As its credibility is at stake, a speedy investigation is necessary. We do not want it dragged out. I ask the Leader to get in touch with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and Donegal's Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and make a timely intervention. This investigation must not be allowed to be dragged out. There are good people involved in the industry and we do not want it damaged.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I endorse Senator Ryan's comments on overseas development aid. Given the important nature of the initiative and the statements of the new Minister of State, I am sure the Leader would agree that it would be useful to invite the Minister to the House for a debate on overseas development aid, especially in light of the forthcoming budget.Senator Ryan and I would agree on many issues in this area and I greatly respect his views. However, it seems that the Minister's statements are being distorted to a great degree. He said he intended to push for a multi-annual envelope as part of the Estimates debate. I have no doubt he will succeed in that and there will be a return to multi-annual spending which was absent for a number of years primarily owing to the economic downturn.It must be remembered by the House that the Taoiseach's statement was made 12 months before the events of 11 September 2001 which had economic implications and worldwide repercussions. I do not for one moment suggest that there will be any reneging on this issue, but that the Minister of State has injected a note of economic realism into the debate. He has welcomed the cross-party support he received at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday. I am not sure whether Senator Ryan was present, but he made his position quite clear.This is an extremely important issue for this country in terms of its image. I agree with the comments that we do not do war, we do peace and we do it very well and that we do human rights and do them very well. This country has an obligation to maintain its commitments to the Third World. I am confident the Minister of State will deliver on these important commitments. However, I ask once again that the Leader give serious consideration to having an early debate on overseas development aid and this country's enormous contribution to improving the lot of people in the Third World.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I second the amendment moved by my party leader this morning.As regards overseas development aid, the Taoiseach made clear commitments not only to the United Nations but to the social partners. There was also a very clear commitment in the programme for Government. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said it was not a promise. The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot on the one hand make a commitment to a number of high profile groups to fulfil its obligations in this area and, on the other hand, get the Minister of State, after only a few days in office, to do its dirty work and announce that it was not an electoral promise. I would like clarity on that matter.Regarding the recruitment of 2,000 gardaí, there has been a debate in recent days which suggests that given the rate of annual retirement and intake in Templemore, it would be physically impossible to increase the number of gardaí by 2,000. Crime is largely confined to urban areas but the weekend before last in Dunmanway, a rural town 40 miles from Cork city, two gardaí were stabbed. Two members from the same station were viciously attacked by a gang in a village last Christmas. This station is short-staffed because of a number of retirements and transfers and the events I described are quite clearly the reverberations of the absence of Garda manpower in rural towns which is taking its toll. I would like a statement from the Leader regarding the possibility of getting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on the issue.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	41	In passing, I support Senator Ó Murchú's request for a debate on Northern Ireland. It would be timely and helpful.I raise an issue in which I have only a general cultural interest, but it touches on an important part of our national heritage. Before it is too late, will the Leader arrange a debate on the siting of a road in County Meath? There must be a way out of this. It is causing great concern to the archaeological community and to others. I wish to share with the House the words of a prominent Nationalist journalist who excoriated those who wished to put a road near Tara and claimed they would be execrated by future generations. The writer was Thomas Davis in The Nation in 1845. It has been an old problem.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I support the calls for a debate on overseas development aid. Senator Ryan was right to draw the attention of the House to this matter. However, his description of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, as a boy was not a great contribution, although the Minister is somewhat younger in years than Senator Ryan or myself.Members of all parties at the committee on foreign affairs unanimously passed a motion, in the names of Deputy Michael D. Higgins and myself, asking for the commitment to be lived up to. The matter should be approached in this constructive manner. The Minister of State spoke of having to be realistic about the issue which sounded warning bells and he did not give an absolute commitment. I wonder if it was done, like in the sophisticated manner of his father, as an attempt to get the strong backing of the foreign affairs committee, which he did get, that we must live up to the clear commitments given by the Taoiseach to the UN. There is no getting out of it. Senator Ross and I have just tabled a motion with which all Members can agree, asking the Government to live up to this commitment. There is no great difficulty in this and it will help the young Minister of State who I wish well in his task.With regard to the North of Ireland, I find myself in the uncomfortable position of agreeing with Senator Mansergh. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said that coalition with Sinn Féin would be possible if they gave up their arms, I asked myself what is wrong with that.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Can we have a debate on the Middle East? I raised this last week in the House and again at the foreign affairs committee. I am aware of a situation where schoolchildren are attacked by settlers with baseball bats and knives to prevent them from attending school. This is exactly what happened in Holy Cross. If we feel about that in the North of Ireland, we should feel about in the Middle East.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Last week Senator Lydon called for a debate on equal rights for women. The Cathaoirleach and I recently attended an IPU conference in Geneva on equal and human rights for women throughout the world. There is urgency to this debate. In Swaziland recently a female student was attacked at a bus rank by a gang of bus conductors who repeatedly raped her because she was wearing a mini-skirt. Those same conductors had passed a policy banning mini-skirts because they were distracting and encouraging lustful thoughts. If this world has not moved on and if this country in its efforts to improve the way of life for women throughout the world cannot pass some note of condemnation, then it is a sad world. I ask for a debate on equal and human rights for women in Ireland and the world.

It would be timely if progress were reviewed with regard to its supervisory role and work. All Members will agree that the Kerry Parents and Friends Association is a worthy charity and is deservedly held in high regard. I know the great work it has done over the years. It would be a sad state if it, or any other worthy charity, was ripped off by a financial institution. We should examine IFSRA's work and its role.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	55	Senator Coghlan, other Senators are offering.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Senator will be briefer today.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, sounds encouraging on the issue of one-off rural housing. I agree with Senator Finucane's call for the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister on this matter. I am sure it would be fruitful and interesting. One final matter——
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	59	No. I have to be fair to other Senators. I call on Senator Kitt.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I join in the calls for debates on Northern Ireland and overseas development aid. There was an all-party agreement on a motion supporting Ireland achieving 0.7% of GNP in overseas development aid by 2007. Some months ago, the sub-committee on development co-operation, of which I am Chairman, passed a similar motion. I hope that this all-party support will encourage the Minister of State to achieve what we all want.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	61	When the Government was seeking election to a seat on the UN Security Council, Irish diplomats went all over the world, particularly to developing countries, looking for votes. Ireland received a huge vote and was subsequently elected to the Security Council. Our commitment regarding development aid was important in securing those votes and I support calls for a debate on this issue. Recently, there was an excellent debate at the committee on foreign affairs. Further support for the new Minister of State would be given if the Seanad showed it was behind the commitment of 0.7% of GNP to development aid.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Hear, hear.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on wireless technology and the move by telephone companies to install tiny antennae on buildings such as nursing homes. It is a growing issue as more data is now transferred through wireless technology. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources must examine ComReg's budget. I understand it has already spent this year's funding and has no money for the next three months for independent audits.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister responsible for road safety to a report issued by Barnardos, an organisation which looks after the safety and welfare of children. The report was published in Belfast or London but I heard about it this morning. It has called for road safety to be enhanced by the introduction of more speed cameras not on motorways, but on roads where children are being injured and killed. Barnardos argues that such an action will be a good return on investment as it works. There has been a large increase in the number of deaths on our roads. The only time it dropped was immediately after the introduction of penalty points. However, it has increased dramatically again. We can do something about this situation.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	65	What is needed are sensible and coherent speed limits as the Minister agreed during a debate in this House. However, we still do not have them.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Senator Norris has already made a contribution.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Will the Fianna Fáil Senators make up their minds in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland? Senator Ó Murchú rightly proposed a debate on Northern Ireland moments after Senator Mansergh said we should not talk about it at all for fear of upsetting people.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I did not say that. I said people should be sensitive to what they say.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Has the Senator a question for the Leader?
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	They should get on message on this issue. My colleague in the other House, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, released information that the current rate of increase in the number of gardaí is 80 to 81 per year. How does the Government propose to square that with its commitment of 2,000 extra gardaí in its lifetime? At the current rate, it would take over 25 years to reach the figure of 2,000 extra gardaí.Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to explain his, and the Government's, seemingly renewed commitment to community employment schemes? We have heard much soft talk in recent days and I would be interested to know, as I am sure would other Members, what the Minister proposes to do to reverse the cuts in those schemes in recent years.On a related issue — it is one with which the Cathaoirleach would be familiar as a rural dweller like myself — the rural employment scheme was announced in last December's budget with much fanfare but, as of today, I understand fewer than 300 people have been employed under that scheme which was supposed to employ 2,500 farmers. What will the Government do to ensure that scheme is implemented? It made such a hullabaloo about it when it was announced last December.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Last week I asked if the Minister for Education and Science would waive the legal costs incurred by parents who unsuccessfully sought adequate help and educational facilities for their child and I very much welcome that she has done so. However, the Minister's statement yesterday, which she reiterated today, is very serious. She warned solicitors and parents not to go down the road of litigation. If the Minister believes litigation is the first call of many parents who have been put through the wringer in demanding improvements in their children's education, she is totally removed from the reality. It is important we highlight the fact the Minister said that the costs of litigation will be taken from the resources which were supposedly ring-fenced for those with special educational needs. If she is saying that she intends to waste money on litigation rather than ring-fence the resources made available for special needs under the Act, it is time she came to the House and explained herself in regard to the implementation of that legislation.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, asked if we were all shocked by the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We were not. Of all the Ministers, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is extremely precise in what he says. If one rereads or listens again to what he said, one will note what he said was that if Sinn Féin fulfilled the requirements — its democratic prowess has already been shown — it would be a consideration but only under those circumstances. That is what is important. We will endeavour to ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on Northern Ireland.Senator Brian Hayes also asked about the Garda Síochána Bill. The amendments, of which there are many, are still being processed by the Office of the Attorney General but there is a delay. It is expected that they will be sorted out and ready for debate by the end of this term. That would be helpful.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Which amendments?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	75	We have not started Committee Stage.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I know, but many amendments have been tabled for Committee Stage and they are being processed.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Are they Government amendments?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I understand amendments have been tabled all round. There is a delay but it is expected the amendments will be ready by the end of this term, which is fair enough. We should have the Bill before us this term and we will press to ensure that is the case.Senator O'Toole raised the matter of an interim report by the committee set up by both Houses to look into the Judge Curtin case. The Deputy Leader, who is on the committee, has informed me it is meeting at the moment. The terms of reference state that it will report back to the House when a report is ready. The committee does not envisage an interim report.I was asked about special educational needs, in particular the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 which we passed, and about the Minister for Education and Science's comments this morning. The Minister was particularly clear. She wants to keep money to serve the needs of people rather than spend it on litigation.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Government is challenging all the cases. It has lost every case except one. What was said this morning gives a completely misleading impression.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I thought the Minister made herself clear this morning when she replied on radio. The case which gave rise to the interview was the one where it appeared the Department would not underwrite the costs which were quite hefty.Senator Ryan brought up the matter of Sinn Féin. As stated by Senator Mansergh, Sinn Féin has a democratic mandate but it cannot fulfil it until it gives an absolute commitment, both North and South, to disarm. That is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said clearly. It is interesting what people read into one sentence rather than another. The Minister was absolutely clear. In an environment where Sinn Féin fulfils that commitment beyond any doubt, it would be eligible to sit in any parliament because it has a democratic mandate.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Government is the issue.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Senator Ryan also brought up the matter of overseas development aid and the 0.7% of GNP promised by the Taoiseach at the United Nations. He asked that we get a proper commitment on that matter. I do not mind — I do not think any of us would — what appellation he gives the Minister of State. The Senator could be called "venerable" which would be another appellation.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Senile would be another.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I would not ask the Leader to withdraw that appellation.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	85	To be venerable is very good.Senator Ormonde raised the new framework of qualifications and a seeming dispute between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science. We understand a European framework of qualifications is to be adopted by all colleges, including apprenticeships and all such gradings. The sooner that comes out, the better.Senator Finucane asked about one-off housing, local authority planning permissions and if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could come to the House to explain his thoughts on that matter. That would be useful.Senator Mansergh said the DUP has laid down conditions for entering into Government with Sinn Féin and referred to eligibility to be in Government. All parties go before the electorate from which they get their democratic mandates.Senator Ross raised the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority's failure to detect errors made by financial institutions. An independent audit discovered the recent error. The Senator called for a debate on that matter.Senator Ó Murchú said a debate on Northern Ireland would be helpful. We have made inquiries in that regard.Senator McHugh referred to alleged malpractice in the fishing industry in Donegal and called for a speedy intervention by the Minister. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has responsibility for the marine and we will request that he comes to the House.Senator Mooney referred to overseas development aid which has cross-party support. He stated that while we do not do war, we do human rights and do them well and must, in turn, make sure we fulfil our ODA requirements.Senator McCarthy seconded Senator Ryan's amendment to the Order of Business. I think he proposed we would have a debate at 2 p.m.——
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	86	It was for after the Order of Business.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I cannot get out to chase up anyone. Senator McCarthy also inquired when the 2,000 gardaí promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto would be provided. As I understand it, that measure will be put forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Estimates procedure.Senator Maurice Hayes supported the call for debates on Northern Ireland and the road at Tara. He quoted what Thomas Davis said about a road at Tara. I agree such a debate would be useful. We have all begun to receive letters about the matter and would benefit from clarification thereon.Senator Norris also called for a debate on ODA. He said we must live up to our commitment to 0.7% of GNP. He stated he would have no difficulty with Sinn Féin if it gave up its arms, which appears to be the general consensus here. He called for a debate on the Middle East, particularly as news emerges of what is being done to children as they go to school and so on.Senator Cox wants a debate on equal rights and human rights for women, a subject on which she recently submitted a report to us.Senator Coghlan referred to the Kerry Parents and Friends Association and IFSRA. Everybody knows this worthwhile charity and what it does. We would all agree with the point he made. He also concurred with Senator Finucane's comment on one-off housing.Senator Kitt called for debates on Northern Ireland and ODA. Senator Henry made the point that when we were looking for a seat on the UN Security Council we paraded our commitment to 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid and she reiterated the call for a debate on this matter.Senator Browne wants the Estimate for the Commission for Communications Regulation to be examined. He also raised the issue of antennae. A recent Act addressed the matter of the height to which antennae could be erected.Senator Quinn referred to the Barnardos report on road safety for children. I have not seen it but I will attempt to get it.Senator John Phelan referred to the promised 2,000 extra gardaí, which I already mentioned. He wants the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House regarding community employment and rural employment schemes. He alleged that less than 300 jobs have been taken up under the rural employment scheme. Perhaps that is evidence of the current high level of employment.Senator Ulick Burke welcomed the waiving of legal costs in the particular case to which the Minister for Education and Science referred this morning. We were all glad to hear that. She did not say the costs of litigation would come out of the budget for children with disabilities. She said money is tight, which it is in every area, and she does not want to see money wasted on litigation which could be more usefully deployed into the budget for children with disabilities. That is a very worthwhile aim which we would all favour. I thought the point of view she expressed on radio was extremely clear.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Senator Ryan has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: "That a one hour debate on the Government's policy on overseas development aid be taken before No. 1." Is the amendment being pressed?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Yes.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I thank the House for agreeing to deal with this short Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2004 as an urgent matter. It is fair to say it deals with an issue of concern to all sides of the political spectrum. I trust that this consensus will contribute towards speedy enactment of the proposals.The primary purpose of this short Bill is to amend the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 in order to provide a clear statutory basis for the holding of alcohol-free events and activities for young persons under the age of 18 years in licensed premises such as a nightclub or a part of a premises, such as a function room in a hotel or the main hall of a registered club, at a time when intoxicating liquor is not being sold, supplied or consumed and when physical access to intoxicating liquor is securely prevented.The position at present is that section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as substituted by section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, generally prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. The House will recall that this restriction in the 2003 Act constitutes part of the Government's response to concerns expressed both by the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the strategic task force on alcohol in regard to alcohol-related harm among young people. Until that Bill was passed, it was lawful for a 16 or 17 year old to spend all night in a pub up to closing time as long as that 16 or 17 year old did not consume intoxicating liquor on the premises. A 19 year old, therefore, could have a 17 year old girlfriend, or vice versa, on a premises and the only offence that would be committed in those circumstances would be if the younger partner in that duo consumed intoxicating liquor.A number of judicial decisions required members of the Garda Síochána, when they went into premises in those circumstances, to prove that the drinks in front of the drinkers were alcoholic. With the consumption of mixers, vodkas and orange, Bacardi Breezers and so on, it became necessary for the gardaí to first link individuals sitting at a table who were under age with a particular drink on the table and, second, show that the drink was alcoholic. At that time it was unlawful for members of the Garda Síochána to be on a licensed premises for the purposes of carrying out their duties unless they were in uniform. That meant that any public house which had a lax approach, and there were very few of them I am glad to say, to serving under age people or determining who was and was not under age had no effective policing of any kind and the law had become wholly unenforceable.On 27 May 2003, I obtained Government permission for the early drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 and I published the general scheme of the Bill on the same day. This was followed by a consultation phase during which I discussed the proposals set out in the general scheme with the licensed trade bodies and with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The proposals in the general scheme were subsequently adapted to take account of certain concerns that had been highlighted and the Bill was presented in this House on 17 June. I recall that there was a general welcome here for the proposals set out in that Bill, although some Members felt at the time that it did not go far enough.As regards the restrictions on those under the age of 18 in bars, I introduced a proposal to change the proposed 8 p.m. watershed to 9 p.m, having heard the views of Members in this House. Another issue raised here was the possible impact of the restrictions on the holding of private functions such as weddings and birthday and retirement parties in licensed premises. I also recognised the validity of those concerns and subsequently introduced an amendment providing that it shall not be unlawful for those under the age of 18 to be present in a bar on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function.Had potential difficulties with the holding of alcohol-free events in licensed premises been highlighted in the same way, I would have had no hesitation in bringing forward a suitable amendment to exclude the possibility that there would be a threat to alcohol-free events being held in clubs, pubs or nightclub premises. It is important to state that it was not the intention of the Oireachtas, when enacting the 2003 Act, to restrict in any way the activities of voluntary bodies and their dedicated and hard-working volunteers, including the No Name Club movement and people such as Eddie Kerr who have played such a part in those, or that alcohol-free alternative events for young people should not be available. On the contrary, I recall Members referring to the need to encourage young people to engage in leisure activities not involving the consumption of alcohol. I had the pleasure recently of attending the launch in Croke Park of the No Name Club's promotional video and I express and record my admiration of the work being done by that organisation, and similar bodies, throughout the country.Shortly after the entry into force of section 14 of the 2003 Act at the end of September 2003, concerns were expressed by certain youth organisations that the restrictions provided for in section 14, while generally welcome and justified in terms of combating alcohol-related harm among young persons, could have the effect of interfering with the holding of alcohol-free events for persons under the age of 18 in premises licensed for the sale of alcohol. There is nothing to prevent such events being held in non-licensed premises such as school halls or community centres but I readily accept the point which has been made by the organisers of alcohol-free events that the holding of such events in the local sports club's premises or hotel function rooms increases their appeal, for obvious reasons, to young persons because of the comfortable surroundings, lighting, special effects, etc.The same question arises in relation to sports activities, gymnastics or dancing classes that are taking place in the function room of a sports club after 9 p.m. if there is a bar at one end of the room which is shuttered. It was never my intention, and never the intention of anybody in this House and nobody ever suggested it at the time, that we were in danger of making illegal the presence, for example, of ten year old children at an Irish dancing class in the local GAA club because the function room had at one end of it a bar with the shutters down. We thought at that time that nobody in their right mind would have thought that was the effect of the definition of "bar" and the particular prohibition.Arising from the concerns expressed about the possible negative impact of the 2003 Act on the holding of such events, legal advices on the operation of such events were obtained by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from one of the country's leading experts in licensing law. The conclusion the Department's counsel reached — a conclusion with which I fully agreed then and still agree — was that where licensed premises or a part of such premises are not being used for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor and the bar counter is closed, such premises do not constitute a bar for the purposes of the 1988 Act. I made this information public on 4 November 2003 in the context of a reply to a series of parliamentary questions which related to the subject. The advice I received was that to have a judo class, an Irish dancing class or whatever in the function room of a GAA club when the bar at the other end of the room was locked with shutters was not unlawful.More recently, the issue was again raised in the context of alcohol-free events planned to celebrate the release of junior certificate results. Members of the Garda Síochána were telling the organisers of such events that they could not hold them in any place, even if there was a shuttered bar in the area. I understand the Garda Commissioner consulted the Attorney General on that occasion who advised, while making clear that he has no function in relation to prosecutions but that he does have a function in regard to licensing law, that in his view the provisions in question did not prohibit those under the age of I8 from attending alcohol-free functions in a portion of a premises in which the bar had been physically closed and was not being used for the sale or consumption of intoxicating liquor.I am also aware, however, that the Director of Public Prosecutions who, since the Act of 1974 came into force, acts independently of Government and the Attorney General in regard to the prosecution of offences, has directed that prosecutions be taken in certain cases where alcohol-free events have been held on licensed premises in the circumstances I have just mentioned. As far as I am aware, no prosecution brought by the DPP has succeeded. Indeed, I have seen details of a case in County Galway where the District Court dismissed the charges on hearing that alcohol was not available from the bar and that the shutters were down. Media cases indicate that other prosecutions along the same lines were equally unsuccessful in other District Courts.It is possible for people to have different interpretations of the law and subject to a final determination of the meaning of any statute by the Supreme Court, there will always be room for different views on what is actually the law. All I can say is that the expert counsel available to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General's office and a number of members of the District Court Bench have taken the view that an offence was not committed in the context of having such an event in a licensed premises.The problem is that if the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent of the Attorney General, decides that he intends to prosecute or to take one view of the law, I then have to examine this and ask whether it is fair for me to hold out one view of the law and for the Director of Public Prosecutions to operate on another view of the law and to have people who are trying to organise these events effectively put in the position of being guinea pigs in a legal experiment where one person may or may not be proven to be correct. In those circumstances everybody in this House would, notwithstanding the fact that the Judiciary, so far, the Attorney General and expert counsel available to me takes one view, feel it is appropriate to remove doubt so that the people who want to use GAA halls for Irish dancing classes and so on do not find themselves prevented by one interpretation of the law from so doing. The situation that has developed is very unsatisfactory and needs to be resolved urgently. The definition of bar which is that set out in section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 serves several different purposes in that Act. I intend to adopt a somewhat different approach, including new definitions of bar and bar counter in the codification Bill to which I will refer later. Bar has three colloquial meanings — the physical counter over which drink is sold; the room in which that activity takes place and the profession of which I am a member. It is unfortunate that a single definition embraces the physical counter and the room.

There are several things it could cover. Tommy Cooper used to tell a joke about walking down the street and running into a bar and saying "ugh" because it was an iron bar. There are many definitions of the term "bar" but we will stick to the more colloquial ones. In this context we will deal with the two meanings which most people would accept, namely, the object against which one leans with a pint in one's hand and the room in which that activity might take place.I recognise that the lack of a clear provision in statute law which would permit the holding of alcohol-free events and activities in parts of licensed premises in stated circumstances has created uncertainty. This uncertainty has resulted in understandable caution on the part of organisers of such events and the licensees on whose premises they are held. Given the DPP's view, if one owns a pub in which there is a nightclub or disco or one is the committee chairman of a GAA or rugby club or whatever, and is asked to make a room in the premises available for young people to carry out an innocent activity, not involving the consumption of alcohol, and if one knows the consequence of being prosecuted, one will be told to steer clear of this activity while there is legal uncertainty around the issue. In theory, running such activities could result in forfeiture of one's licence. The purpose of this Bill is to remove such uncertainty. The importance of alcohol-free alternative activities for young people is appreciated here and beyond this House. It was recently highlighted again by the National Crime Council, the National Children's Advisory Council and the strategic task force on alcohol, in its second report launched on 22 September.Section 1(1) provides that for the purposes of section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, it shall not be unlawful for a licensee to allow a person under the age of 18 years to be on a licensed premises, or part of a licensed premises, at a time when intoxicating liquor is not being sold, supplied or consumed there and physical access to intoxicating liquor on those premises or part thereof is securely prevented. I accepted an amendment in the Dáil which replaced a reference in section 1(1) to the bar counter being closed with the reference to access to intoxicating liquor being securely prohibited. This revised formulation is based on an argument made by Deputies Costello and English that while the shutters are down in a hotel function room where an alcohol-free disco is being held for kids, one might want to be able to use the sinks, glasses and all the material needed for the service of minerals.I was also conscious that, on one view, even if one closed that bar and brought a table into the function room, it would constitute a bar counter because the definition of "bar counter" is a counter across which drink of all kinds is sold. I was persuaded by the argument that it would greatly enhance the attractiveness of such premises at those kind of events if one could use the sinks, microwaves and paraphernalia behind the bar for the service of minerals, provided that alcohol was securely locked away on the occasion and the rolling up of the shutters was entirely innocent, with no question of alcohol being available. That will be the case in future if this Bill is passed. The revised formulation will permit the bar counter to remain open, provided that physical access to intoxicating liquor is prevented, for example, by removing all intoxicating liquor from that portion of the premises or making sure that it is completely locked up.Section 1(2) provides that for the purposes of section 34A of the 1988 Act, which requires persons aged at least 18 years but under the age of 21 to have an age document with them in order to be in the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m, it shall not be unlawful for the licensee to allow such a person who has not produced an age document to be on licensed premises in similar circumstances. It would be manifestly absurd to say that the trainer of the judo class should have in his possession a card showing his age just because there was a bar at the end of the function room of the local sports club.Section 1(3) provides that for the purposes of sections 33 and 34 of the 1988 Act, it shall not be unlawful for a person under the age of 18 years to be on licensed premises in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (1). Section 1(4) provides that for the purposes of section 34A of the 1988 Act, it shall not be unlawful for a person aged at least 18 years but under the age of 21 who does not have an age document with him or her to be on the licensed premises in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (1).Section 1(5) provides a defence for a person charged with an offence under the relevant sections of the 1988 Act. Section 1(6) makes it clear that nothing in this Bill shall prevent a person raising any point of law or other plea or objection which would be open to a person to raise in proceedings under the relevant provisions of the 1988 Act. Section 1(5) is designed to afford to people in a bar in the circumstances I mentioned in the past where the shutters were down, a defence in line with the advice I received from counsel, and the view of the Attorney General and the District Court at the time.Section 1(7) was inserted by way of a Committee Stage amendment in the Dáil. It takes account of concerns expressed about the impact of the 9 p.m. watershed on family holidays. Last year as a result of our debate in this House we moved the watershed for young people in pubs from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. It is open to a publican to exclude young people at any time from his or her premises. This is not mandatory in terms of establishing a minimum; it is merely where the criminal law prevents people from having children in pubs. It was suggested to me that the time limit be extended to 10 p.m, the daylight hours in the summer from May through September. This should deal with the arguments about the tourist season and people coming in from the beach that we heard in public discourse.By the same token I must deal with the fact that not every tourist in Ireland is in a tourist area. This applies in Temple Bar, Finglas, Donnybrook and areas which are not considered tourism haunts generally and is an across-the-board rule. I cannot operate on the basis that everywhere is equivalent to a beach-side bar on the Atlantic coast on a glorious summer evening. I must also deal with the fact that it could be a rainy day in Temple Bar. Whether there should be children in the bar at nine or ten o'clock is an issue on which most people have some proper concerns.This threshold is intended to operate as a time after which 16 and 17 year olds are effectively barred from pubs because they will not be able to produce their evidence of age cards and, therefore, cannot spend all night in pubs which was the situation and would remain so if we did not set a time by which they must leave the premises and go home. We must have certainty from the point of view of the licensees in this matter too. It is not a case of my advocating a nanny state. Some members of the Opposition suggested that the mandatory age cards should be given to 18 to 25 year olds or 18 to 23 olds, but I considered 18 to 21 to be the smallest band for which those cards could be reasonably requested. If we are to have a mandatory card regime for that age group we must have a threshold as it is not possible to rely on young people being in a bar and having a sandwich as an extension of the normal lunchtime bar trade. This is why in any system, which has a mandatory age requirement, some form of threshold must exist. Otherwise children would be unable to go to a bar at 4 p.m. and have soup and sandwiches. We must have some time when that is lawful and some time when it ceases to be lawful for 16 and 17 year olds to be in a bar having soup and sandwiches. This explains the background to the threshold.Senators will be aware of the intention to move before the House an earlier signature motion for the Bill. This is urgent legislation in view of the pressing need to remove the current uncertainty regarding the holding of alcohol-free events and activities for under-18 year olds on licensed premises and in view of the situation in which I find myself whereby if the Director of Public Prosecutions directs the Garda to enforce the law as he sees it, people will be summoned and brought before the courts. The Government considered it appropriate to seek the prior concurrence of this House in a request for earlier signature of the Bill by the President.I want to say a few words on the subject of codification of the intoxicating liquor code. Codification of the licensing laws was first recommended by the Royal Commission on Liquor Licensing Laws in 1899 and this recommendation has been repeated during the intervening period by Government-appointed commissions of inquiry in 1925, 1957 and again in 2003. I am happy to tell the House that I have done what has been sought for 100 years.We have prepared the scheme of a Bill to codify into a single statute all licensing laws, from off-licences to on-licences, from theatres to nightclubs and across the board covering the sale of alcohol in every circumstance. The scheme of the Bill is before the Government and a number of interested Ministers are considering the scheme with a view to making a final decision in November. When this is approved by Government it will be published for consultation and moved in the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be thereafter. It will replace with one Bill the licensing Acts and all statutes relating to the sale of drink, which number approximately 100, and simplify and modernise the law in this area.The Bill will, in particular, include updated provisions relating to public houses, off-licences, hotels, nightclubs and theatres. It will also contain provisions on the supply of intoxicating liquor in registered clubs which will replace the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2003. It is radical and far-reaching legislation. At the time we debated the 2003 Bill I said we would introduce the codifying Bill. It is now with Cabinet and will be published in the near future. I ask this House to bridge the gap between now and the passage of that Bill, when we can deal with the definition of bars to our hearts' content and agree to the nth degree issues such as what constitutes a bar or a function room. While we can do all those things in the very near future, we have one moment of urgency in that century-long process of codification, which requires that people in these circumstances should not be prosecuted on the basis of a differing opinion of law among expert lawyers as to the meaning of the 2003 Act. In that context, I commend the Bill to the House and thank Senators for agreeing to take it as a matter of urgency.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I welcome the Minister to the House. The problems which teenage discos faced arose from section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, introduced by the Minister. Since the commencement of this section on 29 September 2003, teenage discos started to experience problems and many of them have closed. Since that date the Minister has been assuring everybody that no problem existed with teenage discos and that everything was fine. At the same time teenage discos were being raided by the Garda and closed down. The Minister continued to assure us that his interpretation was right and that everybody else was wrong.Section 14 is clear. If a person under 18 years of age is in the bar of a licensed premises at any time, then an offence is committed. It makes no difference whether the bar is open or shut or the shutters are up or down, the section is very clear. It is beyond my comprehension how the Minister could assert that teenage discos would be unaffected.The belief that section 14 would have serious implications was first expressed by my party colleague in 2003 when the Bill was debated. The Minister stated that had this been highlighted at the time he would have immediately amended it. However, it was highlighted and I quote from my colleague, Senator Feighan, who pleaded with the Minister saying "if this measure gets rid of the confirmation and communion discos, the Minister should reconsider." However, the Minister did not reconsider and has persisted to this day in stating that he is right and that this Bill is not needed. The Minister issued the following statement on 10 September 2004:The Attorney General has this afternoon advised the Commissioner that section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 does not prohibit children from attending alcohol-free functions in a portion of a premises in which the bar has been physically closed and shuttered and which is not being used for the sale of intoxicating liquor.The Minister had previously sought and obtained legal advice on the matter and had informed the Garda that section 14 did not have the effect of rendering such premises unusable for alcohol-free entertainment of teenagers and children.The Minister very much welcomes the Attorney General's advice on the matter and that the situation has now been clarified.That was one month ago. The present situation is completely unprecedented. The Minister is now proposing a Bill he believes to be unnecessary. He is backed up by the Attorney General who believed it was not necessary. The Opposition welcomes the Bill with open arms, as we believe it to be necessary as Senator Feighan highlighted in the debate last year. If the Bill is not necessary, why are we debating it?The Minister's statement of 10 September was a desperate attempt to clear up the mess he made in 2003. Nothing he or the Attorney General says can wipe out what is contained in the legislation in 2003. The legislation was clear and the Minister put the Garda in an impossible position having been presented with a law requiring it to close teenage discos. On the other hand the Minister was telling the Garda that its interpretation was wrong. It was not until Constance Cassidy confirmed she was preparing a challenge to the legislation that the Minister's bluff was called and he finally agreed he was wrong. Publicans acted in good faith on the basis of the Minister's assurances that teenage discos were permissible and now find themselves being prosecuted for allowing such discos. The whole situation is a complete and bizarre mess.The Bill does not deal with another matter of considerable importance, namely the anomalous legal position whereby nightclubs have to operate under exemptions, extensions and theatre licences. It must be addressed now, rather than next year or the year after. The Minister should recognise that nightclubs are not pubs. For many years, they have been allowed to open only at the mercy of the courts, which can grant them extensions and exemptions. Some clubs have been operating under theatre licences. Following decisions taken by the Dublin licensing court, the courts and the Garda have been forced into the invidious position of having to determine justice policy. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he will make the necessary changes in the codifying Intoxicating Liquor Bill. The Government promised in past legislative programmes that the codification Bill would be introduced. According to the most recent legislative schedule, the Bill will not be brought to the Houses until next year, at the earliest. This issue needs to be addressed with the same urgency as the Bill before the House today.It would be remiss of me not to refer to the Minister's acceptance, in effect, of a Fine Gael amendment in the Dáil last week. The amendment proposed the relaxation during the summer months of the ban on children in public houses after a certain time. Children will now be allowed to stay in pubs until 10 p.m. during the summer months. The new provision, which is a victory for common sense, will enable holidaying families to enjoy meals and outings together during the summer months until a reasonable hour. The Fine Gael amendment represented a reasonable compromise that will facilitate holidaying families, vintners and hoteliers. I hope we will be able to look forward to an improved tourism season next year as a result.As I said, the Fine Gael Senators will support this Bill, as amended. The Minister and the Attorney General said a month ago that the Bill was not necessary.

#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House. I also welcome the minor amendment which has been made to the Bill, which is important, as the Minister has said. I am glad that the Minister has not been lambasted in this House for rushing all Stages of the Bill through in one day. I listened to some of the Dáil debate on the Bill, during which the Minister was criticised for dealing with the Bill so quickly. Of all the Ministers who come to the Seanad, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, cannot be charged with trying to rush through legislation in any way. He painstakingly discusses each minute detail of every Bill. After the Minister has debated a Bill in the House, all Senators understand it thoroughly because we have been immersed in it.The primary purpose of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2004 is to provide for the giving of clear statutory notice of alcohol-free events in licensed premises where alcohol is not being consumed to people under the age of 18. Such events can be held in hotel function rooms or other licensed premises. The Minister has said that before last year's legislation was introduced it was possible for children to stay in pubs until closing time, at 11.30 p.m. or midnight. In retrospect, it was an outrageous situation. It is no wonder this country's culture of using and abusing alcohol was allowed to develop in such circumstances. The Minister reminded us that it was quite possible for a 16 year old girl who dressed up well to drink to her heart's content in a pub with a crowd of people aged 19 or 20 without the fear of legal sanction. A non-uniformed garda does not have the right to enter a licensed premises. I imagine that gardaí who enter such premises in uniform might as well have a beacon over their heads. It was quite difficult to prove that a 17 year old was drinking the alcoholic drink in front of him or her. I am glad the new legislation will bring an end to such problems.When the 2003 Act was being passed by the Oireachtas, I appreciate that the Minister did not intend to impede in any way the activities organised by certain voluntary bodies which do some fine work. It is important that the effect of this Bill is clarified for such organisations so that they do not have to second-guess the legislation. They should be able to pursue their good deeds, such as looking after the youth of the country. Similarly, a lack of clarity is a problem for some good people in the industry who provide space on their licensed premises to allow voluntary organisations to hold beneficial events for young people. Such people should not be subjected to prosecution as a result of ambiguity. I hope that the uncertainty which has surrounded this area since the 2003 Act was passed will be removed today.As the Minister said, a certain amount of urgency was needed in this area because the DPP, the Minister and the Attorney General were at odds about the interpretation of the 2003 Act. There was a possibility that the DPP planned to instruct the Garda to bring prosecutions. I think the Minister mentioned that such a prosecution has been pursued in Galway. Such ambiguity needed to be attended to in the circumstances. It would have been inappropriate for all the good works I have mentioned to have been exposed to prosecution.The Minister can be proud of the focus he has brought to bear on this issue since he came to office. As I have said, it is essential that children aged 13, 14 or 15 should not have absolute access to public houses. If I go into certain public houses in my constituency on a particular pay day, I will see children with school bags running around with crisps and orange. Their older brothers and sisters can be found on the same premises after 9 p.m. on the same day. I do not claim that such behaviour is unique to people in the lower strata of society. I am sure similar scenes are evident at the house parties of the rich and famous. Young people are often initiated by having their first alcoholic drink in front of their parents at such events. The drinking culture is embedded in that way and we are all to blame in that regard.The Minister has been accused on a number of occasions of running a nanny state. Somebody will have to stand up and be counted if we cannot solve these problems by means of the educational system — I appreciate that we have not really started trying to do so to any great extent, if parents are not prepared to look after their children, for example by knowing where they are at all times, or if certain publicans are not prepared to look beyond their profit margins. The Minister happens to be prepared to stand up and be counted at present. For what it is worth, I think he is doing a fine job by introducing legislation and bringing a focus to this area. I may have heard the Minister say in the past that rather than legislating in this way, he would prefer alcohol to be made more widely available in different settings, such as coffee shops and pizza parlours. The Minister would like to change the environment in which alcoholic drink is consumed, so that people do not automatically stand at bar counters getting blasted, as they do. A new drinking environment and a different culture can be created, one in which food rather than alcohol is the predominant feature.A survey on alcohol and drugs conducted in schools in 2000 showed that Irish 16 year olds are among the highest abusers of drink or binge drinkers in Europe. One in four reported having been drunk on ten or more occasions in the year in which the survey was carried out. A more recent report on health behaviour in schoolchildren showed that in under-15s the incidence had reduced, but there was no change in the drinking patterns of 15 to 17 year olds in 2002. In the 12 to 14 age group, 16% of boys and 12% of girls were current drinkers and for the 15 to 17 age group, 60% of boys and 56% of girls had experienced serious drinking.It is in that context that the Minister is legislating, He must do so and there is no doubt that, as a nation, we have lost the run of ourselves regarding drinking. When young people go out at weekends, they do not have a social drink but get absolutely smashed, to use their own expression, and we must do something to confront that problem. Unless we can cope with this as a matter of urgency, we will see a whole generation of children brain dead, with liver damage or deaf as a result of the serious implications of loud music in discos. There is pressure on our health services, but if the situation worsened, it would have serious implications. Parents must be much more vigilant. It is one thing to make laws and another to impose them and ensure compliance. If parents do not know where their children are at night and are not prepared to take responsibility in that regard, it is quite unfair to expect teachers in schools or anyone else to look after their children for them.It is not just a youth problem. We all bring something to the table when it comes to alcohol abuse. For example, my age group has probably been the slowest to adapt to the drink driving laws, primarily because we grew up with a culture of doing so and it is the hardest habit in the world to break. It is also hard for children exposed to drink at a very early stage in their lives to change their habits as they grow older. A much greater focus is being put on the extent of alcohol abuse and society is now aware of the fact that drink is probably the greatest torment of all, leading to thuggery and abuse. A Public Order Offences Act 1994 survey conducted between 1996 and 2002 found that there was a 160% increase in the amount of disorder caused by drunkenness. That is an indictment. The Minister must continue the fight and has our full support in that regard.

I have no difficulty in supporting the Bill and I look forward to doing so. I cannot resist the temptation of having a little swipe at those who drafted it in the first place. They got part of it wrong and this is about the fifth occasion in the course of this year that we have had to deal with emergency legislation. I find draftspeople very inflexible — I do not mean the Minister but the drafting — and this is a classic example.On that point, perhaps I might ask the Minister a question which I know is the last thing he would wish to hear at this stage. I notice that he accepted in the other House the change to the words "physical access". When I read the Bill, I found that phrase kept jumping off the page at me. There is something wrong with that wording, but the Minister has accepted it and I can see why. It is certainly better than what was stated originally and I accept the argument in its favour. However, I am not sure. It is almost as if someone were tied down. The drink would be over there, with me tied up here so I could not move. That is the sort of impression that I get. It is like a comedy.

However, it is right for the reasons outlined. It was a sensible interpretation from the Minister and a pragmatic one from the Attorney General. I can also understand the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions and how his office viewed the matter. I support the Bill.I would like to cover some broader issues. The Minister will be aware that recently there was a report from the task force on alcohol. I know that it is not his Department, but it impinges so much on it that I would like to make a few points about it. I am not sure whether I tabled a motion, but I certainly sent a note to the party leaders in this House over the past week seeking agreement for a debate which would examine the recommendations of the task force, implementation, current Government thinking and how we might move matters on.Some of the proposals are revolutionary, especially that there should be an increase in excise duty. I firmly believe that, with current market forces, a pint will be down to €3 within the next six months. I am not sure whether Senator Bohan will be glad of my input on that issue. That will be extraordinarily good news for the Government, which should pick up the slack through excise duty. I listened to my erstwhile colleagues in IBEC recently trying to give two messages at the same time. On national radio and television, they tried to say we should reduce the price of drink to save the drinks industry, while at the same time ensuring that people do not drink too much. Perhaps someone might riddle me that one. I could not understand what they were saying and played it back, but it did not work. We must grasp the nettle on this question.However, there are also other issues. I have thought long and hard about young people. I know the Minister has been sniggered at for saying this, but I too regret the fact that we do not have a developed café society in this country, something that I have said to him many times.

However, I notice when I am abroad over the summer that people, including young people, meet outside where there are always things to do. We will never match that but there are things we could do. I wish to put one proposal before the House in the next fortnight. Let us consider what we can do at night. We are always told that there is nowhere to go except the pub and we all play a part in that regard. However, how many public buildings are open after 6 o'clock? How many museums, art galleries, zoological gardens and other places that people might visit are open? They are all closed and that is also a good reason for us to support theatre. There is a great demand coming through at present for us to do so.This is not off the top of my head. I have examined this very carefully in other European countries. There is a view there, and a discussion is currently ongoing in the UK, that it would be a good idea to open public buildings so there might be another place to go, even if it were merely a matter of where people meet. The only place for people to do so is the pub. We all do it and I see nothing wrong with that. I know that some people would argue that we should have more alcohol-free outlets. I do not feel strongly about that; I have no problem with alcohol being available. However, there should be places where one does not go only to consume alcohol. That is what we should consider and I ask the Minister to examine that suggestion.There is another conflict with which I cannot deal. I have said many times in this House that there should be no regulation of licensing laws. I now believe that I was wrong to say so. It is my fervent belief that people should be old and mature enough to be able to buy and sell alcohol at any given time, and in a perfect society that would be the case. However, there is now indisputable evidence, against which I cannot argue, that greater access leads to greater consumption. That is now absolutely definite after what we have seen over the last few years and I regret it. One cannot deal with drugs or alcohol on the supply side; it must be on the demand side. That begs the question of how we educate people that there are other things to do and that it is all right to go somewhere without having a drink. The vintners' lobby should be encouraged. It is good to see more coffee machines in public houses, but there are still a fair few in which one is looked at askance if one asks for anything hot, and that could be a hot whiskey or port as much as a hot coffee or tea.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I make that point because pubs should be required to have such alternatives available. The profit on them is high and many smart publicans can see that. It should be as easy to get a cappuccino in a public house as a pint of stout. Those other options should be available and we must move onto them to get things going. I agree with the point that the Minister has made many times that the "superpub" is not a pub at all. Smaller pubs in local areas are far more attractive. Recently, more and more village nuclei are being developed in housing estates on the outskirts of Dublin. These natural developments allow local people to watch local kids drinking in local areas, which has its own built-in restraints. That is how it worked in the old days. Without cars, people could not travel very far, and therefore went to the local pub. Everyone could watch them drinking there, even if they pretended not to, so there was a community restraint or inhibition. We now miss that.Members of both Houses need to be better educated. I do not purport to know a lot about this subject, despite the substantial portion of my life spent in public houses, which I will continue to frequent. We need to inform ourselves better regarding the attitudes taken by young people. The issue should not simply be about making it more difficult to get drink by restricting opening hours and outlets. Those methods must go hand in hand with a sensible approach to demand. We must educate people so that they will know there is more to life than drink, although drink can be part of life. That balance must be achieved. We should not go over the top on either side. It should not come down to the cause of zealots being opposed to the cause of the vintners. The answer lies somewhere in between.The vintners' lobby is entitled to make a strong case. I have no objection to that, but the vintners got the smoking issue all wrong. Had they moved properly on that issue, they could have got a compromise from Government at the time. They did not do so and now face difficulties. The same is true of this Bill. The vintners should be, and in many cases are, supportive. On many occasions I have heard Senator Bohan make the case for responsible drinking.The opening of public buildings which are not designed primarily for alcohol consumption should be considered by the Government. Regarding demand, we must ensure that a fun time can be had without alcohol and that people understand that. We must educate people so they understand they do not need to drink all the time, that there is nothing wrong with having a few drinks, but that one should always be in control. In a far distant age, when I was a young man, it was considered to be a mark of inferiority if one could not hold one's drink. In the current climate it seems it is a mark of inferiority if one does not get so drunk that one falls about the place. We must find our solution within those two positions.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I am grateful to my colleague, Senator O'Toole, for sharing his time. The Bill the Minister is introducing is, in effect, an amendment to an earlier Bill. He is considering two issues, namely, the extension of the exclusion time for young people from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. and the re-definition of the bar area so that functions can be held for young people in an alcohol-free area even though it may technically be part of a licensed premises. Few of us can have much difficulty with that. When the original Bill was going through the Houses, I recall that the time mentioned was 8 p.m, which was extended in this House to 9 p.m. The fact that the Minister accepted an amendment from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in the Lower House, and is now extending the time to 10 p.m, shows his open-mindedness. That is a very healthy example of participatory democracy.It would be ludicrous if the effect of the Bill were to prevent teenagers dancing in an alcohol-free environment, which is not what either House of the Oireachtas intended. The Garda moved very quickly into this area and indicated to a number of sporting venues, including Old Wesley rugby club in Donnybrook, to which I belonged for a while and which holds regular dances, that prosecutions could be initiated against it if, for example, it ran a disco to celebrate the end of the leaving certificate examination. This was despite the bar being locked and no alcohol being available. That looks like nit-picking and was not the intention of the Oireachtas.This debate has highlighted the need for appropriate venues for young people. I live in Dublin's north inner city, which remains quite a troubled area with regard to unemployment, drugs and alcohol abuse, etc. One of the best developments in the area was the opening of a playground in Gardiner Street. It is really terrific. The community now has a facility which gets kids, young people and the young immigrant population off the streets and playing together.It is a reproach to this country that in so many towns, the only places available for social functions are pubs. With the greatest respect to my friend, Senator Bohan, and the decent publicans, a pub is not an entirely appropriate environment for young people. There is the reek of drink, glasses about the place and advertisements for booze-ups on the wall. Among the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol are the regulation of availability and control of the promotion of alcohol. There is an insidious promotion of alcohol in the pub environment. I have never thought it a proper environment for children. I accept that when people are on holidays in hotels it may be a little tough to separate out people under 18 from their parents, and we are right to consider that.A couple of weeks ago I listened to a programme on traditional Irish music. Those involved were bellyaching about the situation. They were talking about "our Irish culture", which seemed to be confined to drinking, and suggesting that our music could only be heard in pubs. We should ask whether the core of our culture is merely drinking. If it is, we are in trouble.Other countries can cope with the situation. Luckily and happily, I spend part of my time in Cyprus. There are no bars there, except in places like Ayia Napa and Limassol, and indeed there are very few in Limassol. One can go to the kahvehane, the village coffee houses. No one thinks any less of one if one has a coffee, which is what most people have. One can have a beer, a zivania or a brandy, but there is no pressure to drink all the time. We must address this issue and be prepared to spend money on providing youth clubs, sports centres and recreation centres as an alternative, so people are not channelled into thinking that the most natural and most Irish idea in the world is to drink.Senator O'Toole also raised the question of licensing. It is not directly referred to in the Bill but I cannot resist the opportunity to refer to it. I have spoken at length about superpubs and the licensing laws. It is important, for example, that the Garda be proactive. It seems to me, although I am ready to be corrected, that pub licences are more or less automatically renewed and that pubs are investigated only if there is a complaint. That is not good enough. There are a number of lousy pubs within a cuckoo's spit of my house. I could name them, but would not abuse the privilege of this House — at least not yet. There should be a pub checklist with regard to health and safety. This would also protect decent publicans. Drugs are openly on sale in some pubs and in others very dangerous physical fights take place, sometimes involving weapons. It is not right that the proprietors of those pubs should automatically have their licences renewed. Quite often, people are reluctant to make complaints because those complained about are so dangerous. The Garda should be asked whether a clean bill of health can be given to a pub. It is fairer on judges because they sometimes give licences to venues that should not have them.We should get rid of the hypocrisy. What is meant by "special" extensions and "special" licences? I know of pubs which get 30 of these per month, which is daft. Either the extension is "special" or it is not. We must consider this realistically and try to control the situation.I am not anti-drink. I enjoy a drink and enjoy getting slightly tight on appropriate occasions, particularly with a good meal in the mountains of Cyprus, which is heaven. I enjoy wine and make no apologies for it. However, I behave reasonably and decently and do not drive my car when drinking.

I am not rabidly anti-drink or against decent pubs. Pubs give great pleasure, particularly old style pubs where one can have a civilised conversation and not have one's ears split open.I will conclude with an example. A pub with a beer garden on Parnell Street obtained a special extension. Elderly residents lived nearby but, due to the equipment being used at the pub, the noise would shatter the glass in Busaras. I complained and eventually got the sound turned off by saying I would object to the pub's licence on the basis of its disgraceful behaviour. It is not right that elderly residents were terrified by noise and although this was not the correct environment for the young, the pub intended to attract the young.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I welcome the Minister and the Bill. We are again discussing drink, an issue we have discussed on countless occasions in the past two years. When I was a child, the famous statue of Fr. Matthew was just two miles from my house in County Tipperary. I was often told of the evils of drink when passing the statue. I was told Fr. Matthew was heading for perhaps Cashel or Dublin and was pointing in a direction away from Tipperary.At a time when volunteerism is at an all-time low and when attempts are being made to organise alcohol-free teenage discos, it is disturbing the Minister must introduce emergency legislation to ensure that such events continue. I am particularly alarmed that after centuries of drink consumption in Ireland, the Minister and legal experts are discussing the definition of a bar, and whether it is something one leans on or something over which drink is sold for consumption. Where are we going when debate on drink reaches this point?I recently read to my children some of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on alcohol. The task force suggested that some 50% to 60% of 16 to 18 year olds were consuming large quantities of drink and believed that binge drinking was consuming over six pints. Young people are told that two to three pints is enough for anybody but drinking from six to 12 pints is the norm. The health implications for such drinkers and the cost implications for the Exchequer are serious. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, introduced the smoking ban to try to save lives and save health service costs. However, we will incur significant costs caused by liver failure and other diseases because of the quantity of drink being consumed. I do not know where it will end.I spoke to the Minister over the summer, as did other colleagues, in regard to the 9 p.m. limit for children on licensed premises. I am delighted the Minister followed up on his commitment to revisit this subject as soon as he could in the new term. He did so last week in accepting the amendment in the other House. The parents most affected by the 9 p.m. rule were those who had their children with them, whether on holidays or otherwise, and not parents from dysfunctional families who do not know where their children are. I am open as to whether 10 p.m. is the correct cut-off time and perhaps 11 p.m. might be considered. However, while we may revisit the issue again, it is certain that 9 p.m. was too early in the summer months, especially given the importance of tourism and given that one has the option of flying abroad, whether with Ryanair or Aer Lingus, where one could sit at a cafe bar all night. The time limit needed to be changed and I am delighted the Minister has done so. I commend the Bill to the House.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I welcome the Minister. I am glad he has introduced the Bill. Members have taken the opportunity to philosophise on the issue of alcohol. One aspect which distinguishes politics on this issue is that some of those in politics who have been most constructive are those who could not be accused of being puritans in regard to alcohol or anything else. Whatever about my views on the Minister's politics, he is not a puritan. He has many other traits about which I am not positive but he is probably closer to a bon viveur than a puritan.We must address the fact that there has been a spectacular increase in the per capita consumption of alcohol in this country in a terrifyingly short period of time. Some of this has to do with the changing habits of older people who used to be Pioneers but now drink a few glasses of wine with a meal. However, if one considers the distribution of alcohol consumption, I am certain the intensity in terms of consumption increases, the lower the age group. Some of the content of alcohol use surveys is typical youthful bravado. If one asked a 16 year old how many sexual partners he had, the number he suggested would probably be physically impossible. However, there is no doubt a frightening culture of mindless drinking has taken over among some sections of the young.It is worth considering whether this is the cause of a problem or the symptom of a deeper problem. I always regarded myself as on the liberal wing of parenting. Although all of my children are now over 18, I learned early that I had to be sceptical about certain matters, in particular that I had to be sure I knew where my children were as distinct from thinking I knew. If one begins this process when children are young, by the time they are 16, despite the occasional stand-up row, a culture has been inculcated, though perhaps grudgingly and reluctantly. Then follows that awful period when children are aged 16 to 18. For example, when asked what time they are coming home, they reply 1.30 a.m. and one tells them that one will collect them. For a couple of years one hauls oneself out of the house at 1.30 a.m. pretending it is because they might not be able to get a taxi, pretending it is because one wants to be an indulgent parent letting them stay out, but knowing full well that the consequence of picking them up is that they know one will see the condition they are in, know where they have been and collect them from somewhere approximating to where they said they would be. There is no route around that. Giving them €20 and telling them to get a taxi home is probably an easier option and most of us in this House could easily have afforded that. However, it is not the way to steer people through.Neither can one write a law to make that happen. Parents' groups in particular get worked up about what the political system is or is not doing about under-age drinking. Perhaps they should take a look at themselves.We need to be wary because since alcohol was invented, 50 year olds have thought 40 year olds drink far too much, 40 year olds have thought 30 year olds drink far too much and so on. At the same time the objective evidence cannot be denied. In my student days and, I suspect, in the Minister's student days we drank as much as we could afford, but we could not afford much. One of the manifestations of youth culture that has changed is that most young people work during summer and sometimes during school or college time. Some of the money they earn is to support themselves but some of it goes to support a lifestyle that would have been unimaginable in the past. This is not a case of older, venerable people, or whatever people want to call us, bemoaning something. It is simply a fact of life that we must address. There is no way things will return to the way they used to be.Some of what is said about young people reflects a certain jealousy on the part of an older generation of the perceived hedonistic lifestyle that is now available to young people which was, perhaps, denied to them when they were young. We need to be very careful about that. I have the good fortune to teach young people. I work in a place that is populated by about 10,000 people aged between 17 and 23 years, consisting of 6,500 full-time students and a good number of part-timers. They work in a crowded environment with one overcrowded shop, one overcrowded canteen area and soon, I suspect, one overcrowded bar. They are fantastic people. There is no enforced security. Gardaí are rarely on the premises. They are not needed. I keep wondering how this impulse to mindless self destruction and mindless violence emerges because from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. it is not seen. However, it seems to emerge when the same young people, or perhaps different ones, go out somewhere else. However, approximately 50% of the age cohort between 18 and 24 is now in third level education, so the violence cannot all be elsewhere.There is a question of culture, attitude and values and of how one behaves under certain circumstances. My experience is that young people, as I see them in third level education, are fantastic. They are better behaved in their attitude to academic staff than I and my classmates were 30 years ago. There is a less rigid authority structure, but there is a much better sense of involvement and engagement between staff and students than there would have been 30 years ago. The degree of willingness to act up and make trouble for an academic staff member is far less than it would have been 30 years ago. We must take that into account instead of flagellating young people.The Minister is wrestling with this and has come up with some ideas with which my party does not agree. However, his ideas about café society and café bars are very good. When I was in Italy last year unfortunately in some cases I was in areas where there were many tourists. I noticed the bars stopped bar service at approximately 9 p.m. and resorted to table service only. If all our superpubs had to resort to table service at 10 p.m, instead of crowds of people waving €20 notes at the barmen behind the bar, a different culture would evolve. There could not be a huge rush because it would be constrained by the speed at which a reasonable level of service could be provided. The small café bars the Minister mentioned would be ideal places in which that type of culture could evolve.It is extraordinary, given that we do not have a tradition of drinking either coffee or anything else outdoors, that we are developing a new attitude to our weather, based on the smoking ban, which will produce the most remarkable displays of people drinking and, perhaps, having coffee out of doors on cold November nights simply because it is the only place they can smoke a cigarette. However, in Cork the Garda has demanded that items of street furniture be removed by 9 p.m. because they might be used as weapons in the case of disorder. The city council demurred and the time was changed to 11 p.m. That seems to be a chicken and egg argument because if people are sitting and there is table service it would probably reduce the incidence of disorder, but I will leave that to the Garda.I am glad the Minister introduced the Bill. I am still intrigued because all law is ambiguous. This week this Minister is in a very strong position to agree that all law is ambiguous. I do not want to pursue what I do not believe is a very serious issue, and which I would not want to make a political issue. However, all law is ambiguous because it is written down in language. The country's policing resources are always by definition over-stretched. The DPP's office is over-stretched. It takes a long time to get from a file being sent to the DPP to a decision to prosecute. In the middle of all these strained resources somebody somewhere decided this was an issue worthy of pursuit. There are issues on every bit of law from the possession of drugs to whatever one likes, where there is uncertainty or ambiguity and where what is written in what seems reasonable language is open to unreasonable interpretations. Perhaps when the archives are finally published somebody will explain — with a bit of luck I will be around to see it — why so much of the time of the Minister, the Department, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and senior members of the Garda Síochána——

In other places which I will not mention because it might get people into trouble, for instance, in rural areas, common sense approaches are taken to how the licensing laws are enforced. Reasonable positions are adopted by reasonable members of the Garda Síochána to be reasonable to the people in the communities in which they live and it works extremely well. Suddenly somebody somewhere decided to pursue this. It is still a matter of some contention to me.I am not particularly taken with the decision to move the 9 p.m. watershed to 10 p.m. for four months of the year. It is one step back towards a time when we had different laws for different times of the year. I cannot see why the new time could not apply to the whole year. This is an issue that needs to be revisited regularly. I do not disagree with what the Minister wants to do or with his unhappiness with the culture that has developed. However, I am not sure that having different thresholds for different times of the year is a good idea. I will be suggesting that it be amended. A good friend of mine, who runs a successful bed and breakfast and restaurant, recently received a Bord Fáilte representative. A question arose over licensing when the Bord Fáilte official claimed that what my friend described as a "counter" was in fact a "bar". The Bord Fáilte official then asserted that it was a bar if he said so. This is not a basis for good law. If definitions are needed, they should not leave power in the hands of middle-ranking individuals who like to flex their muscles.

I congratulate him on this Bill which expeditiously clears up the grey area that emerged when he was put in an awkward position between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. When I spoke on Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, I appealed to the Minister to extend the 9 p.m. watershed to 10 p.m. It is impossible for the large number of licensed premises that serve food to ask families with children having a meal to leave at 9 p.m. I hope, like Senator Ryan, it can be extended to a year round basis, as families go for meals in the winter too. I hope the licensing and codification Bill will provide for this extension in winter time as 10 p.m. is not really late. I disagree with Senator O'Toole's claim that it is not possible to get hot drinks, such as a cappuccino or hot port, in some licensed premises. A licensed premises where one cannot get a hot drink is now an exception, as 95% supply them. Recently, I got coffee and sandwiches in a small pub in Drogheda at 5 o'clock in the evening.All Members are concerned about under age and binge drinking. However, another problem lies in home drinking. A culture has emerged where young people now consume alcohol before going out to the pub or disco. Instead of paying €4 for a drink in a pub, young people can go to supermarkets and off-licences. Supermarkets, particularly foreign ones that have opened recently, sell foreign-brewed beer at €1 per can in a loss leader strategy. As €30 can purchase much alcohol, it encourages young people to load up the boot of a car. Then, after the party at home, they head out, well steamed up, to a pub or disco at 10 p.m. Unfortunately, many of these supermarkets employ foreign nationals. They are perfectly entitled to these jobs and I am glad about that. However, it is hard for people from China or Africa to determine whether a customer is 18 or 16 years of age. They do not really care anyway as they are part-time workers and will just serve the alcohol. A solution to this could be found in the codification Bill. We will be making representations to the Minister before that Bill is introduced to the House. I congratulate the Minister on clearing up this grey area.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I welcome the Minister to the House and this amending Bill which is a positive step. Since the Minister, Deputy McDowell, took office, he has stated his intention to address the chronic alcohol abuse and under-age drinking endemic in society. Extending the cut-off time from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. from May to October is another positive step. Even though a more detailed Bill on the licensing laws will be introduced, the 10 p.m. rule should be kept under review with the industry and the Garda. As Senator Ryan has stated, it would be positive if this were a year round provision. The Minister has displayed unprecedented willingness to be open-minded and prepared to change if it is necessary.Until recently, numerous Administrations failed to address the worsening alcohol problem. From time to time we have persisted in addressing the symptoms of the problem rather than the problem itself. This has been by way of various approaches from closing pubs earlier to extending the number of licences. However, we must get to the root cause of the problem which is one of culture and attitude. In addressing the cultural attitude to alcohol, changes will have to be made. The Minister referred to providing additional licences for café culture establishments. However, I do not see great merit in this encouragement as 16,000 licences are already available with more than enough access to alcohol. While it is great that one can buy a beer in McDonalds in Italy and Spain, Irish alcohol culture is not ready for such a direction. In the context of alcohol abuse, we could cut out under age drinking if there was a statutory identification card because there would not be the opportunity for these fake identification cards. It would, effectively, remove from the publican an obligation to make a judgment call. In the United States, there are random identification checks, whether people are in the 60s or 20s. That would be a great advantage. I believe the Minister would be interested in such a measure and I hope we could implement it in the future. As I said, there are many other positive aspects to such a measure, for example, one's PPS number could be on the card.In terms of addressing the drink culture, education in terms of showing young people the benefits and the woes of alcohol and that it can be enjoyed in moderation is the way to go. In regard to creating alternatives, perhaps we could involve the GAA and ask it to hold non-alcohol events for people. Pricing is also an issue, particularly when one considers that it is almost as expensive to drink coca cola or other soft drinks. We have a role to play in that regard. A variety of activities should be arranged for young people in the evenings so the focus would not be on going out and getting drunk. They could go out and celebrate whatever event or just have a Saturday evening out. Parents have a huge role to play in terms of incentivising their children and leading them away from alcohol. I welcome the Bill and ask the Minister to be cognisant of the points I made.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I welcome the Minister. I am delighted he accepted a common sense amendment tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe last week. The 10 p.m. time restriction should not be set in stone for all time. Time will prove there is much off season tourism in remote places. The west and Donegal already have off-season tourism when people bring families on holiday. We need to keep an open mind on the legislation which prohibits under 18 year olds from being in pubs after 9 p.m. in the winter.Before any debate on alcohol, we must acknowledge that Irish people like to drink. It is part of what we are and we must be open, up front and frank about it. This afternoon Denis Bradley, who chairs the North West Alcohol Forum, will be in the House and will meet the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to address alcohol problems in the north west. It is important the Minister stays in close touch with that group which has many good ideas. It is not my opinion that Irish people like to drink; it was said by Denis Bradley. He was the first person to say that before we do anything, we should start from the premise that Irish people like to drink.It is accepted that unless a young person can show valid identification, he or she should not have access to alcohol. However, the next challenge is what happens to 15, 16 or 17 year olds. As far as I am concerned, a 15 or 16 year old is a young adult. I am not saying they should have access to, or be served, alcohol in a pub but they are young adults and the question is what do we do for them? The only places where young people can be with their peers — every young person wants to be in a group — is at a disco or in their own homes. Senator Bohan hit the nail on the head when he said young people are meeting before they go to the pub. They have no problem drinking on the street on a cold night as long as they are well wrapped up. That is a challenge we must face. How do we cater for that group?As I said, everybody wants to be part of a group just as Fianna Fáil wants to be part of that all-encompassing Sinn Féin-Fianna Fáil group even though the natural partners for Fianna Fáil at present are the Progressive Democrats. Young people want to be part of a group, to hang out or, to use their language, "to chill out" with their peers.

We must afford young adults the opportunity to be under supervision in a controlled environment but with young people, perhaps 18 to 21 year olds, working with them in a paid capacity.Pubs are seriously feeling the pinch. The Minister does not need me to tell him that. Day time drinking is on the way out as is week night drinking. The trend is changing. People will ask whether it is the smoking ban or the increase in the price of drink. It is a combination of a number of factors. Society is changing. I have sympathy for good publicans who operate good public houses and who would not serve people if they came in drunk at 11.30 p.m. There are ambassadors in terms of good practice in public houses.I believe Senator Bohan hinted at the massive economic implication. A considerable amount of employment is provided by public houses. In Letterkenny, staff are being laid off. I am not demeriting the smoking ban but maybe we should consider facilitating people in a room separate from the main public house.We received literature in our post today from Restaurant Express. It is tapping into the change in society in terms of people staying at home. Perhaps it is because the price of drink in pubs is becoming expensive. The literature refers to dining out at home. I am giving good publicity to Heineken if "Oireachtas Report" decides to broadcast this debate but the literature states that one can get 20% off one's bill if one orders six or more bottles of Heineken with one's Restaurant Express food after 8 p.m. This is a reality check. There is a complete change in social behaviour. The implications of this are very dangerous. If couples are meeting in each other's houses, what happens young people when they are not being supervised? This is uncontrolled drinking until perhaps 6 a.m.Despite serving restrictions, the smoking ban and trying to introduce a nanny state, Irish people like to drink. We are not talking about prohibition as in the United States in 1929. People will drink elsewhere in uncontrolled environments. It will damage the pub trade which proved a controlled environment in which people could drink. That is the danger.

Many people with young children go into pubs which serve food at 8 p.m. but they are often told they cannot be served food because they might be there beyond 9 p.m. If one's order is only taken at 8 p.m, one may not be served on time.I wrote to the Minister in connection with the very successful Comhaltas Ceoltóirí activity of which Senator Ó Murchú would be aware. In the summer, many pubs in the area got people involved in Comhaltas to provide events that would appeal particularly to tourists. These were mainly young people, most of whom would be drinking soft drinks. In many cases they were under 16 years of age. A side effect of the ban, which one would perhaps not have anticipated, was to prevent those people from participating in Comhaltas activities in pubs over the summer. As tourists like to hear traditional music, I wrote to the Minister in the hope that an exception could be made, but the response was that no exception could be made as it is a general regulation and one has to accept it.It is said there is much pressure nowadays on people to drink. Publicans are complaining of a decline in the sale of alcohol. We all recognise that society has changed and more people drink at home. Many people are also drinking wine, sales of which have increased dramatically.I was in a well-known Dublin hotel which hosted one of the teams after the all-Ireland final. The place was absolutely mobbed. When I ordered a pint of Guinness at 11.15 p.m, it cost €4.15. However, at 11.30 p.m. when I went up for another few pints, I discovered the price had increased to €4.70. I queried the matter as I had not previously encountered such a practice, at least not in County Limerick. I was surprised to be informed that prices go up at 11.30 p.m. each night. The place was jammed. It was probably the biggest bonanza this hotel would have during the entire year. The people there were predominantly from rural locations. Many people must have been aware of what was going on. We must consider if the industry is going for overkill in regard to prices.There is no incentive for young people to consume soft drinks in a public house. In most public houses, the combination of a bottle of orange and lemon would cost way in excess of a pint of Heineken or Guinness. When I was growing up people often decided to join the Pioneers and one respected their decision. I wonder how many young people join the Pioneers nowadays, given the tremendous peer pressure they are under. Publicans could do something to incentivise the drinking of soft drinks in public houses. Most of them would admit the profit margins on soft drinks are extremely high.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I quoted Shakespeare to them. He said misery makes for strange bedfellows. I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for clarifying a few issues that have caused much confusion. I wish to make the case for the No Name Club organisation which needs more support than merely saying it is doing great work. By "support" I mean assistance with the organisation of discos and other functions, whether it is in a community hall or a licensed premises. In County Mayo the group is known as Dóthain. Dr. Michael Loftus has championed this particular cause for years. County Roscommon has another name for the organisation.Transport to events is also a major problem. As the Minister stated, licensed premises are more popular venues as they have good lighting, comfortable surroundings, disco music, special effects and so on. The Garda will confirm that many problems are associated with buses taking circuitous routes to these centres. Drink is often taken on board both on the way to events and on the way home. The current trend is for young people to travel further from home to discos and such events. I urge the Minister to address this issue.I welcome the extension of the 9 p.m. exemption to 10 p.m. but I would like to see it in operation all year round. The Minister referred to the tourism season. However, in County Galway, the three-day racing festival in July and early August has been extended to a week. Two oyster festivals follow that and another racing festival takes place on the October bank holiday weekend. It is very difficult to say when the tourism season starts and finishes in County Galway.Previous speakers referred to social events in licensed premises, such as weddings, retirement parties and birthday parties, particularly 21st birthday parties, which are important occasions. One does not expect everyone at a 21st birthday party to be over 18 because younger members of families also attend such events.What takes place after discos is a great cause for concern. As a father of teenagers, I am very worried about this issue. If we had enough taxis they could be relied on to bring people home safely, but that is not the case. I smile when I hear of people in Galway saying their young people come home in a taxi and if they do not have enough money, the parents will leave money on the table in the hall for them so they can pay when they get home. That is not an option when there are not enough taxis.The Minister referred to Galway in connection with the Director of Public Prosecution's direction that prosecutions be taken in certain cases where alcohol-free events were being held in licensed premises. Even though the District Court dismissed the charges on hearing that alcohol was not available and the bar shutters were closed, it still caused a great deal of concern as some confusion remained.At No Name Club functions I observed that soft drinks were available close to the door where one paid one's admission. In fact, the drink was almost given away for free, which was not a very good situation either. It is important for bar owners to know what are their rights and obligations. Difficult situations can arise for bar owners who have two bars or more in a premises which have to be organised and supervised. Another difficulty relates to people getting passes for a premises due to the risk of them availing of drink elsewhere.Accusations have been levelled at the Minister and others regarding the nanny state syndrome. That is all right as regards cutting turf but not accident and emergency departments. We have all seen programmes about this and I listened to discussions about it when I was a member of a health board. The suggestion was often made in that forum, as elsewhere, that people in a drunken state in need of accident and emergency services should be charged.One of the best things we ever did in the Western Health Board was to organise a one-day conference on alcoholism. A board member, Dr. Greg Kelly, spoke very movingly about his situation as a GP in the town of Castlerea where a disco was held every weekend. He was often up all night treating people involved in accidents or rows. The Garda was aware of what was going on. At one stage he was told he should get a psychiatrist's or psychologist's report at 3 a.m. His response was to query where he would get such people at that time of night.

That is the reality of what is happening. We have to examine the overall situation. I am very much in favour of the family pub in particular. I could not understand why discos got an extension of one hour to closing times when pubs got an extra hour. I am sure the Minister will address the matter in the codification of the law which he intends introducing. Unfortunately, in a way, the pub still has to be used for music and dancing lessons. The Minister has laid down the manner in which it should be used. Parents have an important role, as other Members have said. I hope that when the Minister introduces the law on codification, some of these other issues will be clarified.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on listening to the concerns of people. I come from a rural area where the only place open to organisations such as the GAA, soccer clubs or whatever to run a function or disco is the local bar. There is no hall available and I am glad that this situation is being sorted out. It presented a problem in certain areas and people were somewhat reluctant and afraid to organise particular functions.I agree with Senator McHugh. Members received leaflets this morning highlighting the concerns of the restaurant business about drink being ordered with meals. I am sure it is more relevant to Dublin than rural Ireland. However, drink will be delivered as long as the person collecting it has the money to pay for it. There is no control as regards who may be receiving this drink. I believe it is a retrograde step and there should be more controls in this regard.Some small publicans, who are decent people, are finding the business climate particularly tough at present. Many people agree with the smoking ban. I do not know a smoker who does not want to give up cigarettes, but the ban is certainly having an effect in rural areas, particularly in smaller pubs which have no yard space at the rear so that smokers have to go out onto the street to smoke. We should try to resolve that situation by providing some degree of flexibility in this regard. I say this in all sincerity because otherwise some publicans face closure. People will not go onto the street to smoke and to be seen standing outside a pub. It is having a serious effect on some businesses.While we complain about publicans and the price of drink, it is possible to buy a pint for €3 in my home town, Ballymote. The publicans there are making a genuine effort to keep prices regulated and to try to hold on to the business. Despite that, a friend of mine who runs a popular award-winning pub tells me his Guinness sales are down 9% on last year and spirits sales are down 18%. This is a well-managed pub which has won awards at county and provincial levels. When such a pub is losing business, God help the rest of them.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I wish to share my time with Senator Quinn, two minutes for me and the rest for him.I welcome the Minister to the House. Some Senators said this Bill would not be before the House today if common sense had been applied to the main piece of legislation. However, since the clarification was sought by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is a constituent of mine, I do not believe I will get involved in that debate. Votes are hard got sometimes.The purpose of the Bill is to clarify the situation and we have to reinforce the efforts being made to run alcohol-free discos. This is of major importance. I come at it in particular from the viewpoint of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency's report and the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda. Both have said that in teenagers, excess alcohol is an extremely important factor as regards sexual assault and unplanned pregnancies. I welcome anything that is being done to assist people in organising these types of events.Like other Senators I am somewhat concerned about the increase in the hours during which children are allowed into pubs. I hope it is not the thin end of the wedge. When the original legislation was going through the House, I was not the only Member who said that pubs were unsuitable places for small children late at night. I would hate to see that happening again. I see the Leader nodding and I would add that it is distressing to see little children crying frequently in pubs late at night. It cannot be great for those who want to drink in peace either.Other Senators made the point about the cost of soft drinks. This is extremely important and I hope the Minister will urge the Director of Consumer Affairs to keep a close eye on it. Perhaps the Minister would indicate also at the end of the debate whether tap water has to be available at these venues. The reason I ask is that about ten or 12 years ago a problem arose when some nightclub and disco venues turned off the tap water, even in the hand basins of lavatories. This pushed up sales of drink and it was truly dreadful. The environmental health officers were in dispute with the Department of Health at the time, so this carry-on continued for about six months. I would like to know if tap water has to be available in these venues free of charge or not.If possible, people should be encouraged to sell bottled water at a cheaper price than sweet sugary drinks which contribute to the problems of obesity. These are matters which the Director of Consumer Affairs must take up. I would like the Minister to liaise with her office about this matter.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I welcome the Minister and the Bill. I have notes prepared but I will not stick to them. I fear we try to solve everything through legislation. There are many matters we should not attempt to resolve through legislation. I am not sure where to start, but let us take the example of prohibition in the United States. It was introduced there in 1919, clearly did not have the support of the population and was repealed in 1931 after much greater problems had been created than heretofore. I agree entirely with what has been said concerning small children in pubs late at night. However, perhaps we should not attempt to solve everything by legislation.I will take one instance, for which I am partially responsible, when it was suggested in the House last year that something should be done about the dangers of salt in food, perhaps by taxing it. Since then I have thought it over and concluded that this would be the wrong approach. It is interesting to see what the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is now doing to try to convince, encourage and educate people in this regard and get them to think about it and even to shame them into not doing other things. One does not see many fur coats on the streets nowadays because people are somewhat shy and afraid of wearing them. This has nothing to do with legislation but with social pressure. Similarly, practices have changed in supermarkets, where plastic bags are not used to nearly the same extent. Whatever about the 15 cent tax, it is accepted that one is not acting in the best interests of society by using a plastic bag.On the question of legislation, my wife and I were in Salt Lake City in Utah a short time ago where we joined friends for dinner and were asked what we wanted to drink. My wife said red wine and I said white and this presented an immediate problem. The legislation in Utah stipulates that there cannot be two bottles of wine on a table in a restaurant at the same time. I switched to red wine, as we all did, and we had the white afterwards. This, perhaps, is an example of trying to legislate for everything.I know we talked in the House today about the nanny state. It is less a question of the nanny state that the danger of a police state which says, in effect, "We are going to legislate for everything." This is, perhaps, an example of where we have got to change attitudes and where people's behaviour patterns must alter. We must change the way they think. To draw on words used earlier, we must enthuse, encourage, educate and shame, so that people do not behave in a particular way. We opt too readily to try to resolve everything by legislation. In this case we thought we were doing the right thing. It was interesting to hear the Minister explain the difficulty he faced. The Minister, his adviser and the Attorney General were of one view on this aspect but the Director of Public Prosecutions had another. I am delighted the DPP is not a constituent of mine. Obviously, he is a Trinity College graduate and, therefore, I do not have to worry. I am not a lawyer and I hesitate to adjudicate between such legal luminaries as the Minister and the DPP.If I had to choose, and I read the DPP's guidelines, I would side with the DPP on the point of law but who is legally right or wrong in this case is irrelevant because either way the prosecutions should not have taken place. While I give the DPP ten out of ten for law, I give him zero out of ten for common sense, a term that has been used already. We are back here debating the Bill because some common sense has to be introduced.The DPP's guidelines state that the interest in seeing the wrongdoer convicted and punished is itself a public interest consideration. They go on to state that the more serious the offence and the stronger the evidence to support it, the less likely that some other factor will outweigh that interest. They state further that the first factor to consider in assessing where the public interest lies is the seriousness of the alleged offence and whether there are aggravating or mitigating factors.It would appear those guidelines were not followed on this occasion. We are not dealing with a serious offence for which it is important the wrongdoer is punished. We are dealing with nothing more than a technical offence brought about by sloppy drafting on our part because "bar" was used in the legislation when perhaps it should not have been.I mention this as a word of caution to us, as legislators. Let us not try to solve every problem by way of legislation. Speaking from a business point of view we market, advertise, promote and try to change attitudes. We do not have the right to instruct people what to do and we, as legislators, should consider that. I have no problem supporting the Minister in regard to this legislation. I regret it had to come back to this House because we slipped up when it was before the House previously.

While I recognise this is technical amending legislation, I do not intend to get into the debate on the issue of under-age alcohol abuse which the Members of this House have discussed here at length. In that regard the Minister was helpful in giving us a good deal of his time in the last session. Senator MacSharry and others dealt adequately with the change of culture, an issue on which Senator Norris also expressed views.Alcohol is readily available both inside and outside public houses, either through off-licences or other circumstances which my colleague opposite mentioned in regard to it being delivered to one's house with a meal. That is a worrying development and something I am sure the Minister will monitor.We must consider dealing with this problem through the education system because we do not want to return to the days of prohibition. Once we start regulating the sale of alcohol we will find that people have the capacity to drink either before they go to the pub or through other mechanisms. At least in the regulated environment of the pub there is some level of a safeguard because the majority of public houses I am aware of are run exceptionally well with a good management structure in place.I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken into account the difficulties surrounding the No Name Clubs and the alcohol-free discos. I am not concerned about the view of the DPP, unless he becomes a county councillor, although he is not in my constituency.I welcome the extension of the time limit. I come from a rural constituency, County Clare, where tourism is the mainstay of some of the villages, particularly along Lough Derg. The Minister mentioned the River Shannon and beaches in the past few days, and County Clare fits neatly into that category. We have seen the issues that pertain to the good management of a tourism business in the county.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I am sure Roscommon is a good tourism area also.I welcome the extension of the time to 10 p.m. from 1 May to 30 September. Like other Senators, I believe it should be extended to a year round basis. I hope the Minister will review that going forward. The Minister said the extension will facilitate parents, particularly around the holiday season, but it will also help to address some of the negativity within the tourism sector, particularly on the part of foreign tour operators. I am aware an effort is being made by some tour operators outside Ireland to label Ireland as unfriendly to tourists because of the smoking ban and the early closing time. That is important from the point of view of national as well as foreign tourism. It is also important to help maintain the fabric and infrastructure of our tourism sector, and pubs and restaurants do that. As Senator Bohan and others said, there is a real threat to the livelihoods of some of those businesses. From talking to business people over the summer it appears that while tourist numbers nationally are up, the spend is down dramatically. We have to monitor that problem because the livelihoods of some of those people are in jeopardy.While the smoking ban has had a positive effect, it has also affected the businesses concerned. In some respects it is now more acceptable to bring young children into pubs for a meal because many of the publicans have altered their business model and are now investing in quality kitchens and a good food facility as part of their businesses. These areas are becoming more attractive, therefore, to the sector of people who like to eat out in that they facilitate people with young families. It will be interesting to see how the Minister deals with that aspect when he brings forward the codification Bill because there are many licences available, particularly in light of the change in model with which many businesses are dealing, and the demand for the standard pub is no longer as relevant as it was previously. This is a challenge to the tourism sector, an area we must examine, because while tourist numbers are up the spend is down. That is causing hardship and has the capacity to have a long-term effect on the overall sector if the level of infrastructure is not maintained, something about which I would be concerned.In light of this I ask the Minister to consider extending the 10 p.m. limit to a year round basis to ensure the issues I have raised do not result in a weakening of the infrastructure. Effectively, we have a year round tourism industry. Easter, St. Patrick's weekend, Hallowe'en and Christmas are family holidays. People like to spend them in the rural areas from which they come, as do those returning from overseas. Social life begins a little later in rural areas. People do not go to the pub at 6 p.m. as they may do in the cities on their way home from work. At 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m. there are very few people in pubs in rural Ireland but by 11 p.m. there is a crowd. Perhaps that is part of what the Minister is trying to do in terms of the change of culture but it is a slow process.In regard to foreign tourism, the school terms abroad are different and we must ensure we cater for that in whatever way possible. I thank the Minister for the work he has been doing in this area.

The Bill closes a loophole which I did not believe existed but one never knows the way people's opinions vary. The Bill was deemed to be necessary. Everybody approves of the No Name Clubs and discos for young people which allow enjoyment without intoxicating liquor. The Minister and his Department deemed the Bill to be necessary, although I read during the summer that he said it was not but other persons and agencies disagreed and it had to be introduced. We welcome that aspect of the Bill.The Minister accepted the amendment to allow for a change in the time when children may be on the premises, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., having previously accepted one in this House for a change from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. I have not moved from my position, which some Members shared, that I never agreed with young children being in pubs. When I go out for a drink I do not want very young children dancing around my feet and knocking over bottles and shrieking. I love children and am a most adoring parent and grandparent but I know their limitations in hot, crowded circumstances. We are portrayed as if we want to embrace our families and bring them with us as appendages wherever we go. That was thought to be our lovely trait, hence we wanted to bring children to the pubs. There is a great difference between bringing babies and very young children into pubs and those of more adult years who can contain themselves and behave appropriately.Many pub owners said that this provision was a difficulty for them. They might, however, think of their customers who do not share that point of view. I was of the view contained in the earlier Bill and have not changed simply because the Minister has agreed to change the time. If it eases a burden on pub owners, that is a good thing. It is for the summer months only because the main tenor of the argument appeared to be based on tourists who wanted to embrace their families for 24 hours of the day — they will get sense. The idea is presumably motivated by many representations made to the office of the Minister and the Department and through the political parties.We welcome the Bill. I particularly welcome the codification Bill the Minister is bringing to Cabinet soon. It would be a very good idea to bring it to this House first where we will give it a thorough airing; I say this so that the Minister will know what colour paper to print it on. We will be very glad to deal with it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	145	In response to the Leader's last point I intend to introduce the codification Bill in Seanad Éireann as soon as it is drafted, which is important. There were and are different views about the 9 o'clock threshold. In case people get carried away with how right they were in the past, which we all have a tendency to do, when I moved the time from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock, some Senators, including Senator Bohan, welcomed it and said it was not far enough but Senator Terry on behalf of the Fine Gael group said:This is proof that one cannot please everybody. I would have preferred the time to be left at 8 p.m. However, perhaps this is a difference between Dublin and the country. When one goes into a pub on a Sunday evening, one will regularly see children running around. They should not be there after 8 p.m. However, I do not have a difficulty with the provision because the single hour does not make a great deal of difference. Pubs that serve food could install a separate dining area which would only be used for dining and by families with young children.All of this was true. The threshold was not motivated by a desire on my part to prevent children being in, for example, a local pub such as The Dropping Well in my constituency, after any particular hour of the night. It was designed to make some starting point after which a member of the Garda Síochána could go into The Dropping Well and identify 16 or 17 year olds drinking and say the publican was committing an offence. It is not intended to stop toddlers annoying people and knocking down their drinks while chasing one another around. It also marks an hour when somebody between the ages of 18 and 21 would be obliged to produce evidence of their age. I am not attempting to create a nanny state to control toddlers who are annoying their elders but to establish some point in the day when the gardaí can tell a publican he or she has 16 or 17 year olds on the premises and is breaching the law.It is easier to talk about the need to control the so-called alarming development of distance sales than actually to control them. If, for example, Senator Quinn's supermarket has a delivery service and I order a case of Beaujolais, that is a distance sale. Will it be illegal if the case of Beaujolais arrives at the house and there is a child there? We must be very careful about where we go with these concepts. It is easier to talk about them than to legislate for them.I agree with Senator Quinn that we cannot deal with all issues by legislation. There are very strict limits on what legislation can achieve. I was very conscious in the 2003 Act that I was going as far as I could at the time to address what was then regarded as a very serious problem. It is amazing how people's attitudes change. There were "Prime Time" programmes showing young children having their stomachs pumped in hospital. People asked me what I was going to do and I could have archly said: "It is a matter for people to control their own behaviour, do not ask me." I could also have said that street violence is a matter of personal choice and people should not ask me what I am going to do about it. I could have said drunkenness in the streets is a matter of personal choice.

Had I said that I would have been screamed out of public existence for taking a blasé attitude to serious situations. There is a balance to be achieved in this. In saying that evidence of age was required for young drinkers we went as far as we could down the road to control under-age drinking. In the Dáil, for instance, the then Fine Gael spokesman on justice said he would not support my Bill at all unless I outlawed all 21 year olds from all drinking establishments everywhere in Ireland. It is very simple for people to erase from their memories——

People have a great capacity to claim they were right all along but what they were saying all along was quite different.I welcome the general support for the Bill. The question of whether the 10 p.m. rule should apply for all or part of the year can be considered again in the context of the overall consolidating legislation. The points made to me were that families were out together in the summer and wanted to go in and have something to eat afterwards and bring the kids in with them. If one is now saying that Ranelagh, Finglas or Temple Bar are tourist locations where 16 and 17 year olds should be allowed into pubs unaccompanied by adults up to 10 p.m., I have a problem with that. That explains why we have gone as far as we have on the summer months rule.

I have received no communication to that effect. It may be because we moved straight on to Committee Stage.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I am glad to hear the two Houses of the Oireachtas are at least consistent because it appears that different arms of the State cannot be consistent in their interpretations of legislation. Otherwise we would not be discussing this Bill.The nub of my amendment No. 4 relates to the issue of the bar counter. Whether this amendment is relevant depends on how one interprets section 1(5), which states:It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under section 33, 34 or 34A of the Act of 1988 to prove that at the time of the alleged offence intoxicating liquor was not being sold, supplied or consumed on the licensed premises concerned or, as the case may be, the part concerned of those premises and that any bar counter thereon was securely closed.This section refers to a "bar counter" which is otherwise missing from the Bill. While I am not being critical, in the Dáil the Minister was somewhat ambiguous as to whether this subsection was a defence to be used for past offences or a possible defence in case somebody is prosecuted in a way we cannot currently envisage. After all none of us envisaged that this legislation would be necessary.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	158	In this Bill, it was my intention to afford a defence to a person who had in the past run an event, for example, a disco or an Irish dancing class, in premises containing a bar with closed shutters. In the Dáil, Deputies English and Costello claimed I was taking a very narrow view of the idea of closing a bar. They said that if I really wanted to encourage bar and club owners in future to hold large events such as discos for youngsters, by forbidding them from selling minerals over the bar or using the glasses, basins and cash registers from behind the bar, I would seriously inconvenience people who had no intention of exposing the youngsters in such places to alcohol.Obviously two views on this matter exist. I was persuaded by their view that in future I should not act to inhibit somebody making use of the bar counter, basins, water supply, ice making machine, glasses and cash register in the context of an alcohol-free disco where the children would line up at the bar counter for something to drink. Sections 1(1) to 1(4) make it clear that no offence will be committed in future as long as the owner completely removes alcohol from that part of the premises and securely locks it away. However, I did not want to say that it would be a defence to show that the alcohol was locked away regarding offences that could have been committed before this Act was commenced because the police would not have been in a position going into such premises on the state of the law as it then was to grope around the counters to verify whether all the alcohol had been put away, etc.A distinction is made between sections 1(1) to 1(4) and the defence offered in section 1(5) in that section 1(5) is supposed to include both past and future situations, whereas sections 1(1) to 1(4) are to be declaratory of what the law is from the passing of the Bill onwards with a view to encouraging people to provide the facilities to which Deputies English and Costello referred. Therefore, I am making that conscious distinction. It is true that the language of sections 1(1) to 1(4) is wider than the defence in section 1(5) and that is a matter of deliberate choice on my part in framing the Bill. I had said in public that if the bar were shuttered, a defence existed. I wanted to save people from further prosecution in those cases in respect of relying on what I had said was the advice available to me and from the Attorney General.This proposal is now wider in sections 1(1) to 1(4). Effectively it states that the circumstance in section 1(1) that physical access to intoxicating liquor is securely prevented is to be sufficient in future. From now on if an owner clears out the drink from behind the bar, opens the shutters and uses the bar facilities only for the purpose of serving minerals——
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Or water.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	160	——or water to children across the bar and can show there is no question of alcohol being in a position to be consumed on the premises — in other words that access to it is securely prevented — an offence is not committed. A distinction is drawn between section 1(5) and what is referred to in the preceding four subsections. This is based on the very simple proposition that the Attorney General and I had come to the view, as I have stated in public, that people did not commit an offence when the shutters were closed and I am intent on saving those people. In the future I am willing to concede Deputy English's broader and slightly more liberal approach.Senator Henry asked about serving water. It is not a legal requirement on any night-club to have tap water available at all. However, I would imagine the Judiciary would take a very poor view of any night-club preventing access to running water. As Senators know, in the past it was seen as a partner in the consumption of ecstasy and the denial of access to it was regarded as having a serious health implication. Quite apart from that matter, there is the economic issue. I do not expect publicans to supply tap water over the counter for nothing. Decent publicans to their credit frequently do. We cannot say that as a matter of right anybody is entitled to enter licensed premises and ask for tap water for nothing.

During campaigning in the Dublin West by-election, won by Deputy Brian Lenihan, she was outside a supermarket. A lady wearing one of Senator Quinn's fur coats approached her pushing a trolley and berated her over the possibility of the introduction of water charges. It may have been implied that such charges were not completely off the agenda at the time. She gave out socks to the Tánaiste at the very thought of it. The Tánaiste looked into the trolley and found it full of bottled water for which the lady had paid a vast sum of money. It makes one wonder about these matters.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I thank the Minister for his reply. Whenever I have asked for a glass of water in a pub, I have received it with ice and often a slice of lemon at no charge at all. Under health legislation, the Minister is right that they were quite wrong at that time to turn off the water at hand basins in the lavatories.

I am not keen on a return to the distinction between the licensing laws in the winter and the summer. I suspect that some parts of the Minister's brain must have been severely stretched by the consolidation of all the legislation. It is an interesting commentary on our culture that while we see the pub and the consumption of alcohol as part of our social life, we have also generated an extraordinary raft of legislation in that regard. It is as if our collective national brain has two sides, one entirely devoted to the enjoyment of alcohol and the other devoted to pretending that we do not really enjoy alcohol. The result is that we have created a raft of legislation. I understand that the Minister will not accept the amendment I have moved. I have plenty of things to fall out with the Minister about, so I will not fall out with him about this matter.

We spoke earlier about wine. When a barrister friend of mine who went into a pub in Valentia or Portmagee was asked by the landlady what he wanted, he asked for a glass of wine. There was a perplexed look on the landlady's face as she asked if he wanted sherry wine or port wine.

In page 4, subsection (8), line 16, to delete "extended or amended" and substitute "amended, substituted or inserted, as the case may be,".I do not often say this but I am moving this amendment because I have been advised that the phrase "amended, substituted or inserted, as the case may be" is more appropriate than the phrase "extended or amended". I offer this advice to the Minister in the spirit in which it was offered to me — as an attempt to be more precise. We should worry, as we consider this Bill, about the capacity of other people to demand precision from legislation that mere legislators cannot come up with, apparently.

Having listened to debates in the House over the years, I have formed the view that Senators are reasonably sensible about the matter most of the time. It would be worthwhile to get the views of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the 40,000 lobby groups outside the Oireachtas, before the legislation is introduced.

If this or the other House wants to examine it in advance, I will not oppose such a debate, depending on the House's time constraints. I do not want to make it too complicated, however. I do not want to provide for two bites of the cherry because that would mean I would be here for the rest of my life.

The amendments being made in the Bill represent a victory for common sense, as I said earlier. I compliment the Minister and his officials. The error or omission in section 14 of the 2003 Act has been rectified. I hope we can proceed positively from this juncture.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I congratulate the Minister too. As I said earlier, the Minister brings legislation to the House every time he comes here. Something will be gained every time we talk about the subject matter of the Bill before the House. Some people have said that we should have seen this problem coming, but the practical application of legislation is sometimes the best way to proceed, especially if amendments need to be amended. I agree with the Minister that we will have an opportunity to make further helpful amendments when the codification Bill is introduced. I congratulate the Minister again.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I agree with those Senators who said they would prefer not to be here today. I would prefer if a different view had been taken of this matter. The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent of me. I cannot and do not criticise him for taking his own view of the law. Where two views are open in respect of a statute, however, it is a matter of legal construction — a rule of the criminal justice legal system — that the construction which is more favourable to innocence must be accepted by a court. In this case, to direct prosecutions required the DPP not merely to come to the view that he was right, but also to think that nobody else was right. In other words, the view had to have been formed that two reasonable constructions were not possible. It is obvious that the Attorney General and I agree with the DPP in that regard, as do some members of the District Court Judiciary.There is nothing I can do because I respect the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I cannot telephone the DPP to say, "Ah, please", or "Maybe you are wrong, maybe you will reconsider". We do not have that relationship, for very good reasons. I have the height of respect for the DPP. He has taken the initiative of suggesting to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other agencies that there should be more joined-up thinking. However, it is his decision whether a prosecution is instituted and his alone. A different view taken by others is of no significance if he gives a clear direction to the gardaí to prosecute in certain cases. I can do nothing other than legislate in such circumstances.I thank the House and all the Members for their contributions to this debate. I regret that I have had to trespass on their time with this urgent matter. We should not forget that there is a motion for early signature. I ask Members to support it.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, subsection (2), lines 37 and 38, to delete "the recommendation of the Government." and substitute the following:"(a) the nomination of the Government, and(b) the passage of resolutions by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann recommending the appointment.”.I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his appointment. Just as the Minister was reshuffled, I have recently been honoured by being made the spokesperson for defence on this side of the House, along with other duties. I look forward to working with the Minister.In our nine amendments, we on this side of the House have proposed what we believe are beneficial additions to the legislation. The Minister knows the position of the Fine Gael Party regarding support for this Bill in both Houses. As the Minister is aware, the position of ombudsman is nominated by the Government before appointment by the President. On the appointment of Ms Emily O'Reilly to the position of Ombudsman, a resolution was put before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Fine Gael believes it would be wise to have the same process in regard to the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. We are not in any way countering the Government's view in regard to the nomination but think a positive resolution by both Houses following a debate would be good for the office and the office holder. It would be bad practice for Parliament if somebody was plucked from nowhere and appointed to this very senior office without parliamentary scrutiny. A recent report of this House recommended there should be some form of parliamentary scrutiny in regard to major Government appointments.The amendment aims to allow the nomination of the Government to occur in the normal way, as it would in regard to the Garda ombudsman proposed in the Garda Síochána Bill currently before the House and the Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly. A resolution would have to be passed in both Houses to allow the Government to state the name of the person. Whether a debate occurs, that is fine. However, this would be a way of bringing Parliament into the process of appointing this important office holder.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well on his appointment. On being appointed, the Minister was handed a Bill which had gone through all Stages in the Dáil. It is now before the Seanad. This poses a certain difficulty in that if the House approves any amendment, the Bill will have to go back to the Dáil, although that is not a great difficulty. However, from my contacts with the organisations involved, they have no objections in this regard.I can see the merit of the amendment. Approval by the Dáil and Seanad gives the position a certain status, which is more than a technicality. I am not sure if the Minister would wish the Bill to be delayed and my contacts with the representative bodies suggest they want it passed as quickly as possible. I do not want it delayed and am certain Senator Brian Hayes agrees. However, I reiterate that the proposal has merit and would give a certain independence to the role of ombudsman which may have been overlooked. That the appointment would be approved by both Houses would give the ombudsman extra status. Nonetheless, given the necessity for a speedy passage of the Bill and my commitment to the representative organisations, I will leave it to the Minister to decide the best course of action.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Yes, I have.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The argument the Senator makes regarding delay does not stand up. We are in the House to ensure that legislation is the best it possibly can be. It is up to Members to make that judgment and we have always taken that role seriously.We should consider each amendment on its merits, not in regard to the timeframe involved. In any case, this would not create an extraordinary delay. The Bill has been two years in gestation. While the House is happy to deal with it as expeditiously as possible and Members have always been committed to dealing with legislation as efficiently as possible, one must consider that the Bill has been in gestation for two years. Another few weeks would not make a significant difference.What would make a difference, however, is the enhancement of the status of the office. As Senator Leyden stated, the amendment would enhance this and would underline the independence of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The independence of the ombudsman is an extremely important element of the office. It cannot be effective unless it is independent and seen to be so and unless those using the office and those to whom it applies have complete confidence in it. The amendment would enhance that and I support it.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I thank Senator Brian Hayes for his good wishes. I accept that the amendment and all his proposed amendments are put forward with the best intentions to achieve the best legislation. I accept that Fine Gael was very supportive of the idea of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces and put forward suggestions in the Lower House which improved the Bill. I hope the Senator does not take it as a personal reflection on him if I reject the amendments.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The Bill provides that the Defence Forces ombudsman will be appointed to that office by the President acting on the recommendation of the Government. This mirrors the mode of appointment of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. The amendment would require the person appointed to the office of Defence Forces ombudsman to be appointed in a similar mode to other holders of statutory offices of ombudsman, for example, the original 1980 Ombudsman for the public service and the more recent Ombudsman for Children. However, these offices provide a very wide range of public functions and are available to the entire body of the general public, essentially the entire national population as regards their various functions. The Defence Forces ombudsman, however, has by definition a much more restricted potential audience and remit, namely, the serving personnel of the Defence Forces and former such personnel as subject to the provisions of the Bill. The remit of the Defence Forces ombudsman is restricted to matters internal to the Defence Forces subject to the provisions of the Bill as a whole.I take the point about the status of the office. The amendment was initially what was wanted by the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. However, the Department has been in communication with the association to explain our thinking. I would not mislead the House by stating that PDFORRA is now fully in line with the thinking of the Department. The idea is to have a mode of appointment for the ombudsman which would exactly mirror that for the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, which will give even greater status to the office. This is the current thinking and we are ad idem with PDFORRA on this matter. In addition, not to require a resolution of the Dáil and Seanad gives more flexibility as an appointment would not have to wait until the Houses are sitting, although that is a minor point.We have emphasised the importance of the office by providing that the office holder would be appointed in precisely the same way as the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. This has been discussed with PDFORRA which is now quite satisfied. With respect to all points of view, I would prefer to leave the Bill as it stands.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I appreciate the Minister's argument against the amendment. His suggestion is, in effect, that this appointment follows the same route as that of the Chief of Staff and we should accept it. However, the job description of the Defence Forces ombudsman is different, a point which goes to the heart of other proposed amendments which deal with the remit of the ombudsman. While I understand the Minister's point, it is bad practice in regard to any high level appointment, in particular when the seal of the President must be affixed before the nomination is granted, that neither of the Houses nor a committee of the Oireachtas would debate or sanction the nomination.I am not suggesting the Bill is the only example of such bad practice. This country must move to a system where there is genuine parliamentary scrutiny of decisions taken by Government. The Government has the right to make the decision but the Oireachtas has a right not to veto the decision, but to give sanction and support to it. The way to achieve this, which the office holder would appreciate, is through some form of resolution and a debate in both Houses. We might return to this on Report Stage.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, subsection (5), to delete from and including "such" in line 10, down to an including "exceed" in line 11.Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 relate to the appointment of the ombudsman. The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to ensure the ombudsman is appointed for a fixed term, not for a shorter term for political expediency or as a damage limitation exercise. In the case of legislation dealing with other ombudsmen, such as in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, in the proposed Garda Bill, or in the original Ombudsman Act 1980, to which the Minister referred in his earlier reply, it is quite clear that a specific term is provided for, usually seven years, and then a person can be re-appointed for a second seven-year term. Our intention in amendment No. 2 is that the term should be for seven years and the Government should not be entitled to truncate that to four or five years. That would be wrong and should be changed.Regarding amendment No. 3, we do not believe it would be beneficial to an appointee to be entitled to hold office beyond a second term. This is an important point. In the case of any high level appointment where Presidential approval is sought, it is important to state that the maximum in existing legislation is two seven-year terms. Section 2(5) of the Bill states, "and such person may be eligible for re-appointment to the office for a second or subsequent term." This deviates from the existing legislative base for all of the ombudsmen we have put in place. Fourteen years in such a position is enough for anyone. Even for the purpose of pension entitlement for high office holders, 14 years is the maximum for the President of Ireland and for the existing ombudsmen. We need consistency. It would not be good if somebody were to hold a job for 21 years but the legislation, as drafted, allows for that.Perhaps the Minister would clarify the Government's intentions. Is it intended that the term of an appointment will be seven years, as we believe it should be, and that the maximum duration of an appointment will be two terms amounting to 14 years? There should be consistency. That is the intention in tabling amendments Nos. 2 and 3.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Senator Hayes's amendment is extremely important. At the heart of it is a very fundamental point which relates to the previous amendment regarding the nomination and appointment of the ombudsman, namely, the power of the Government regarding appointments, how that would impact on the office and on how it is seen. This paragraph gives the Government and future Governments power to re-appoint one person again and again. While that person may be very good at the job, we have established the principle, for instance, with regard to departmental Secretaries General, that it is not a job for life. That was established in the strategic management initiative. It also applies to county managers and, I am sure, to other posts that do not come to mind at the moment.The principle is a very important one and should be reflected in the legislation. This section of the legislation gives this and future Governments carte blanche to re-appoint the same person over and over again, which is inconsistent with the thinking of the past number of years. In terms of how the position is viewed by those using it, it is important that it be seen to be as independent and as effective as possible. We need to be very careful as to the powers we give this and subsequent Governments regarding this role. In that regard, I ask the Minister to carefully consider Senator Hayes’s amendment and to accept it.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The legislation provides for a period not exceeding seven years with provision for a possible second and subsequent term of appointment. The amendments in the name of Senator Hayes would provide for a fixed term of appointment of seven years with the possibility of one second term of appointment only. The second term would presumably also be for a fixed term of seven years. That would amount to 14 years in total over two terms. The proposed amendments would allow an individual to serve for 14 consecutive years in total. Senator Hayes will say that in theory the legislation also allows for that. However, similar amendments were put down on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil. My predecessor examined this issue very carefully during the Dáil deliberations on the Bill. Having examined the issue again I cannot, unfortunately, accept Senator Hayes's amendment.The provisions of the Bill regarding term of appointment were drafted in order to provide flexibility in making an appointment. They were drafted not necessarily from the Government's viewpoint but from the viewpoint of potential appointees. A suitable potential appointee might be interested in filling the position for a period of three, four or five years but may not wish to undertake the task for a full seven-year term. We need to retain some degree of flexibility regarding the term of appointment. As a consequence we also require flexibility regarding the possibility of second and subsequent terms.In the context of the new Defence Forces ombudsman it is important that artificial restrictions are not introduced into this primary legislation which could in practice serve to frustrate the filling of the post by a suitable candidate for a term of less than seven years. The Bill provides that the question of the fixing of the duration of the term of appointment should be left to the instrument of appointment, subject to the term not exceeding seven years in the case of any one or subsequent appointment. I am convinced this is the best practical operational model for this new position.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The instrument is not in the legislation. It will follow the legislation. The Minister will have the power, under his seal of office, to introduce the instrument once the Bill is signed by the President. He has already confirmed regarding the term "not exceeding" that it is conceivable under the legislation, when it is in place, that the Government could appoint someone for a five-year period. That is not good. This is a new area of legislation which has been in place only since the early 1980s. Much of the knowledge we have built up illustrates that, if anything, investigations take a very long time. It is important for an ombudsman to know he or she has a seven-year term, although it would not be a problem if he or she wanted to resign after three years. There are absolute guarantees in the legislation regarding that and the Government can make a new appointment.However, there is no discretion given in the legislation regarding section 2(5). It is not specific enough and I would ask the Minister to re-examine this. I am playing devil's advocate in suggesting a scenario that could arise where an ombudsman comes across a practice within the Defence Forces that he or she is working hard to bring to our attention and resolve, and a vested interest contacts him or her and makes life very difficult, knowing that he or she is not guaranteed a seven-year period. I would be happier if the contents of the instrument to which the Minister has referred were put into the body of the Bill. If the Minister were on this side of the House, which is pretty rare these days, he would say the same. He would want to see the details in the Bill rather than in instruments that are introduced later. It is always a bellyaching point from those of us on the Opposition benches that most of the powers that exist regarding primary legislation follow in statutory instruments.I ask the Minister to re-examine this issue, to be brave and to do the right thing. He will not be trampling on his predecessor who now has more time to traipse around the beautiful countryside of Tipperary. If anything he will be building on his legacy and doing something very unique in the legislation before us.

However, one runs into difficulties when micro-managing these matters in primary legislation. A suitable person for the office of ombudsman may not want to serve for a shorter period than seven years. A statutory provision requiring an ombudsman to serve for seven years may discourage suitable candidates for the post. It is not much good if a person applies for the job but resigns after five years. Flexibility is important in this matter.The Opposition is suspicious of the Government——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	217	We are paid to be suspicious.

Flexibility is needed on this matter so the best people apply for the post. If Senator Brian Hayes's amendment, as worded, is accepted, an ombudsman appointed for seven years who was good would have to do a second term. Many a good person refused a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin because they could not face another seven years.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 7, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following new subsection:"(3) The Ombudsman may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so and without receiving a complaint, investigate any matter that appears to it to indicate that a member of the Defence Forces may have—(a) committed an offence, or(b) behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.”.The Bill as drafted means complaints can be taken from existing members of the Defence Forces, but with some caveats. However, it is important in the public interest that the ombudsman be given as much flexibility to investigate any matter he or she so wishes. The ombudsman will decide what is of public importance and what is not. Due to the cultures that exist in armies, people can feel confined in coming forward. There is an argument for allowing the ombudsman to take on matters of public importance of his or her volition. This is a matter of ensuring the ombudsman's independence and being given a free hand to investigate matters he or she feels are warranted. It is unwise to limit the ombudsman's investigative powers to the pursuit of complaints made to him or her.This provision mirrors the existing proposals for the Garda ombudsman in the Garda Síochána Bill. This amendment will introduce consistency in the posts. There may be cases where complaints will not be made to the ombudsman but where it is in the interests of the Defence Forces that these matters be investigated. The ombudsman will know what is and is not important. The full independence of the office will be greatly helped by this subsection.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I support this important amendment. When the Ombudsman for Children Act was debated in the House, there was much discussion on that ombudsman's role being proactive in investigating policy areas, such as the condition of schools and in the operation of his or hers functions. Giving an ombudsman an independent proactive role is important.The Bill states that the ombudsman can only operate on the basis of a complaint received. However, areas and practices in the Defence Forces may come to the ombudsman's attention which he or she believes to be the subject of investigation. Without a complaint he or she cannot do so. The ombudsman must have the power to independently initiate investigations, particularly on issues that come to public attention through the media, but have not been the subject of complaint from a member of the Defence Forces. This amendment provides for a valuable function in this regard and I ask the Minister to give it positive consideration.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I strongly support this amendment as it would strengthen the office and assist the ombudsman to do what is required. In the Lower House, the Minister spoke about patterns of behaviour and changes in culture that cried out for this. In my experience when I worked in an ombudsman's office without this power, it was desperate. I came up against issues that I knew needed to be investigated but unless someone made a complaint, they could not be touched. It was demeaning to the office for me to ask people to complain about matters.In personnel areas, it is difficult for people to make complaints about bullying and sexual harassment. When I wrote the script of the Northern Irish police ombudsman, I thought it important that the post be given a power of initiative. While such a power should not be used indiscriminately, some ombudsmen overuse it. It needs to be hedged about. Senator Brian Hayes's formulation, "it appears desirable in the public interest", hedges it enough. One may find ways of requiring the ombudsman to define "the public interest". Indeed, if somebody in Army management did not agree with the proposal, there should surely be means of bringing it to the court to decide what is the public interest. It should be on grounds of public interest only and not for prurient curiosity or for a fishing expedition. The ombudsman should be forced, if necessary, to justify his or her allegation that it was in the public interest. This would, inevitably, strengthen the office of the ombudsman. It would be a much weaker office if the Minister did not allow this. I hope he can agree to the amendment.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I have studied this amendment carefully and listened to what Senator Maurice Hayes has said. Given his experience, it would be unwise not to take on board his viewpoint. However, from a Defence Forces' perspective, the institution is somewhat different in that a body of personnel is subject to civil as well as military law and is governed under the Defence Act. The military police investigate matters of concern. In my time in the Defence Forces, I never saw occasions when the Defence Forces were afraid to investigate matters. Reading this amendment, I would be somewhat nervous that the office of the ombudsman could turn into a type of inspectorate. We could have situations where there could be civil and military police investigations and where the ombudsman could move in because he or she decided it was in the public interest.When looking at a body such as the Defence Forces, one must accept the uniqueness of the fact that they are governed by military law and there is a system in place. If the ombudsman was suspicious that a member of the Defence Forces had committed an offence or behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings, he or she could seek to commence an investigation. I would be concerned that we could over-investigate and, in a way, weaken the position of the ombudsman.I appreciate what Senator Maurice Hayes said and I can imagine an ombudsman sitting in his or her office waiting for a complaint to come on a matter of interest he or she felt should be investigated. However, I would be more than surprised if the Defence Forces had not initiated an investigation within its own system and network. As I said, if there is a civil investigation into a member of the Defence Forces, one can rest assured it would be automatically mirrored within the Defence Forces system. It would be triggered automatically. There have been occasions when a military investigation taking place in the Defence Forces has warranted a civil investigator being called in because it has overlapped into civil law. For that reason, I would be a little uncomfortable if we were to proceed down this road.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I take on board what has been said by Senators about the potential reluctance of people to come forward and make a complaint. We have engaged in a number of initiatives to deal with that into which I will go if Senators wish.In regard to this amendment, it is an essential principle of the legislation that, subject to the provisions of the Bill, the Defence Forces ombudsman may investigate an action that is the subject of a complaint made to him or her by a person affected by the action. It is an essential condition, therefore, that there must be an identifiable individual complainant in place. This proposed amendment would depart from that basic concept. One cannot envisage how, in practice, the Defence Forces ombudsman could autonomously commence an investigation into an action in the absence of either a complainant or a complaint.Moreover, this amendment would apparently place the ombudsman in the position, as Senator Minihan indicated, of determining whether an offence under military law may have been committed or whether disciplinary proceedings under military law would be justified. This is a role strictly confined to the relevant military legal authorities at brigade or service levels and at the level of the office of director of legal service, the deputy judge advocate general. The ombudsman has no legal power or competence to attempt to make such professional judgments in the area of military law and, for those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I thank Senator Minihan for his intervention but I understand the distinction between military law and the civil code. That is not really what this amendment is about. I also welcome the comments made by Senator Maurice Hayes. What about the situation which existed in a number of barracks in Northern Ireland and England some years ago where particular practices of harassment were taking place against young NCOs? No complaint was made and no action could be determined. The issue only took off when an investigative programme brought it to public attention. That is the type of issue about which I am talking. Given the culture which might exist — this is a particular culture within the Defence Forces — we need to ensure the ombudsman is given the power to initiate an investigation if a matter comes to public attention, otherwise he or she will be neutered in his or her role.My amendment may well be deficient in terms of its limitations, and I would be the first to concede that. However, there needs to be a wider remit if the ombudsman is to be independent. What would happen if, for instance, six months after the appoint of the ombudsman, a major investigative programme came out about a particular practice but no one had complained or there had been no defined action in the case? The ombudsman would be there sitting pretty and could not take on the case and investigate it of his or her own volition. We, as legislators, would be putting the ombudsman in an impossible position.The Minister might consider this amendment again. We want to give the ombudsman the maximum power to use his or her own discretion. In the majority of cases, given the existing parameters in section 4, he or she would be able to make the decision based on the available evidence. Issues of public concern come to public attention from time to time in which the ombudsman should be involved but he or she could not be involved if the legislation, as drafted, goes through the House. I ask the Minister to give this some more thought. I understand the point he makes but that is not the point of the amendment which is about practices coming to the attention of the public where there is no specific complainant and where the issues involved need to be aired.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I defer to Senator Minihan's knowledge of the Army and I am grateful to him for his intervention. These are closed, hierarchical societies. The experience I have had of doctors, policemen and soldiers is that they have all told me their areas are so private and so important that nobody outside can understand them and that they will deal with matters themselves. They should deal with most issues themselves but, increasingly, the professional judgments of closed societies are being doubted by the public. An important part of this is reassurance of the public and of individual members of the Defence Forces.I suggest the Minister might look at the definition of "exception". One does not want the ombudsman ploughing all over the place or setting himself or herself up as an inspector general. One is thinking of a small number of people and of the issue about which Senator Brian Hayes spoke where the malpractice only arose through a plethora of suicides. One could narrowly define that. Perhaps the Minister and the draftspeople could look at the possibility of narrowing and restricting it to definable public interest and at making it clear that it is not an intervention into military law. This might be helpful. It would be a pity if the Minister dismissed it out of hand.

That is my experience.I accept what Senator Maurice Hayes said about closed societies. No one was more frustrated in the Defence Forces than I. The attitude was, close the gates, build the walls higher and let nobody in. I held the opposite point of view, that we should be out selling ourselves and the job we did.As I said on Second Stage, we have to be very careful we do not go down the road of over-civilianising the Army. Armies are different. I do not envisage——

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Senator Brian Hayes should allow me to speak. I am genuinely trying to contribute to the debate by bringing on board my 21 years of experience in the Army which I believe is relevant to the discussion.Things take place in military training that would be in breach of all manner of legislation if they were to take place in civilian training. I would not like to have an ombudsman sitting at home watching a video of a military training exercise in the Glen of Imaal. He would not be happy that the poor soldiers are being shouted at or how they are bullied and harassed. The reality is that one is dealing with people who are commanding lethal forces, not a group of office managers or bank managers. An officer may have to shout and roar at some fellow who has frozen under fire because he wants him to move, either to save his life or the lives of those in the section, platoon, brigade or battalion under his command. That is the way it operates.People are trained in such a manner that they will react to orders and to a particular tone. We cannot have debates and discussions as to whether we should go left, right or up the middle when we are under fire. The commander makes the decision. I would fear for this practice if the military structure is over-civilianised. It is most definitely not to allow the military to hide everything nor to allow the hierarchical command cover up everything. In addition to civil law we have military police, military law and the Defence Act, and now we will have ombudsman legislation, which I welcome.At the end of his contribution, Senator Maurice Hayes asked the Minister to try to address this matter by another means. That is the way to go. The amendment before us would be the wrong way.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	240	This is an interesting debate on a very important point. Unlike Senator Minihan, I have no knowledge of the Defence Forces and I listened with great respect to what he said.We are appointing an ombudsman because there are concerns that one is needed. An ombudsman has been requested. We are responding to a clearly stated need from within the Defence Forces themselves. That is a fact. We did not come up with the idea here. It has come from the organisations themselves. The need for an ombudsman has been clearly stated.By nature, the ombudsman would be independent in his or her functions. An independent office is required and that is what we are putting in place. However, we are limiting its operation which may be for the best, given what Senator Minihan said, that we should not civilianise the military. I accept that point. From time to time, however, there may be a public interest override on certain matters. We need the military to operate as a military force, to be disciplined, effective and ready for whatever action it is required to take in whatever fora and countries the Government decides it should operate.The amendment relates to a public interest override. I agree its wording may not be perfect. In light of what Senator Maurice Hayes said, I urge the Minister to consider the need for a public interest override in the legislation. Will he come back to us on Report Stage with an amendment to insert a public interest override power for the ombudsman? I accept it would only be used in very limited circumstances. It is possible that something could emerge from what clearly is a closed environment, and perhaps by its nature it needs to be so, that an individual or groups within the Defence Forces feel for whatever reason cannot be the subject of a complaint. It is not enough that a matter is investigated inside the military, although that is important and essential. If it is a matter of major public concern people should know that an official outside the Defence Forces is examining the matter and reporting on it in a public manner. This legislation gives us the framework to do that. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to giving the ombudsman the power of initiative in the public interest, should the need arise.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	241	If it were possible I would propose an amendment on the floor. I am only now seeing the limitations of the amendment. An amended version of section 4(3) could read: "The Ombudsman may, if it appears desirable in the public interest to do so and without receiving a complaint, investigate any matter that is brought to his attention." That gives full power to the ombudsman to decide what he should do.The difficulty comes when one starts specifying. I accept the point made by Senator Minihan about this regarding paragraphs (a) and (b). We could just leave it open-ended. He will make a distinction between crackpot cases and genuine ones.Senator Minihan referred to the over-civilianisation of the Defence Forces. I am sure he is aware that under section 2 the person who is the office holder is not a member of the Defence Forces but a civil servant.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	242	That is correct. I accept that.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	243	That is important because he is coming from a totally different perspective.I want to make one point and I may be way off the mark in saying this but when I speak to non-commissioned officers in my constituency, they tell of the upstairs-downstairs attitude that exists. That is part of the problem. People with authority have to use it in a very firm way to ensure discipline, and all the things to which Senator Minihan rightly referred, but sometimes that goes over the mark. We need someone who will have the necessary breadth of experience to tackle these issues but who can also take a case of his own volition. This would be a considerable strength to the office holder who will know the distinction between what is significant and insignificant. The net point is to counter the upstairs-downstairs attitude that, unfortunately, exists. It would give a voice to many people in the Defence Forces who feel that sometimes their voice is ignored when complaints are made.Is the ombudsman a voice for the small men and women of the Army? Yes, but the office is there for a good reason. I would not tie anyone's hands as set out in the existing legislation. We need to be much more flexible. If the Minister tells me there is a better way of putting forward amendment No. 4 than we have done, then I am all ears and will meet him half way. However, I believe we are considering a crucial point in respect of the Bill.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I agree with Senator Minihan as a man of great experience in the Army. The amendment may well have been tabled with a concern for Army personnel in charge of prisoners as against those in command of regular serving ranks. Is the concern based on what has happened elsewhere, as seen on television perhaps, with regard to Army personnel?
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	245	This is an interesting debate and all sides have put forward worthwhile viewpoints, to which the Minister has listened carefully. The most experienced person here is Senator Minihan who has served 21 years with great distinction in the Army. He has great feeling for that particular job. Senator Maurice Hayes, who is a former ombudsman, also brings experience to bear. The appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces is a major step forward. All the different structures, as outlined by Senator Minihan, are still there — the military police, military law, the upper echelons, including the civilian secretariat, and the Minister himself. I am not sure whether the Minister would have any powers to direct the ombudsman to look into any particular area of concern. However, we have gone far enough. Senator Brian Hayes's view is that where there is a difficulty between different ranks it is not the job of the ombudsman to work out the differences arising from the upstairs-downstairs mentality he alleges exists. I have not come across this and believe great respect is shown among serving personnel on all sides in the Army. It would be unnecessary to have such a provision and I believe the Minister should literally stick to his guns on this particular issue.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It has been an informative debate for a civilian such as myself——

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	248	First, I would like to thank Senator Maurice Hayes for giving us the benefit of his vast experience from the position of ombudsman, and also Senator Minihan for giving us his insights on what exactly it is like working inside the military structure. Listening to Senator Minihan I am reminded of what the Duke of Wellington said when he was asked to compare being in charge of a government to being in control of an army. It is a whole different world. I will not give the House the exact quotation.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	252	One of the major concerns relates to when there is some pattern of behaviour that should be investigated, yet people are gripped by fear and cannot come forward. How is that type of situation investigated? What Senator Brian Hayes says is compelling. It would be much more compelling, however, if this debate were taking place before the publication of the Doyle report, Challenge of the Workplace, in 2002. It is fair to say the Doyle report revealed widespread bullying and harassment within the Army and that people were afraid to come forward. There was no proper system of formal or informal complaint. That has changed considerably since the Doyle report. Much has been done in the past two years, as the follow-on report published on 24 September last by my predecessor, Deputy Smith, will show. Having said that, much remains to be done. For example, 200 direct contact persons are now being put in place within the Army. These will be identifiable as people serving personnel may talk to who will listen to problems and respond to them in a non-judgmental fashion, while offering advice on what may be done and where to go. Anybody accused of victimising someone, even if the complaint turns out to be unfounded, will be subject to military discipline in his or her own right.I want to see the Doyle report working its way through the system. Another review will be carried out in two or three years time. When all the report's recommendations are in place, a formal and informal system will exist where anybody with a legitimate complaint need have no fear of intimidation in coming forward. Comparison has been made with the Independent Garda Ombudsman Bill 2001. I was involved in the preparation of that Bill. Deliberately and as a matter of policy, the Garda ombudsman is a dual function office. It is an office where complaints may be lodged about the activities of individual members of the Garda Síochána, but it is also an inspectorate.What has been decided in talks with the Army and its representative associations is that the ombudsman for the military would have one function, which is as a final court of appeal for someone making a complaint. Up to now the final court of appeal was the Minister of Defence or in recent years the officer known as the CIO who would normally make a recommendation to the Minister, which was usually accepted. That system was ultimately deemed unsatisfactory and an ombudsman, along the lines now being proposed, was the preferred solution of the Army and its representative organisations. It is intended here that the ombudsman for the military replace the Minister for Defence as the final court of appeal as regards a complaint which has gone through the system. There was no suggestion at any stage that the Minister, as the final court of appeal, could initiate an investigation. That was not part of the system. It has been agreed to replace the Minister with the ombudsman. The deal is that the ombudsman is the final court of appeal, not that he or she will have an inspectorate role as well. That would be a totally unwarranted extension of his or her duties. I would have no authority, unless I went back to Government, to allow the ombudsman to have this second function.One may argue for and against, but another example occurs to me. Suppose the ombudsman did have the power and went to investigate a particular situation when certain matters came to his or her notice and subsequently a complaint was made. The investigator here will be the final court of appeal. The ombudsman will obviously be influenced already by what has been heard in his or her investigative role. However, it is to the ombudsman that the complainant makes the final appeal. That appears to me to be a difficulty, but perhaps it is one we may get around. I take on board what the Senator is saying, namely, that it might be possible in the most extenuating or exceptional circumstances to give the ombudsman the power to initiate something himself or herself. I am certainly prepared to examine that. I doubt, however, that it will be possible to frame the legislation in such a way as to prevent the ombudsman, in effect, from getting the dual role which the Garda ombudsman has but which nobody intended this office to have in the first place. Nonetheless, I will examine the matter between now and Report Stage.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I thank the Minister for his reply. The net point is that there is a distinct difference between a specific complaint involving a named individual, occurrences, etc., as against the practice. My concern is that bad practices which could be to the detriment of the Defence Forces in the long run, have no likelihood of being exposed if a complainant does not come forward. I believe that the power to investigate, as modified by the Minister if an amendment can be framed, could be useful. An ombudsman would look ridiculous if some practice is exposed to the public within the forces or between the forces and the general public and he or she has to sit on his or her hands, so to speak. I am intent on tabling another amendment on Report Stage to try to make it more specific in terms of defining the public interest. I understand the dilemma the Minister is facing. I will withdraw my amendment with a view to tabling it on Report Stage.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 8, before section 5, to insert the following new section:5.(1) The Ombudsman shall provide the following persons with sufficient information to keep them informed of the progress and results of an investigation under this Act if the investigation resulted from a complaint—(i) the complainant,(ii) the member of the Defence Forces whose conduct is the subject matter of the complaint,(iii) the Adjutant General, and(iv) any other person that the Ombudsman considers has a sufficient interest in the matter.(2) The duties imposed by subsection (1) do not extend to requiring the Ombudsman to provide information the disclosure of which would, in its opinion——(a) prejudice a criminal investigation or prosecution,(b) jeopardise a person’s safety, or(c) for any other reason not be in the public interest.”.This amendment seeks to add a new subsection at the end of the section dealing with the functions of the ombudsman. The ombudsman's functions are clearly set out but one of the aspects he or she should adhere to is the right of people to be kept informed. If a complaint was made against me I would like to know about it in due time. Equally, the complainant needs to be kept informed of the ongoing investigation but there is no reference to that in the Bill. We are attempting to set out, in this section concerning the functions of the ombudsman, a legislative duty that the ombudsman shall keep people informed about the process of an investigation. No one is putting a time limit on that but in the interests of fairness, complainants and those at whom a complaint is directed have a right to know what is going on.We state in subsection (2) paragraph (a) of the amendment that this should not prejudice a criminal investigation or jeopardise a person’s safety. We also refer to the public interest. We believe there is a responsibility on the ombudsman to be fair in terms of the procedures.The Minister might say he intends to do that by way of an instrument but am I right in saying our amendment mirrors section 95 of the Garda Bill he referred to in terms of the duties on the ombudsman to keep people informed of the stage of the complaint in terms of logging the system? If a complaint was made against me and 12 months later I had heard nothing about it, I would be peeved. There is a responsibility on the complainant, and for the person against whom the complaint is directed, to ensure that person is informed of what is taking place. That will ensure fairness and transparency in the new procedure we are setting out.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	259	A technical modification might be necessary to this amendment where Senator Brian Hayes refers to the adjutant general. The position of adjutant general no longer exists in the Defence Forces. Deputy Chief of Staff — Support would be the correct term for the position to which he refers.I am a little surprised by this amendment because a number of sections address the point raised by Senator Hayes. In sections 7(4) and 7(6) there is an onus on the ombudsman to inform. In addition, section 9(2) deals with the conduct of investigations. Senator Hayes said that if a complaint was made against him and he heard nothing for 12 months, he would be peeved. He would be right to feel peeved but I believe that is covered in the section which states that the ombudsman has to report back. The comments made in proposing this amendment are not a fair reflection of the legislation before us.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	260	This amendment proposes to insert into the body of the primary legislation detailed references to matters of administration which I believe would be more properly provided for at the discretion of the ombudsman. We should not micro-manage the investigation system in the primary legislation. The matters referred to do not require an insertion into the primary legislation. As Senator Minihan said, there is broad provision in the Bill in sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(4) and 7(6) and in section 9 as regards the essential aspects of the manner in which the ombudsman is to conduct an investigation.Section 9(3) states: "The procedure for conducting an investigation shall, subject to any regulations under subsection (5), be such as is considered appropriate by the Ombudsman, having regard to all the circumstances concerned.” In other words, procedures should be left to the independent discretion of the ombudsman in each individual case.The provision of relevant updated information about the state of progress of an investigation to relevant parties, as deemed necessary, would be a basic aspect of administration. Such a matter should not be provided for in a mandatory way in primary legislation because each case will depend on its own facts. Generally speaking, everybody will be kept informed and the regulations will provide for that.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 9, subsection (1)(g), line 5, after “Act” to insert “(provided that a complaint may be made within the 12 months immediately following the commencement of this Act regarding an action which is taken before the commencement of this Act)”.This amendment allows for a complaint to be made to the ombudsman in a one-off period of 12 months prior to the enactment of the legislation. In other words, a complaint could be made referring to the period of 12 months before the legislation comes into operation. The Bill, as drafted, prohibits that and therefore anything that happens before the legislation comes into operation is not allowed. It would not be right to have a long period before the legislation is put into operation during which a complaint could be made but this amendment proposes having a one-off period of 12 months before the enactment of the Bill during which period a complaint could be made.I referred earlier to the fact that the Bill is two years in gestation, which is not long by any means, but that is the period from which the principle was agreed, particularly with the representative bodies. We are of the opinion that the provision allowed for in this amendment would create a greater level of fairness and confidence in the operation of the Bill.I read the Official Report of Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, with reference to this amendment in particular, and I note that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, did not give us a commitment in regard to it. I hope this Minister will bring his own point of view to it.We are not referring to complaints about something that happened 20 years ago. I note the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, referred to that saying that new Deputies would highlight problems that could not be solved over the years. I think I know what he was referring to. It was a particular issue that arose in the constituency, of which we all had experience, that did relate to the Defence Forces but under which a line was drawn for a number of reasons. I am not referring to that. We want to provide for a period of 12 months before the enactment of the legislation in order to make the enactment of the Bill as fair as possible.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I listened carefully to what Senator O'Meara said. As I understand it her intention is to allow people to go back with complaints which originate within the 12-month period before the commencement of the Bill. The difficulty is in the way her amendment is drafted where it states, "a complaint may be made within the 12 months immediately following the commencement of this Act regarding an action which is taken before the commencement of this Act". Presumably that would enable one to go back to 1922. I take it that is not——

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Yes, indeed. In regard to a complaint made about an action where that action predates the commencement of this legislation, the revised Bill incorporating ministerial amendments provides that such a complaint can still be referred to the Minister under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954 as at present. I draw the Senator's attention to the comprehensive ministerial amendment to section 13 of the Bill as originally published. The amendment as proposed would have the effect that a complaint could be referred to the ombudsman concerning any action which predated the commencement of the new legislation provided only that the complaint is made within 12 months of the date of commencement. I realise this may not be the Senator's intention.Apart from the impracticality of persons potentially making complaints to the new ombudsman about alleged actions which may have occurred many decades ago, this amendment would also be inconsistent with the existing provisions of section 6(3) which places a time limit of 12 months from the date of an action or of the complainant's awareness of an action within which the complainant may submit a complaint.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 9, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following new subsection:"(4) In this section 'serving member' means—(i) a person in the service of the Defence Forces, including a recruit;(ii) a former active member, including a former recruit;(iii) a retired member;(iv) applicants to the Defence Forces; and(v) a civil servant in the service of the Defence Forces.".We propose to enlarge the definition of the term "serving member". We are aware of the legislation in Canada as referred to earlier which grants much greater eligibility to people wishing to make specific complaints to the ombudsperson or ombudsman. Can the Minister tell me whether the term is ombudsman or ombudsperson?

I am not suggesting that because one was not selected as part of the officer group for 2005 one should immediately complain to the ombudsman but there may be circumstances in which people felt they had been dealt with unfairly in their dialogue with the Defence Forces. We include the category of recruits or former recruits and applicants. In the Canadian model there is a much wider definition of complainants than in this section. I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	276	A recruit is a member of the Defence Forces, as distinct from the Canadian system, or even the Garda system whereby a garda in the Garda college is a student, as distinct from being a member of the Garda Síochána. There is a clear distinction. It is only in phase 3 that he or she becomes a member of the Garda Síochána. Before a recruit puts on the uniform he or she is attested as a member of the Defence Forces. Once a person is in the service of the Defence Forces, whether he or she is a recruit, an officer or NCO, he or she is a member of the Defence Forces, there is no distinction. There is such a distinction in the Garda Síochána.In regard to the phrase "a former active member" I thought all members of the Defence Forces were active. I hope they are because if not they should not be in it. In regard to the term "former recruit" the legislation covers former members of the Defence Forces so I do not understand that. It also covers retired members. If Senator Hayes succeeds with this amendment I will have many complaints going back to my cadet days in 1975.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	277	If the Senator continues talking I might complain about him myself.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The only place "applicants to the Defence Forces" will encounter the Defence Forces is through the interview process. If the case is so severe and the traumatic interview has taken so much out of him or her, then he or she can go to the Ombudsman, as distinct from the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The legislation also covers the civil servant. Perhaps Senator Brian Hayes would like to clarify his amendment for us.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I too find the amendment somewhat tautologous in that I wonder what is the difference between a former member and a retired member. I take issue with Senator Minihan on the question of applicants. They should have somewhere to go.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Very well. Several complaints arise out of that process. I would be uneasy too about the inclusion of a civil servant in that section because civil servants come under the remit of the Ombudsman and it should be left that way. Otherwise an ambiguity arises as to where the civil servant addresses complaints. The last thing one wants is a form of ombudsman shopping. It would be better to be silent on that point and leave it as it is.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The proposed amendment concerns the prescribed categories of person who may complain to the Defence Forces ombudsman. The published legislation provides that complaints may be made to the Defence Forces ombudsman by serving and former members of the Defence Forces, subject to the other governing terms in the legislation. A complaint may be made in respect of a matter internal to the Defence Forces where the complainant feels adversely affected. The general body of serving members and former members of the Defence Forces will be able to utilise this legislation and to access the Defence Forces ombudsman as provided for in the legislation. This includes recruits and cadets. There is no reason civilians who have never served in the Defence Forces would need to make an application to the Defence Forces ombudsman regarding internal defence force matters.Civilians have recourse to the Ombudsman for the public service and to the Minister on matters concerning the Department of Defence and the Civil Service. Typical examples would be queries about civilian employee pensions, matters connected with property owned by the Department of Defence and civilian applications to join the Defence Forces. None of these matters is proper to the specific role of the new Defence Forces ombudsman. In particular, the Defence Forces ombudsman legislation is not relevant to civilian employees of the Department as those individuals are non-established civilian employees of the Department of Defence.Many are craftsmen while others perform various clerical functions in stores and so on. While they work with the Defence Forces their employment is subject to the normal body of civil employment legislation. They enjoy exactly the same employment rights as all other non-established State employees employed by the Office of Public Works and by certain other Departments. Their interests are represented by recognised trade unions at the joint industrial council for non-established State industrial employees of Departments. They are not subject to military law or discipline. In light of the entirely comprehensive nature of the provisions of the published legislation I must reject this amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	283	There is no protection here for whistleblowers. Compared to many EU countries our legislation is deficient in this area. I can think of a category of civil servants working regularly with the Army who might well come forward on any matter with which they are dealing and bring it to the attention of a new ombudsman which would have a direct impact on how the force is governed and run and the immediate recourse open to them is through the existing Ombudsman. This amendment, albeit with some of its defects modified, would be of benefit to whistleblowers. As the Minister knows, the Government made a commitment to introduce such legislation but has not done so yet. This is the kind of provision that would help whistleblowers tell their stories if they saw something peculiar or irregular.I am glad Senator Maurice Hayes raised the issue of applicants. A consistent bone of contention for many people is how they can get into the Army and particularly into the senior ranks. Nobody should be concerned if a light were shone on that area. All kinds of allegations were made in the past, most of them unfounded, about political involvement. Applicants form a very important category and should be allowed to make complaints in this area. Senator Minihan said they could go through the existing Ombudsman framework. However, we are now appointing an ombudsman to deal with all aspects of the Defence Forces. Earlier we debated how broad and free-ranging we wanted the new ombudsman's role to be. We still have no whistle-blowing legislation; if we did we would have no need for this amendment, particularly as it refers to the fifth category of a civil servant in the service of the Defence Forces.Some years ago my colleague, former Deputy Charles Flanagan, chaired an all-party committee of both Houses that issued a report recommending the abolition of the commitment civil servants are required to make under the Official Secrets Act. This is now redundant and prevents people coming forward with information that could be in the public interest. Irrespective of the comments of Senator Minihan, I contend that particularly as it relates to the fifth category, an argument can be made for whistle blowing and this is the vehicle through which it can be done.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Recruits and cadets are enlisted serving members. Applicants can apply to the public services Ombudsman. They can complain to the Minister for Defence in general terms in the first instance. The Ombudsman might insist on that because all other avenues must be exhausted before going to the Ombudsman. No civil servant is in the service of the Defence Forces. They are civil servants of the Minister. While I take Senator Brian Hayes's point about whistleblowers, the matter was raised on the Order of Business in the Dáil this morning and that legislation is imminent. That is the best way to deal with the issue. A significant number of people have recourse to the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. Senator Brian Hayes will know that under the existing system, the Minister as the final court of appeal was only available to enlisted personnel. For the first time we have moved a considerable distance beyond that. I believe we have found the right balance.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 13, subsection 3(a), lines 26 to 27, to delete “to the public interest or”.Again in this section the devil is in the detail. This section refers to secrecy, which is very important in the context of the Defence Forces. I suppose it is the Minister's right to withhold information. The principle is very important and clearly must be contained in the legislation. I am concerned over the extent of the Minister's authority to withhold information. Section 10(3)(a) states: “The Minister may give notice in writing to the Ombudsman, with respect to any document ... that would, for the reasons stated in the notice, be prejudicial to the public interest or to security.”This relates to defence and military matters. One can understand that the Minister should have power to withhold information, documents, etc. in the interest of security. I am concerned at the inclusion of the words "public interest" in this section. I note that no definition of "public interest" exists. We approached this from a different angle when discussing Senator Brian Hayes's earlier amendment on the role of the ombudsman. At the time I commented that a public interest override should exist and on Report Stage I intend to table an amendment giving the ombudsman that power.In this section the public interest is referred to in an entirely different context by stating that the Minister may withhold information in the public interest. However, I assume the Minister must decide what is the public interest, as the legislation does not do so. This may be defined in other legislation. I know that during the drafting of the freedom of information legislation by my colleague, former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, with whom I worked at the time, much discussion took place about having a public interest override in the context of whistleblowers as referred to by Senator Brian Hayes. However, this section gives the Minister the authority to decide what he or she would withhold in the public interest. That is a very broad power and should not be contained in this legislation; hence my amendment to delete it.The amendment does not propose changing the Minister's right to withhold information in the interest of security as clearly that provision makes sense. However, I am concerned that the Minister is being given far too much power to withhold information from the ombudsman.Section 10(3)(a) states, “The Minister may give notice in writing”, and not, “shall give notice in writing.” What would happen if the Minister does not give notice in writing? How is the public to know what is being withheld? It is important that the public has a way to know what has generally been withheld. This would allow somebody, probably the ombudsman, to let us know in response to a query the extent of withholding of information by the Minister in any particular complaint.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Section 10(3)(a) prescribes the powers of the Minister to give written notice to the Defence Forces ombudsman to preclude disclosure other than to the ombudsman and his office any specified documentation, information, etc., on grounds that any such disclosure would be prejudicial to the public interest or security. The Senator’s amendment seeks to remove the public interest ground. In the first instance the section specifically requires the Minister to provide within the written notice to the ombudsman a written——
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The section states "may" and not "shall".
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	288	—— statement as to why, in the opinion of the Minister, that disclosure would be prejudicial to the public interest or to security. Section 10 deals with the important matter of secrecy of information, a sensitive matter given that the Defence Forces ombudsman will by definition be involved in the investigation of complaints originating in the military environment. Notwithstanding this, there is a desire to apply a liberal interpretation to the practical remit of the ombudsman as provided for in the legislation. While a pending investigation might potentially involve touching upon some tangential aspect of military security, I would generally be reluctant to preclude the ombudsman from carrying out an investigation into a complaint merely on that tangential ground alone. However, as a concomitant defence for much wider general interest the legislation must provide appropriate safeguards against disclosure of certain types of information the disclosure of which, in the opinion of the Minister of the day, would be detrimental to that wider general public interest.Senator O'Meara mentioned that the section states "may".
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Yes. Section 10(3)(a) states, “The Minister may give notice in writing.”
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I will examine that issue. My intention is that the Minister will have to give notice in writing of his reasons for asking the ombudsman to suppress the information. I will consider that point.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thank the Minister, especially for his last remark which makes a major difference. It is fair enough that the Minister will have to tell the ombudsman what is being suppressed and why he is requiring it to be suppressed. The broad issue is that the Minister will be allowed to suppress information in "the public interest", even though we do not know what that public interest involves. The public interest must exist because it is being referred to in this legislation——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Without definition.

The Minister could actually make it up. The public interest has not been specified. The Minister might say he is suppressing it in the public interest, but we will be relying on the Minister's personal interpretation of the public interest. It is much too broad.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The ombudsman will be given the power to challenge that if he or she so wishes.

I will withdraw the amendment for the moment. I will see what the Minister has to say on Report Stage and consider my options then.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 16, subsection (2), line 4, to delete "in the Civil Service of the State".This has been a rather fallow afternoon for Opposition Senators, but the Minister may choose to accept these amendments. The wording of this section is an example of verbiage, which the Minister does not like. Section 14(2) states, "a member of the staff of the Ombudsman shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State." I am not aware of any civil servant who is not a civil servant of the State, although someone may be able to point out such a civil servant to me. We need to remove such verbiage. I propose that section 14 (2) be amended so that it states, "a member of the staff of the Ombudsman shall be a civil servant."I have tabled amendment No. 10 because I believe that, like amendment No. 9, it gives greater definition to the Bill. I propose to delete section 14(5), which states, "In this section "civil servant in the Civil Service of the State" means a person holding a position in the Civil Service of the State"." That is inconsistent with section 36 of the Civil Defence Act 2002, from which I have taken the wording of my amendment No. 10, which proposes to replace the words to be deleted with, "in this section 'civil servant' means a person appointed within the meaning of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956." I think the Minister can give way on this issue because my wording is much clearer and cuts out the verbiage.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I am a fully paid-up member of the plain English society. There seems to be some confusion about the definition of the term "civil servant". The Bill provides generally that the term "civil servant" has the meaning assigned to it by the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Yes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	303	That is the same definition as that in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and the Ombudsman Act 1980.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Yes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Section 14 of the Bill deals specifically with civil servants who will be employed in the new office of the ombudsman of the Defence Forces. The provisions of the section reflect the corresponding provisions of section 10 of the Ombudsman Act 1980 and section 21 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 in providing that, "a member of staff of the Ombudsman shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State", as opposed to a civil servant of the Government, the latter being typically a civil servant working in a line Department under a Minister.Senator Brian Hayes's amendment would mean that the circumstances of those working in the office of the Defence Forces ombudsman would be different from the circumstances of those working in the offices of the other two existing statutory ombudsmen to which I have referred. While I accept that the language proposed by Senator Hayes is better, I regret that I cannot accept his amendments because I have difficulties with their content. To put it simply, it would not be acceptable for somebody who is a member of staff of the office of the Defence Forces ombudsman to be a servant of the Minister for Defence. I do not think that would be appropriate.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I accept the Minister's argument that there are two categories — civil servants who work in line Departments and civil servants who work elsewhere.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am referring to the latter category in my amendment. It does not make any sense to refer to "a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State." The definition I have proposed is much more precise. I might return to this matter on Report Stage, but I will withdraw my amendment now so that we can conclude our consideration of all the amendments at 5 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 17, before section 18, to insert the following new section:"18.—Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall cause to be published a further version of the Defence Acts Restatement which shall incorporate this Act.".The new section proposed in this amendment calls on the Minister after this Bill has been passed to amend the Defence Acts restatement, which was published by his Department as an attempt to codify all the legislation in a particular Department's remit. In fairness to the Department of Defence — the Minister can take his hat off in this regard — it was one of the first Departments to produce a codified book of legislation under the Government's consolidated legislative proposals. The excellent restatement book will become outdated after this Bill has been passed because it will not include the consequent new Act. The proposed new section states, "within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall cause to be published a further version of the Defence Acts Restatement which shall incorporate this Act". I will withdraw my amendment if the Minister responds by saying that will be done anyway. The intention of my amendment is to prod the Minister in that direction.

A comprehensive restatement of the Defence Acts 1954 to 1998 and the Courts Martial Appeals Act 1983 was published some months ago. It is intended that the general body of the Defence Acts should be the subject of critical review and scrutiny in the immediate future with a view to determining if, where and to what extent new legislation might be required, given that the original parent Defence Act 1954 is now 50 years old.The Bill before the House amends one section of the 1954 Act — section 13 of the Bill amends section 114 of the 1954 Act. Having discussed the matter with the Attorney General, we have been told that another restatement of the Defence Acts could not be justified at this stage on the basis of administrative best practice or the more basic matter of sensible cost efficiency. In any event, the Attorney General has advised us that it would be entirely inappropriate to insert a section in new legislation compelling the undertaking of a restatement exercise within a specific period of time.

The Bill before the House amends just one section of the Defence Act 1954. It should not require a significant amount of imagination, ability or insight to read the substantial existing restatement in conjunction with a single additional Act. We will be conscious of this issue if we have to legislate further in this area. We are aware of the need to have law in restated form. We will pursue the consolidation exercise further, but this is not the appropriate time to do so, especially as further matters have to be addressed. Senator Hayes is familiar with the body of equality legislation, for example. Helping to bring the Equality Act 2004 through the Dáil was my last achievement as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I found it difficult to come to terms with it — it is an absolute nightmare. The body of legislation in that area badly needs to be restated. Matters of that nature will have to take priority.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I appreciate the Minister's intention to restate the legislation. This is important because it is public business. Everyone must know that the ombudsman is in place and be able to read the legislation in plain English. I appreciate the Minister saying that, at the first available opportunity, the restatement will appear again in amended form.

I have known Deputy Seán Power for many years. Our fathers were acquaintances, to put it mildly, in Fianna Fáil circles in County Kildare, so he is particularly welcome. With all the nuances of politics, I wish him well in his ministerial office. He is more than capable of doing a good job, and I hope that he is allowed to do so.I move:That Seanad Éireann, noting that the number of persons holding medical cards is more than 100,000 less than it was in 1997, and recalling the promise before the 2002 election to provide 200,000 extra medical cards, condemns the decision by the Government to abandon that election commitment and calls for:(1) an immediate commitment to restore the number of medical cards to that extant in 1997,(2) to provide the promised additional 200,000 and(3) to outline a timetable for the introduction of a comprehensive system of primary health care which is free at point of use.I was entertained by a little piece on the RTE web news today in which the Tánaiste appealed to Opposition parties not to play politics with problems regarding delayed heart surgery in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin. I can only say that when Ministers stop claiming credit for anything good that happens in the health services, those of us in Opposition will stop raising everything wrong with them.The motion deals with the number of people who have ceased to have medical cards and the failure to implement a very explicit promise to extend the number of such cards. I intend to deal with the entire issue. I remember something that used to cause great hilarity in my house when my children were small. When they were having their fun and wanted to run around a little, Daddy used to cover his eyes with a blindfold and pretend to chase them around. Of course, being blindfolded, he could not see where he was going. Were it not for the human suffering involved, watching the Government's performance on medical cards would provide the rest of us with some similar entertainment. Once it had put its ideological blindfold on, it could never really manage to do anything properly regarding the health services, and that is what has happened; it has let ideology get in its way. The Tánaiste is now reaching the stage where she is defensive about the whole suggestion. She is not an ideologue but a pragmatist, and I may return to that theme later.Let us deal with the indisputable facts. The percentage of the population that holds medical cards has dropped dramatically in the seven years that the Government has been in power, from perhaps 39% of the population to perhaps 27%. What is beyond doubt is that approximately 100,000 medical cards have effectively been withdrawn, since people have ceased to be eligible. It is worth putting on the record the income levels under which one is eligible for a medical card — it is a matter of opinion whether one is entitled. The threshold is €206.50 per week for a married couple and €26 for each additional child. The position for a single person is not even clear-cut, but it is approximately €142 per week.The legislation under which medical cards were introduced makes it clear that such a card is meant to be available to someone where it would cause undue hardship for him or her to have to pay for GP services and drugs bills. The spin-off from the medical card system has been an enormous improvement in the dignity of those holding one over the previous dispensary doctor system in which people were stereotyped. It is perhaps the most effective and visible area where everyone has access to what is essentially the same service, subject to the one major caveat of money. Most people going into a doctor's surgery to see a GP have no way of knowing whether the person in front or behind in the queue is paying the doctor or has a medical card. That is a very progressive position.However, the number of couples in this State who have an income below €206.50 has, thankfully, dropped. It is a very good thing that the proportion of our population on that sort of income has fallen. The proportion of the population with an individual income of less than €142 a week has also, thankfully, dropped. Let us all celebrate that happy situation as the achievement of sensible economic policies pursued by a succession of Governments going back to the late 1980s. However, as we have all become prosperous, doctors have sought to share in the prosperity, so that the price one pays for going to see a GP has gone up not at the rate of inflation but at the rate at which incomes have risen. It is probably a little unreasonable to suggest that GPs should have done other than increase their fees in line with the aspirations of society at large. Now a couple with two children, one of whom is working full time and another part time on the minimum wage, and with an income of €380 a week, are in our legislation and culture, and behind our ideological blindfold, presumed to be able to pay for medical care for themselves and their children without undue hardship.This means that if they go to a GP they should be able to pay a sum between €35 and €50. Later on that week, if one of the children gets an infection along with a bad headache — the warnings about meningitis appear on television — the parents may bring the child back to the GP and pay perhaps another €40. The child then turns out to be suffering not from meningitis but from an ordinary infection which necessitates a prescription. Prescriptions are expensive and the parents may have to pay €50 or €60. In a one-week period, it is therefore not unreasonable to say that a couple earning less than €400 would have to fork out €50 for a doctor, perhaps twice in a bad week in the winter, when children get sick.We all know how quickly children get sick and how one worries about them. The couple, one of whom might be earning the average industrial wage and the other working on a part-time basis, must pay €150 out of their week's income. Our dominant political culture, as exhibited by the Government which has been in power for seven years of unprecedented prosperity, has resulted in that being seen as acceptable.One Member from the other side of the House said to me that I should be celebrating people's escape from dependence on the State because they no longer had medical cards. The ESRI report published yesterday made it clear what this escape from dependence meant, namely, that when people moved marginally above the income eligibility limit for a medical card, the average number of visits to a GP dropped from 6.6 per annum to 3.6 per annum. Neither figure is excessive. An average rate of six or seven visits per annum to a GP for someone on a medical card is not excessive. What we have is a deliberate decision to leave eligibility alone. That is why the amendment is so intellectually offensive. It gives the impression that something very positive happened accidentally, namely, that incomes went up.The income levels for eligibility for medical cards are not written in stone. The Government could have doubled the income allowance for children and for couples, for whom it could have increased the allowance by 50%. There was no reason not to except that getting people off the medical cards saved money and created the illusion that more money was available for other elements of the health service. Ultimately, it was a matter not of resources, of which there is no shortage in this State, but of an ideologically driven view of how a health service should run, namely, that as many people as possible should be driven out of public health care into private health care, since it is for this that the Government stands.Having the resources and the money, the Government could have afforded to do something about medical cards. It chose different priorities, leaving a significant gap and great hardship for young working families with young children for whom every hint of illness in the family is a threat of imminent hardship because of the scale of the costs involved and the absence of proper public support.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	321	It is with great pleasure that I second the motion. I understand that the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, will attend the House later to speak on the motion and I welcome that. When she took over the Department, one of her first remarks was to note how the income threshold for the medical card had fallen and that it should be addressed. While I welcome that, the question has occurred to me as to where she has been for the past seven years. She has been sitting in the Cabinet which made the decision not to increase the income thresholds for the medical card. She has been sitting in the Cabinet responsible for the fact that fewer people now have medical cards and that people are in some cases facing serious hardship because they are over the income limit for a medical card.Although there are many public representatives in both Houses aware of the hardship caused by the stinginess of the Government regarding this issue, and its failure in this as in other matters to live up to its promises, I will confine my remarks to Members in this House. We sit in our offices and clinics, meeting people who are struggling and cannot afford to go to the doctor. Senator Ryan has pointed that out graphically.Children in poor families are one of the groups suffering. This morning I attended a budget briefing in the Mansion House by the End Poverty Coalition. That is an umbrella group for a large number of voluntary organisations working with children, including Barnardos, the largest charity, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Children's Rights Alliance, etc. They have already made their budget submission and they consider it an absolute priority that the medical card income limits be extended. They feel the medical card should be widely available to children and they state that we can afford to make them available.Poor families suffer from ill-health and that has been so in this country for a considerable period. In the past ten years in particular, and specifically in more recent years, we have had the resources to ensure that we can tackle disadvantage and poverty and deal with the fact that poor people suffer ill-health. This Government has chosen not to do so.I have previously listened carefully to the comments of the Tánaiste, now also the Minister for Health and Children, and will listen carefully to her this evening because there seems to be a realisation that there is a problem. Whether that realisation is linked to results in the local elections of last June remains to be seen, but the budget will be a benchmark of the commitment of the Government to tackle the very serious issues facing us, particularly those related to poverty.Another group comprises old age pensioners who are not yet 70 and have thus not reached the age of automatic entitlement to a medical card. They are aged between 66 and 70 and their pensions put them over the threshold for the medical card. I have met a number of these people, who live in fear of being ill because of what it can cost to visit a doctor.Another group is single people on low incomes. They might be in their 20s and perhaps not supporting a family and children. They are over the income limit for a medical card but because they are on low incomes, they cannot afford to go to GPs.I apologise for neglecting to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House. I congratulate him on his appointment and we are pleased to have him attend the House. I put it to him, however, that we are paying an economic cost for the fear of single people on low incomes to visit a GP because of a simple lack of funds. These people must instead resort to an accident and emergency unit and we are approaching the winter when such units will come under even more pressure. It was noted in previous years that people used hospital outpatient departments because they could not afford to go to a GP. They are part of the significant number of people queuing in hospital outpatient departments, sometimes for days, for treatment which could possibility be administered at primary care level.The second economic cost relates to those who do not attend a GP because of their lack of income and who leave an illness until such time as it may require hospital care, leading to absence from work and decreased productivity. We are short-sighted in our approach to this issue, given that the Government is so clearly committed to economic productivity, which is not bad in itself but should not come at the cost of people's health.I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. There is no doubt policy on medical cards is not only leading to hardship but contributes to an increasingly two-tiered society in which, if one is on a low-income, one is effectively consigned to a life of hardship and one's ability to get out of the poverty trap is impaired.On Monday last The Guardian commented on the British Government’s stated policy of getting people back to work, which is a good policy. However, the newspaper noted that simply being back at work does not deal with the issue of poverty because of the problem of low income. Those in low income jobs need supports similar to supports received by those in other employment. We must also consider the position of low income families at work, in particular the implications for children. While there is a serious housing problem, I will confine my remarks to the subject of debate, which is related to health.The medical card is an important instrument in assisting those in poverty and is particularly important for the children of poor families. In that regard, it is a serious public policy issue. I hope the Government is rethinking its policy and that the days of stinginess are over. In particular, I hope the days of assuming that somebody on a medical card visits a GP for the sake of it are also over. The figures show that people visit doctors when they are ill. Unfortunately, due to Government policy, many people are ill who cannot afford to see their doctors.

I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment to office. I am sure he will be a great success in his new role.I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:"notes with approval the unprecedented levels of growth that have been and are being experienced in the Irish economy and the consequential rise in employment levels. Seanad Éireann also notes, that a consequence of these higher employment levels is that fewer people qualify for medical cards and commends the Government for its measures which enable persons returning to the work force after long-term unemployment to retain the medical card for three years and for its commitment in the programme for Government to extend medical card eligibility further.I welcome the debate and look forward to the contribution of the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. She excelled in her previous portfolio and I am sure she will have the same level of success in her new position.I agree with the Minister's recent statement that we must reconsider the question of medical card eligibility. It is far too low and has undoubtedly slipped back significantly in recent years. Senator Ryan stated that GP consultancy fees have increased substantially, which is the case. However, it is important to note that the Government introduced the minimum wage for the first time although I do not claim that this is wonderful as it should have happened long ago.It is also important to note that medical cards are an income-related facility. In tandem with the provisions of section 45 of the Health Act 1970, the chief executive officer of a health board has certain discretionary powers in regard to those who exceed the guidelines, which were reviewed in January last. The question of medical evidence plays an important part in the case of those who are ineligible for a medical card due to a medical condition. Even where the medical evidence precludes the applicant from qualifying for a medical card, the chief executive officer can, if he or she considers there is financial hardship, grant a medical card.For those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are schemes such as the long-term illness scheme and the drug payments scheme. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person not eligible for a medical card will definitely not be awarded that card. In over 25 years in public life, I have dealt with many cases in which a claimant was outside the guidelines but, because of financial difficulties, was allowed a medical card.Students who are financially independent of their parents are also entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right. There was a time when students were entitled to a medical card but a Labour Party Minister for Health discontinued this.

Senator Ryan is a member of a party with a moving policy — it makes it up as it goes along. However, those of us who live in the real world must deal with the facts as they are.It is open to all persons to apply through the chief executive of a health board for a medical card if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In line with the health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, the possibility of extending the medical card by statute to various groups is undergoing ongoing review in the Department in the context of the strategy's second goal. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. It is a fact that there are and have been inequalities and while much work has been done in this regard, more needs to be done.I agree with Senator Ryan that the time is past when people trailed into the surgeries despite everybody knowing the situation. The medical card scheme, the GMS and the choice of doctor scheme were innovative policies which should be welcomed by all right-thinking people. Health board chief executive officers have discretion in regard to the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility.Reference was made to the number of medical cards which have been discontinued. As it is an income-related facility, it is to the credit of this Government and the incoming Minister for Health and Children, who brought many more people into the workforce, that people are now in the workforce playing their part in society and are therefore falling outside the eligibility terms for medical cards.Although a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded by a health board chief executive officer. The health strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from a review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card application process to ensure more fairness and transparency. There were many difficulties in dealing with applications that I as a public representative dealt with over many years by providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards.As somebody with a background in the area of health I am aware that there are people who can afford to go to a doctor, or people who have medical cards, who will not go to a doctor for reasons best known to themselves. One reason that has been put forward is that they might not like what the doctor might have to say. I do not know whether that is true.The Department of Health and Children is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the whole legal framework for eligibility and entitlement in regard to health services. There are 768,895 medical cards at the moment, covering 1,151,106 people. That is just under 30% of the population. However, it must be recognised that many of the people who had medical cards have entered the workforce and are now ineligible for a medical card.

However, the terms have been adjusted every year. That must also be conceded.In 2003 payments under the GMS to general practitioners in respect of capitation fees and allowances amounted to €286.8 million. Many cards were withdrawn because of duplication. In addition, many people are now outside the terms of eligibility for a medical card because they have been inducted into the workforce as a result of the policies of the incoming Minister. That must be appreciated and welcomed because nothing compares to the dignity of work.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children. His appointment was welcomed in Kildare although it is a point of contention that we in Carlow-Kilkenny got no Minister. However, it is the new Minister's moment of glory and I wish him well in his new job. I hope he will not forget about Carlow.This motion is very appropriate. I am glad the Government parties are not querying the need to do something in this area. It should be borne in mind that people on the minimum wage will not qualify for a medical card. That is the bottom line. I accept the point Senator Glynn makes regarding people being back at work. However, we all see people in our clinics who are barely outside the eligibility criteria for medical cards and we also fight cases for them. Most are subsequently granted a medical card. Unfortunately, some are not. Many people are put off and do not bother applying because they do not realise they can apply for one based on medical condition if their income is in excess of the strict financial limit.A married couple with an income of €206.50 a week who are under the age of 66 cannot qualify for a medical card. If someone on an income of €206.50 a week needs to go to a doctor — the going rate in Carlow is at least €45 — then to a pharmacy where the cost of drugs will be at least €40, and make a return visit to the doctor at €45, the total expenditure is at least €120, more than half their income. That is the real issue.As a public representative it annoys me when people who have had a medical card for years are cut off for some reason and must go through the whole process of applying for a new medical card, arguing their case, invariably on medical grounds. They are then granted a card, but months will have elapsed and in the meantime they will have amassed huge medical bills and have wasted the health board's time because the staff in the health board must deal with an issue they should not have to deal with. I ask the Minister to ensure that if somebody with an ongoing medical condition has a medical card it is renewed automatically. It would save everyone time and effort and ensure people do not run up expensive bills.I had a case in Carlow recently of a constituent who has severe medical problems, whose daughter has only one kidney and also suffers major medical problems, failing to qualify for a medical card. I was successful in arguing a case for them, but they endured months during which they did not have a medical card and ran up huge bills in the meantime. That should not be allowed to happen. One message I hope the Minister will take away from this debate is that people with an ongoing medical condition which has been proven and who have a medical card should not be forced to apply for a medical card every year. It is unnecessary.The Government's record on health is atrocious. I welcome the appointment of Deputy Harney as Minister for Health and Children. The previous Minister, Deputy Martin, did not do his job. He fudged every issue he could. He commissioned report after report but did not enact many of their provisions. All he did was write further reports on the reports. I hope that when the new Minister gets up to speed in the Department she will take decisions and implement them. Her predecessor did not do so and we are suffering as a result. I hope the Minister will not commission any more reports. We have plenty of reports. I am sure the Minister of State must have shelves of reports in his office which he will never read. I hope that all the reports that have been written will be implemented.In 1997 and in 2002, a clear promise was given by the Government to increase the number of medical card holders by 200,000. It is appalling there are now almost 100,000 fewer card holders. That is even more remarkable when one considers that in the meantime all people over 70 years automatically qualified. There is no doubt that many of those people deserve to have a medical card. However, there are many people over the age of 70 years who could afford private medical care and do not need a medical card. That is a big difficulty.I urge the Government to give careful consideration to giving medical cards in respect of children under four years of age. Based on my experience with my nephews and niece the difficult period for children seems to be between birth and four years of age. After the age of four years, children tend not to get sick as much. When they are older they might fall out of a tree and break a leg but that is an occasional mishap. Invariably if there are three or four children in a family and one gets sick there is almost a guarantee that the other two or three will also get sick. It puts a huge strain on families if they have to go to the doctor with three or four children, to the pharmacy for drugs and then to the doctor for a repeat visit. The Government should, therefore, consider giving those under four years of age a medical card and prioritising medical cards for the elderly who have an ongoing medical condition. Those who need medical cards most should be targeted. I am terrified of a free-for-all system. With respect to Dr. Michael Smurfit, as he is over 70 years of age, he would be entitled to a medical card. All Members will agree that he does not need it as much as a woman with a family on the minimum wage. Anomalies in the system need to be addressed.The national health strategy, published in 2001, promised an investment of over €1 billion in primary care yet three years after its publication only €16 million has been spent. The Department only refers to ten pilot projects when 600 primary care centres were promised by 2012. Badly needed funding for primary care is being withheld until 2007. This morning my local radio station held a discussion on medical cards where the point was made that last year income levels were not increased. Another disastrous decision that the Minister must take into account is that of former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who raised the threshold level for the drug refund scheme. While the medical card threshold has remained the same, accident and emergency charges and the drug refund scheme threshold have increased, a double slap in the face.Yesterday's ESRI report on health provides food for thought. It claimed medical card holders only attend their GPs 6.6 times a year, validating Senator Ryan's point about the misconception that they go to the doctor every day of the week. People in private care attend 3.5 times a year. This indicates that the cut-off level is wrong. People are harming themselves by not going to the doctor because they cannot afford to do so. This has a knock-on effect on absenteeism from work which IBEC recently highlighted. I urge the Minister to increase the threshold level for medical cards and consider giving cards to all under four year olds. Those on the minimum wage must qualify for medical cards. Those who already hold medical cards, and whose medical circumstances have not changed, should not be forced to renew their applications. It is unnecessary and time consuming for everyone involved.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I am delighted to speak on this motion and I welcome the Tánaiste's appointment to the health portfolio. While the health service is one of the major issues of debate, we should remember that our health service, when compared internationally, is a very good one. I admit there are problems but since 1997 the coalition Government has endeavoured to address these in many ways. Various reports on health reform have been compiled and are now in their implementation phases. The Progressive Democrats, along with our Government partners, are confident that when we face the electorate, it will be seen that we have delivered on the commitments made to health service reform. Members have argued that if the reform of the health service were purely a question of money, we would have a health service second to none. Members should recall that €10 billion is now spent on health care compared to €3 billion in 1997. If we had known then that €10 billion would be spent by 2004, our health service would now be second to none. However, this is not just about money.The medical card system can be looked at as a glass half full or half empty. It must be acknowledged that many people's standard of living has increased to such a point that they can forfeit their entitlement to a medical card. That is not to say there will not be people on the threshold who find themselves ineligible. The introduction of the minimum wage should be used as a benchmark for society. If one is below the minimum wage, one should be ineligible for taxation and entitled to those services provided by the State such as medical cards. Hopefully, this will be achieved some day.Any examination of the medical card system must be done in the wider context of the operation of the GMS scheme. Between 1997 and 2003, the scheme's budget increased from €303 million to €938 million. Much of this additional investment was required due to increases in drug costs, the demands from a growing population and an increase in the number of general practitioners operating in the scheme from 1,600 to approximately 2,200.The Government introduced medical card eligibility for those over 70 years as an assurance that they can, without fear of financial restraint, approach doctors for medical care. Approximately 1.15 million people are covered by medical cards. While I admit this is a lower figure than previous years, it can be explained by our changed economic circumstances. Many people are no longer eligible on means grounds. The management of the medical card scheme and the introduction of databases have removed duplicate and deceased card holders. These improved internal management structures within the health boards in identifying those eligible for medical cards have changed the figures. The introduction of the co-op scheme with general practitioners providing 24 hour direct access to a doctor has also made a difference. Further work is needed to alleviate the difficulty of people going directly to accident and emergency departments rather than their GP for minor medical issues. This has created a bottleneck at one end while at the other, sufficient step-down facilities are not available to free up acute beds. With the implementation of the reform programmes adopted by the Government, more people opting for co-op GPs and step-down facilities, the freeing up of acute beds will increase. The Government has responded to the need for reform with increased staffing for general practitioners — for example, nurses, whether asthma specialists or general GP nurses, can now work in GP surgeries. Given our multicultural society, GPs are being offered training to deal with non-EU nationals and language difficulties. Funding has been put in place by this Government in that regard.I have no doubt the Government is committed to extending medical card coverage, as set out in the health strategy, to increase the number of persons on low incomes eligible for medical cards and to give priority to families with children, in particular children with a disability. While this commitment may not have been met to date, this Government will be judged on what it delivers over a five year timeframe. History has proven that if we continue to pump money into the health service without addressing the management deficiencies in that service, we are throwing money at a system which will not deliver the standard of health care we want.The health boards and their chief executive officers have addressed the new guidelines laid down for the extension of medical card facilities for those returning to full employment. That was a welcome development in that people were not dissuaded from entering the workforce on the grounds that they would lose their right to a medical card. These are welcome measures which are necessary in order to move people away from becoming dependent on a social welfare system and to encourage them to go back into the workforce.I support the Government's amendment. We have a health service that is moving in the right direction and we now have a Minister who will continue the reform programmes this Government has set out. When the Government completes its term of office, it will be seen to have made a major difference to the health service delivered to all citizens.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, and look forward to seeing a lot of him in the House because I have found him a good person to work with.I find the amendment to this motion very depressing because while we all know there has been terrific economic growth in this country over the past ten years and that there has been a huge investment in the health service, the paper published by the Economic and Social Research Institute yesterday entitled Ireland's Health Care System: Some Issues and Challenges, by Anne Nolan and Brian Nolan, made the most profoundly depressing reading. Having spent €20 of my own good money on it, I will give Senators some of the benefit of what they said in their conclusions. They looked at Ireland and the basic outcome of our health service, including the life expectancy of men and women, infant mortality rates, low birth weights and so on. The only country worse than Ireland is the United States and I hope the Government takes this into account when considering the fact that investment in financial terms is not the only thing that matters with the health service. The paper states:Some of the difficulties in such a benchmarking exercise were seen when we [looked] at a key indicator, namely the level of health spending. This has risen very rapidly indeed in nominal terms in recent years, outpacing even the exceptional scale of economic growth. However, in purchasing power terms and as a percentage of GNP it was only at the UK level — which the British government considers too low compared with other EU countries — by 2002. Re-classification of some spending by the Department of Health by the OECD in 2003 also significantly reduced their estimate of Ireland's health spending, a process which may not be applied uniformly across countries.In other words, some expenditure which we put under the health heading was included by other countries under social services.The report further states:With primary care a central focus of official strategies we then investigated the use of general practitioner services by people at different income levels, in particular those with and without entitlement to free GP care. Having controlled for other characteristics, including health status, those with medical card cover were found to have on average about 1.6 more visits each year than those with similar characteristics but without a medical card. Even if the health status indicators available to us understate the difference in needs between those with and without medical cards, it seems likely that the different financial incentives they face also play a role in producing this very substantial gap. The current substantial charges facing Irish patients without medical cards in all probability discourage some "necessary" as well as "unnecessary" GP visits, and this would also apply to introducing charges for medical card patients, essentially because of the uncertainty about drawing this distinction — particularly for the layman in deciding whether to visit.I can tell Senators that is the way it is. As several Senators have said, we have a situation where those who are just above the limit are put off going to see their doctor, which can be most counterproductive at a later stage when they end up in accident and emergency or are admitted to hospital.The difference in visiting rates have been alluded to. Table 6 on page 79 of the above mentioned paper is very useful because it compares visiting rates per percentile income of people in the various OECD countries from the lowest ten percentile to the top ten percentile. We differ in one dreadful aspect, that is, in the third percentile — I am sure most people would probably reckon it is a pretty low income — we drop off from 6.6 visits to the doctor per adult to 3.6. That does not occur in respect of any other country. There is a serious problem for patients at that income level which must be addressed. I do not care what we have put into the health service — it is a huge amount of money — but there is a target group of people who are probably at the butt of the discrimination in the health service.One finding which cheered me up, from the point of view of general practitioners, was that there was no difference in visiting rates to doctors, whether they were paid a fee per item or capitation. That was cheering. At least the medical profession is not encouraging people to go to their GPs.We are also running into trouble where people manage to get the money together to go to their GPs but do not have the money to buy the drugs they need. There is price-fixing in every country in Europe, and Ireland is one of the highest. The prices for drugs are fixed between the pharmaceutical industry and the Government. Is the price being fixed particularly high in this country because of the extent of employment the pharmaceutical provides? We really need to look at that issue and I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, will do that. A doctor telephoned me today to say that a patient of his with respiratory disease could not buy her inhaler, that she had lost her medical card and that she ended up in Beaumont Hospital. That is counterproductive.Even in areas such as chiropody — I declare an interest because I am the president of the Diabetes Federation of Ireland — chiropodists' payments have been index linked since 1979. They now get €18.87 per visit but the cost of dressings and so forth have gone up enormously in the interim. They reckon they need €35 per visit, so those who will take medical card patients are asking them to pay €10 towards their treatment. Many of these people cannot afford the €10, so they do not visit the chiropodist and present in the diabetic clinic when they have ulcers on their feet and are admitted on average for a month. Can anyone tell me the rationale behind that?I read in the newspapers the other day that in Ballymun, there is considered to be an excessive use of anti-depressants and that people there are on them for far too long. Ballymun was one of the primary care pilot centres.This is a very good idea. Members must have seen in newspapers the antiquated Ballymun health centre that has been closed on occasion because of a danger from electrical faults. It also had to be closed last winter because there was no heating. That is bad but what is infuriating is that there is a state-of-the-art medical centre across the road which has been idle for two years because of some kind of dispute between the Department of Health and Children and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Nobody can identify the problem. Can anyone explain the point of that?In addition, the centre was told it could recruit more staff, yet when it tried to do so it was told there was a ceiling on recruitment. Is that any way to run a health service with such fragmented decisions being made? We have to look at how things are on the ground, taking into account the improved economic situation and the fact that so much money is going into the health service.I cannot understand why some people cannot get medical cards immediately. The Post Polio Support Group made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member. Thank God we have not had an epidemic or any cases of polio since the early 1960s. A group of some 200 people suffer with post-polio syndrome. They have serious medical problems. Many of them have not been able to work for years and others who struggle to keep working are above the income threshold for entitlement to a medical card. They are dying off. Each year there is a decreased number of them, yet this small group of people cannot get medical cards. The over-70s got medical cards, which I welcomed but I said there were more deserving groups.The level of investment in the health service needs to be examined. I recognise what is being invested. I read the Brennan and Hanly reports. I have read about 100 reports commissioned in the time the previous Minister was in Hawkin's House which, incidentally, is a dreadful building. Unless we take a more targeted approach to dealing with problems in the health service we will still keep coming up with dreadful reports about the basic statistics. When I saw that our infant mortality rate was so bad I could have wept. I keep looking at infant mortality rates in reports like that of the UNFPA so I can boast about ours and I was very surprised we figured so badly in this one.I warmly welcome the Minister to the House and to her new position. I hope she will have great success in her job. I assure her that any criticism I may make of departmental policies is only done in an attempt to be constructive.

Particular areas need attention and, as other speakers have pointed out, we are all aware of the problems. We are not saying problems do not exist, they do. The widening of eligibility for medical cards is only one of the problems which needs to be addressed.The Government has spent more on health than any of its predecessors. Senator Minihan pointed out that ten years ago the health budget was in the region of €3 billion while today it is almost €10 billion. As he said, ten years ago one would have thought that if €10 billion were spent on the health service it would be a first class one.A significant and growing percentage of national wealth is spent on health. Many of the measures currently in train to improve the health service will come to fruition in the years to come. Opposition Members are meant to be bright people and they will appreciate that there is no quick fix——

Two ground-breaking developments introduced by the Government in recent times are the ban on smoking and the treatment purchase scheme, the latter being one of the most innovative initiatives ever implemented. I smile as I say that in the presence of the Minister, Deputy Harney, because we know from where it came. We are very proud of it and it has taken, and continues to take, many people off waiting lists.I would welcome a review of medical cards, including costs, to try to establish whether patients are getting the best value for the expenditure involved. We need to examine areas such as access, care, treatment and drugs. On taking up office recently, the Minister, Deputy Harney, pointed out that it is not merely a question of doctors' fees, the high cost of drugs is also a factor. Senator Henry alluded to this matter and I agree with her. Drugs are very expensive. If a review of medical cards is instigated, one could look at expanding the system. The Minister is courageous but she is also kind hearted in seeking its expansion.I will not dwell for too long on the ESRI report to which previous speakers referred. Of course we are all concerned when we read about the growing body of evidence that suggests people do not go to their GPs because they do not have a medical card. They are putting their health at risk. A new class of people are no longer going to the doctor. When my children were quite young, which was not today or yesterday, if one of them was sneezing and sniffling on a Monday I would try to push him in with his brother so both of them would be sniffling and sneezing on Tuesday or Wednesday and I could take two for the price of one to the doctor. At that time I had four children under four years of age. I am sure young mothers today are no different than I was 15 to 20 years ago. If a review were to take place, I believe savings would be possible on the whole scheme and those savings could be used to expand it.I would welcome the introduction of new ideas. What about the GMS operating in partnership with the VHI? The VHI could pick up part of the bill, or people could have a medical card for GP purposes only and would then pay their own drugs bills. Senator Browne claimed children under four should have medical cards. I would not broaden it that much. However, I would like to see large families with, for example, six children under six or four children under four where parents are strapped for cash——

There are still growing families. One need only look around here to see that.Senator Henry made a case for the post-polio group. I am sure such people do not like to be called victims. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children to which the Post Polio Support Group made a presentation in recent months. The members of the group are to be admired. They pointed out to us the growing cost of visits to a GP and the cost of drugs. Some 200 people are affected. These people are not young, they are all getting on and I would like to see them looked after.As Senator Minihan already said, the Government is committed to the health service and will continue to be committed. I have no doubt that with the Minister as head of the Department, she will drive this and will give us value for money. On other occasions when she has been in the House the impression she has given was that of a caring Minister, especially where people's lives were being affected. I wish her well in her new portfolio. As spokesperson on health she can always rest assured of my support in this Chamber.

However, I wish the Minister well.The specific purpose of the motion this evening was to deal with the issue of medical cards. I want to make a political point first which needs to be said. There is a notion abroad that the two parties in Government made a large number of promises before the last general election and have systematically broken them all since. That is not actually fair to the Government. The Government parties did not make many promises before the general election. They made relatively few that would catch the eye. This was one of perhaps two or three that was important and caught the eye, deceived people and persuaded them to vote for the Government. It was an important undertaking and promise on behalf of the Government parties. That in a sense emphasises the level of betrayal people feel and the hypocrisy in which the Government has engaged. It is regrettable.Speakers on the Government side such as Senator Minihan said they could not rush into this, being only seven years in Government. They could not be expected to deliver on such a promise which was given only two or three years ago. Others said so much money had been spent without any immediate results being expected. They need to look for value for money, reform of the system and so on. All of this is fair in itself, but does not address the net issue the House is discussing this evening, namely, medical cards.I want to talk about GP services in particular, and to some extent pharmaceuticals, and everything that follows from that. This is a net issue which can be disposed of with relative ease provided there is the political will to do it and to engage with the medical profession, GPs and their representative bodies to ensure we have a system that is capable of delivering.The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, told the Dáil only a few months ago that it would cost about €685 million to introduce a comprehensive GP system. The figure for extending medical cards to all those under 18 would be just €151 million. I do not mean this personally but when I listen to Members on the other side of the House such as Senator Feeney suggesting that the medical card might, perhaps, be extended to tiny cohorts such as children under four, I wonder at our lack of ambition in this country. It would cost €151 million to extend the medical card system to all those under 18. We are spending multiples of that on far more frivolous purposes. The wonderful SSIA scheme is costing €600 million a year. For a quarter of that cost the medical card could be extended to all those under 18.I am sure the Minister is well aware that there is a particular difficulty with children. These are the people, unfortunately, who are most likely to suffer owing to the lack of a comprehensive system. All of us have met mothers who have to make difficult choices between keeping the household moving in a particular week and bringing a child or children to the GP. It is an unfortunate fact that those who are least likely to be able to afford the €35 to €50 for a visit to a GP are the people most likely to need the service. They are young children and people in poorer households with lower incomes. These are the people most likely to need GP intervention because of malnourishment, poverty and its effects and, perhaps, unemployment. Unfortunately, these are the people who can least afford it.My party believes and argues passionately for a comprehensive GP system and free access to family doctors. Such a system is taken for granted in most western European countries. What is crucially important is that we can afford it. All that is required is agreement from the general practitioners in order to introduce the system. I do not underestimate this. I imagine the Government will extend eligibility over the next few months. It will be looking at a number of different ways to do it. It could be extended on an income basis by, for example, widening the threshold for means tests. It could be done on the basis of infirmity involving people with particular illnesses who must see a doctor on a regular basis. It could also be achieved by targeting a particular age cohort.If the aim is to end up with a system in five or ten years where everybody has access, then I do not suppose it matters which particular half-way house is used. I would favour doing away with the means test in favour of an age cohort of those under 18. However, that should be done only if the intention is to end up with a comprehensive system that facilitates everybody. If it is not, then a more complex mix is needed. We need to ensure in the first instance that people who visit the doctor on a regular basis are not prevented from doing so. We must also ensure that people on low incomes are not prevented from going to the doctor by virtue of that fact. A more complex reaction is needed, therefore, if the Government intends to do it on a bit by bit basis.I know, however, that the Minister is one for big ideas and likes to take large strides. I would urge her to look at the possibility of a comprehensive arrangement and deal with the doctors on the basis of a per capita system, a per item mechanism or some combination of the two. Frankly, I do not care but whatever system we put in place should facilitate people through its ease of access.I want to mention the primary care strategy. All of us are persuaded that this is the way forward and that investment in primary care is essential not just for itself, but because it takes the emphasis off secondary care, which is far too common in this country. We depend far too much on secondary care intervention at far too early a stage. All of us are persuaded of this fact.The previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was quite persuasive in his convictions and the manner in which he put forward the case. I have heard the current Minister refer to this briefly over the past couple of weeks. It is essential we do not lose track of this. Much of this is not sexy, but it is of major importance. There are only ten primary care teams in the country, despite all the trumpeting three years ago. They are acknowledged to be generally successful where they have been introduced, but ten teams after three years is a pitiful result. We need to be moving forward. I believe general practitioners are more open to these radical moves than they might have been ten or 15 years ago. We know that members of the medical profession, GPs included, wanted for many years to ensure that their private patient base was effectively protected and resisted so-called socialised medicine because of that concern. The profession is changing, not least because there are now far more women doctors who want a life and who are quite happy to work eight or ten hours a day.I am also conscious of the fact that there are many women, and indeed men, in the medical profession who are anxious to change the way GPs work and do not want to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They want to have a life and to do a decent job. They are more than anxious to get into serious negotiations with the Minister and her Department. I hope she is also anxious to do so. If so, she will have support from this side of the House.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I would like to thank those Members of the House who have spoken for their good wishes. I want to assure them I am no messiah. If Senator Henry was in the House I would pass on a letter to her I received last week from somebody wishing me well, and acknowledging that I was a consultant and expert in health care. The person was sure I had all the answers and clearly believed Senator Henry was the new Minister for Health and Children. The writer of the letter thought Senator Henry and I were one and the same person.In An Agreed Programme for Government which covers the five-year term, 2002-07, the two coalition parties agreed to extend eligibility for medical cards. I assure the House this commitment will be met. We intend to give priority to persons on low incomes, families with children and particularly to children with a disability.Extension of medical card eligibility, allied with reforms to achieve better value for money, is one of the priorities I have set since being appointed Minister for Health and Children. We recognise and acknowledge that income eligibility limits are low — too low in too many cases. The issue, therefore, is not one of principle but of how and in what manner to best achieve extension of the medical card entitlement in a way that devotes scarce public resources to those who need them most.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The Government is currently working on Estimates for all Departments in preparation for approval and publication of the Book of Estimates later this autumn. The goal of extending medical card eligibility is a very high priority for me in the context of those Estimates.The motion before the House offers an opportunity to set out certain aspects of how the GMS scheme currently works. There has been much concern about social welfare recipients losing out on medical cards because of the increases in social welfare rates in recent years. The Department of Health and Children has advised all health board chief executives that medical card holders should not lose their medical cards because they have received increases in social welfare rates announced in recent budgets. In addition, the CEOs have been asked to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that the increases in social welfare payments would not disadvantage them in any way when applying to retain their medical cards.As a matter of course, the medical card income guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The last such increase was notified in January 2004. Health board chief executive officers have discretion in respect of the issuing of medical cards and also the discretion to take into account a range of income sources that are currently excluded by health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite someone having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other special circumstances would justify it.Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payments scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.Since July 2001, all persons over the age of 70 have a statutory entitlement to a medical card. Some people have criticised that decision and I acknowledge the points made by the Brennan commission and others on value for money and its implementation. However, I do not hear many people or party spokespersons committing themselves to reversing the decision.The health strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and simplify the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which include, among other things, streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card application process to ensure greater fairness and transparency; providing clear information on how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services available.I am committed to the preparation of new legislation which will update and codify the legal framework for eligibility and entitlements to health services. Between 1997 and 2003, overall payments made under the GMS scheme have increased from €303 million to €938 million in that six year period. Much of that additional investment was required to address the increasing drugs cost and demand. Also during that time, the number of general practitioners with GMS scheme contracts increased from 1,641 to 2,181.In this period of office the Government introduced measures to provide medical card coverage for citizens over 70 years of age. Initially, this was on a phased basis in 1999 and 2000 and in 2001 eligibility for medical cards was provided to all people aged 70 or over. The people in this age group are among those in greatest need of health care services. By providing medical cards it allows our older citizens to attend their general practitioner when needed without concern.Currently, 1.15 million people have medical cards. That figure is lower when compared to figures for other years. It can largely be expected, however, as a result of a number of factors including more people having jobs and more people earning higher incomes. These are positive results for the individuals concerned and for our society.These factors, however, may also mean that some people are no longer eligible for a medical card on purely income grounds. I point out that this effect is offset to some degree by the policy of the retention of medical cards for people moving into employment. I am happy to acknowledge that this measure was introduced by the rainbow Government in 1996 and has been maintained by this and the previous Government.The purpose is to remove disincentives for long-term unemployed persons taking up jobs. It means, in effect, that persons on the live register for at least one year, otherwise known as long-term unemployed, who take up insurable employment are deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. This provision also covers participants on approved schemes such as the back to work allowance, community employment, Jobstart, jobs initiative, partnership and group initiatives and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities schemes.The ongoing management and review of the medical card databases has been a factor also in the reduced numbers who hold medical cards. This verification exercise by health boards, which took place in 2003, resulted in the removal of approximately 104,000 cards. Most of these cards would have been considered by health boards to be normal deletions due to death, change in eligibility status or persons moving from one board area to another. A certain proportion were removed due to being duplicates or expired records for people aged 70.I underline again that our commitment to extend medical card eligibility is one that will be met. By contrast, it has not been part of the strategy for the general medical service under this or previous Governments to achieve medical card coverage for a set proportion of the population as a whole. It is to allocate resources to people based on need — in other words, we will not pick a fixed number to extend them but rather deal with income thresholds and real hardship cases as much as possible.In this regard, I need hardly add that a policy to implement 100% coverage of the population with medical cards, that is, free GP care for all, is neither socially nor economically equitable. There are not many people who believe that a reform priority for our health services should be that people who are well off, in good jobs, own businesses and have massive wealth should have access to their GP, drugs and dental care met by the rest of society. That is not the route to social equity or the efficient use of public resources.Primary care in general practice is and will continue to be a key part of our health services. For that reason the Government has increased funding for GP co-operatives. From 1999 to 2003, a total of €46.5 million was invested by the Government in the development of general practitioner led out of hours co-operatives. In 2004, a further €26 million has been provided. Out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services to their patients while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, weekends or bank holidays. There are out of hours co-operatives in all health board areas — unfortunately, too few of them.The reform of primary health care has a major role to play in alleviating many of the difficulties that end up in the accident and emergency service or the hospital system. Senator McDowell acknowledged that and I agree with him. We do not solve one problem in the health services without creating others; it is part of a jigsaw. Primary health care and its reform to a modern set of circumstances, as the Senator said in respect of people's working conditions, is a central part of the reform of the health strategy that has been embraced by the Government.This debate centred on medical cards. The debate in the other House was somewhat broader; I understand it dealt with 80 different items. This is the first opportunity I have had since taking over the Department of Health and Children to say that health care and its reform is a major priority for the Government. Nobody wants to live in a society which does not have a health service that is responsive to people on the basis of medical need and no other basis. Notwithstanding the great injection of public funds into health services, a threefold increase since 1997, we have major challenges ahead if we are to create a system that is fair and responsive to the needs of patients. Above all else, patients must be put first. There are 120,000 people working in the delivery of health care, of whom 97,000 work directly for the Department or the health boards; the balance work for voluntary organisations and other bodies delivering health care. It is a considerable number of people and they do not come cheap. Next year, to meet the salary bill of those who work in the health services will cost €500 million, over and above the almost €10 billion that we spend this year. We must make sure that we operate the health services to the best possible standards, that we have modern work practices in every respect. The manner in which we operated in the past is no longer relevant to an area that is changing very rapidly. We must ensure that our practices are flexible enough to deal with real situations as they arise.This afternoon I had the opportunity to meet with the chief executive officers of the six Dublin hospitals and the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and his deputy. We want to work together and be focused on solving in the immediate future the accident and emergency difficulties that confront the acute hospitals in Dublin. Solving one problem, however, creates others, and in particular there are many people in acute hospitals who should be in different facilities. They do not require to be in the acute hospital services. In the Dublin area alone there are over 300 people in beds who would be more appropriately placed in step-down or other facilities. We must work on different levels to provide solutions if we are to have a health service that can respond within a reasonable timeframe to the expectations of our citizens not just in accident and emergency, but for other services too.I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I look forward to returning to the House on the health care professionals Bill which will shortly be initiated here, at the request of the Leader of the House. I look forward to returning to the House over the next two and a half years to deal with many aspects of the health services.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I too welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and congratulate her on her appointment to that Department. She is a brave person to take on a troublesome area, a Department famously described by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, as "the Angola" of Departments. There is a great deal of work to be done in this area. In 2002 the coalition parties gave a clear commitment, at a time of unprecedented economic growth, to extend the medical card scheme to 200,000 people. Many people were lured to the polling stations and voted for the Government parties on that basis. In the two years since, we have not seen delivery of that commitment. Many commitments were made in various areas but none was more critical than this area which deals with a vulnerable section of society that is less well off than most. It is an undeniable fact that many people are forgoing the cost of visiting a doctor because they do not have the means to pay. That leads to the situation in which more and more people are presenting themselves at accident and emergency and are more distressed and in a worse medical condition than they would normally be.When the Tánaiste took up this position she said that figures revealed the cost of extending the GMS to 100,000 people is approximately €150 million. Our spokesperson, Deputy McManus, has done a great deal of work in this area and following her research maintains that the same amount of money would cover approximately 200,000 medical cards. I call on the Tánaiste and the Government to end the litany of promises made in this area and to extend the income eligibility for people to qualify for medical cards.One Minister described the extension of the scheme to 200,000 people as "extraordinarily expensive". I presume many of these policy areas were costed at the time of the election. If it was not "extraordinarily expensive" in 2002 how can it be so in 2004? To make the commitment in the first instance someone, somewhere must have costed that proposal. I do not accept the proposal from the Tánaiste or anybody else that it would be "extraordinarily expensive". It is a good investment and it would be money very well spent. No one in Government could deny that. Surely there is enough money in the budget surplus of €2.3 billion to cover the cost of extending the income eligibility to those to whom it was promised.We must impress upon the Tánaiste that it is money well-spent and if we do not spend the required amount of money in this area there will be an unnecessarily high demand on the resources at accident and emergency as people will present themselves there if they decide not to attend GPs because of the prices some charge. To someone on a social welfare payment of €140 a week, €40 or €50 is a lot of money. Few Members of this House could live on those rates of payment. It is also an indisputable fact that there are 100,000 fewer people in receipt of medical cards now than there were in January 1997 when the rainbow Government was in power. There is something seriously wrong if more people received medical cards when the country was less well off. We have had the Celtic tiger and unprecedented economic growth yet fewer people are receiving medical cards. The medical card qualification is the lowest since the GMS was introduced 32 years ago. That alone should be a wake-up call to the Government.The figures prove that the promise to extend the scheme was a sham. The Tánaiste said on her appointment as Minister for Health and Children that she does not have a political ideology but she does have political practicality. The practical experience of any Member of either House should be that there is a section of society which is less well off than most, which is vulnerable and is being directly affected by the Government's decision not to extend the GMS. That is shameful. I hope that while the Tánaiste occupies the Department of Health and Children there will be a change in this policy, that we will see real action in this area and an end to the litany of false promises, and that the Government will stop taking advantage of the most vulnerable people in society.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I too welcome the Minister to the House and add my congratulations to her on taking over this portfolio. I have great confidence that she will bring the same energy and success to that as she has brought to other jobs in Government. I was cheered by her response to, and concern for, the very real problem of people caught in the poverty trap on the threshold of the medical card eligibility.Senator Henry quoted from the ESRI report on health status. I take that with a grain of salt because health status is influenced by more elements than health care. The dominant factors are genetics, environment and lifestyle. Health care accounts for approximately 20% of that. These are matters over which the Minister and the Government have only indirect influence and it is unfair to pillory the Minister for this. One figure however, did bring me up short, namely, that at a certain point of moving out of eligibility, utilisation of the GP service has dropped by half. This suggests that those who most need the service and are most dependent on it are forced to give it up or forced to make enormously difficult choices about depriving their children of health care or finding some other means to balance the family budget. This aspect needs to be addressed.Part of the problem is that the rate of health care inflation is higher than the rate of inflation in the general economy. To increase health budgets in line with general inflation is normally not enough. People are caught in the trap whereby because they are earning a few more euro per week they are suddenly faced with enormous health bills. We need to find a way to cushion that.Apart from that I agree with a great deal of what Senator McDowell said. The concentration needs to be on how we run primary care. People often jump up and down about bricks and mortar in hospitals. However, a well-developed primary health care system would help us to deal with many of the problems now presenting in hospitals. I would prefer to have a free system and recover the money through taxation or some other means.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	358	That might be like asking the Minister to climb the north face of the Eiger in the current political climate. Primary health care contains the core of the answer to the problems. Without going the whole hog of a totally free system, Senator McDowell made some other suggestions. I believe the new generation of doctors, particularly female doctors, would welcome a different form of contract or organisation. Strong arguments exist for extending the co-operative system, particularly the after-hours system, which is very successful where I live in Northern Ireland and is staffed by young doctors. Equally much is to be said for ensuring that children have care in the same way and a great deal of weight could be taken off accident and emergency departments by having minor injuries units staffed by nurse practitioners as well as by such doctors. Changes are taking place in the boundaries between professions and roles and we should be prepared to take advantage of these changes.Since the cost of drugs is so penal, not only on the health service but also on those who have to buy their drugs when they lose eligibility, a case may be made for more insistence on generic prescribing. It is worth looking at the organisation of the health service to determine why it costs so much in terms of input to produce a relatively small output. The machine has an enormous capacity for consuming resources and just keeping itself going. We used to argue that for every £5 of input, we were lucky to get £1 of improved output.I refer to a matter to which Senators Henry and Feeney adverted, namely, the case of a small number of survivors of the polio epidemic in the 1950s. They are now aged and some are frail. They have very heavy medical costs and generally do not have medical card eligibility. I was present at the Oireachtas joint committee on the day they appeared before it. The Secretary General of the Department was questioned and was to come back to explain why they could not get these cards. I would like the Tánaiste to make that a matter of personal interest, as it could do an enormous amount of good for a very small expenditure.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wish the Tánaiste well in her new role as Minister for Health and Children. She faces a very difficult task. In light of what has gone on in recent years, the confidence of the general public and the health boards in the health system, while not at an all-time low, is very low. Without playing politics, the Opposition hopes that something can be done to instil a new confidence and that health will not be such a serious issue when we meet people on the doorsteps or in clinics.Politicians should not have to involve themselves in such cases. Health care professionals and managers are paid enormous amounts of money and it is sad when people find the health system has let them down despite the billions that have been invested. They have to come to my constituency office to ask me to make representations regarding medical cards or waiting lists, which is wrong. As politicians, the sooner we can divorce ourselves from this system the better. Unfortunately, the health system is the way it is.I have always found the Tánaiste very honest in her approach. While I have not always agreed with her, I have always found her to be very honest and pragmatic. She tells it as it is and I respect that in a Minister. However, she will find it very difficult to measure up to the promises made in 2002. As politicians we should not make rash promises. A rash promise was made to increase the number of medical card holders by 200,000. I know people have mentioned this again. It is quite obvious that the number of medical card holders has reduced by 46,000. This is driving constituents crazy because they simply do not have medical cover.The income ceiling for eligibility for medical cards has increased by a mere 8% since May 2002. While we welcome the 46% increase in the drugs refund scheme, unfortunately, charges for accident and emergency treatment have increased by 42% and the nightly cost for a public bed has increased by 36%. I am single, I get a nice salary as a Senator and would not consider myself to be on the breadline. While I regard myself as being quite measured and am not a devil may care person, I would put off a visit to a doctor if I had a cold as it costs €30 to €45. There is also the increased costs for prescription drugs. Sometimes it can cost up to €80. If I were a father with two or three children earning just over the ceiling for medical card eligibility, I would end up putting my children at risk as some people do because they cannot afford doctors' fees. This situation is seriously wrong.The percentage of the population covered by the scheme has fallen from 31.24% in January 2002 to 29.43% in January 2004. It has been mentioned that the CEOs of the health boards have discretion in allocating medical cards in cases of hardship and medical need. Their discretion is limited by the budget of the health board for which they work. The CEOs of health boards often act as if they own the health boards. Although I have never served on a health board, I do not doubt that officials in the health system are sometimes almost as powerful as those who are elected to represent the various constituencies. When politicians make representations to CEOs — those who make the decisions — they may be told that funding is or is not available. If one has served on a health board and one's relationship with the CEO is okay — if one knows him well — one will get a much more favourable audience than that given to others, such as Senators and Deputies from Opposition parties and county councillors.Allowing the relevant Minister to have a say is also part of the system. Politicians should be divorced from the health system but — this is where the contradiction comes in — the system is run by politicians, unfortunately. It is operated by people who have not delivered and are primarily interested in covering their own jobs. I wonder if the changes in the health board structures will help to change the current jobs for the boys system. That is another day's work, however.Children under the age of four should receive medical cards automatically. I do not think there should be a limit on funds in such cases. Similarly, cancer patients should receive medical cards as a matter of course. Some cancer patients who have called to my office have told me about their fight to get a medical card. A person who is going to hospital for cancer treatment, such as radiation, should receive a medical card automatically. Given that most cancer patients go through a traumatic time, the Government and the health boards should ensure they are given medical cards.We are all in it together. This is a serious situation. I wish the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, well in trying to get through the morass she faces. Any success she will have in her new Department, which has been referred to as Angola, will be a fair achievement.

Similarly, we are glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is back in the House.

The motion proposed by the Labour Party Senators is extremely focused and all the better for it. The Tánaiste said earlier that she is preparing to speak in the Dáil this evening on a motion which has 80 separate elements. I do not doubt that the motion before the House at present is quite focused on the provision of medical cards.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	363	In her speech, the Tánaiste reiterated the comments she has made on radio and in various interviews with media commentators. She spoke clearly about the provision of medical cards, particularly for those on the margins. I refer to those who are deemed to be ineligible for medical cards because they exceed the limits by €5 or €10, rather than those on the margins of society, who are clearly eligible for medical cards.Senator Feighan said earlier that he does not think politicians should be involved in making the case for people in need of health care. He is hoping for a kind of never-never land if he thinks it will ever happen that politicians will not have such a role. I am sure the Cathaoirleach, the Minister for Health and Children and the two Ministers of State at her Department who have been to the House this evening will agree that health is the area of care about which politicians are most often asked during constituency clinics. I encounter three or four such cases each weekend.We all know it costs between €35 and €45 to visit a doctor, before one has to find the money for the cost of a prescription. Many parents, especially mothers, who try to balance their domestic budgets for the week find that they cannot afford to pay for the visit to the doctor or the prescription costs for one of their children. Children have many needs during the first few years of their lives. Parents may have to call a doctor for ailments which may seem insignificant in retrospect, but which are highly important to them at the time. One cannot remove the element of care or urgency in the minds of parents when they are addressing such issues.I have great faith in the Tánaiste's ability to fulfil the commitment she gave this evening to extending medical card eligibility. I strongly urge her to fulfil it, although I appreciate that she cannot do so overnight. She was quite right to refer to improvements in the number of people in employment and the increases in salaries and wages. I continue to have concerns about parents of young families and people who are deemed ineligible for medical cards for the sake of a small amount of money. Such cases are very difficult. Other Senators have said that politicians' constituency duties should not be related to the health sphere of activity. I do not agree that public representatives should be removed from all such spheres of activity, however. What is the point of politics if one cannot take up particular cases?I wish to discuss the so-called discretion of the CEOs of the health boards. When I first became involved in this area, the CEOs used to have great discretion. If a particular person's application for a medical card was rejected, one could submit an appeal on his or her behalf to the relevant CEO. The CEOs I encountered, most of whom were men, supposedly reviewed the case. In years gone by, there seemed to be a much greater level of acceptance of the need for such exceptions. The appeals one made were normally accepted if a fair case was made. In recent times, however, the parameters of the eligibility criteria seem to be rigidly adhered to in the cases I encounter. The guidelines are not as flexible as I think they should be and, indeed, as the original scheme envisaged they should be. I am certain that the room for flexibility and discretion has lessened extraordinarily.The CEO of a health board is only as good as the money available to the board for disbursement. I would like the appeals system in health boards to be restored to its former vigour and weight. I am sure the Minister of State understands these matters well because he has come across many cases in his professional role. Politicians do not live in isolation — they have to stay in touch with the real world. Is the Cathaoirleach anxious to say something to me?

I knew by his face that the Cathaoirleach was getting anxious.The new team in the Department of Health and Children, led by the Tánaiste, will ensure that the pleas from the Dáil and the Seanad will find a resonance within the Department as the Tánaiste is engaging in deliberations.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I welcome many aspects of the debate. It appears that everybody agrees there is something wrong with our primary health care system. I do not think I heard a single instance of dissent from that view. The trouble is that we knew, because it is well documented, that a good primary health care system is the essential prerequisite for a good hospital care system and a good health care system for elderly people and children. Everyone knew that seven years ago and yet we have been in the extraordinary position that the Government decided to spend a vast sum on the health services. After having done so, it produced a health strategy. It had been in office for almost five years before it did so. What it was really saying was that it had spent a great deal without knowing what it was doing; it worked out the strategy afterwards.It would not have taken much serious reflection to see that two things would happen, the first being that eligibility for medical cards would drop proportionately as prosperity increased. This country was prosperous before the coalition came to power. It inherited a prosperous country and its job should have been to manage it. Instead, it has spent more time pretending that it created something that it inherited and that others are the cause of the problems it did not solve. In both cases, its energy could have been better devoted to confronting the fundamental fact that primary health care is the bedrock of a good health care system.It was inevitable in a period of spectacular and welcome increases in prosperity that eligibility issues would arise. It is the most extraordinarily belated conversion to hear everyone on that side of the House tell us that there is a problem with eligibility and affordability. It is not often that I defend them, but we have at least begun to move away from blaming the GPs for this problem. In a piece that I wrote recently, I pointed out that if I go to see my GP, it costs me €45. I wanted to get my electric cooker fixed and the company said that it would cost me €100 to get the person inside the house.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	370	That is just a cooker.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	371	That is a cooker. That is about 60% more than the GP would have cost. I have had the great benefit of not having to have a GP visit the house in many years, since the children were small. I presume that it is now about €60 for a house visit. That is still 40% less than they were going to charge me to have someone stand inside the door to look at my cooker. Let us not blame the GPs for everything. We made a political decision. The Government decided the resource allocation for the health services and that medical card eligibility was down at the bottom of its priorities. In terms of humanity, it was a profoundly wrong decision, but, more importantly, on the level of efficient delivery of cost effective health care for our people, it was a profoundly bad one.Senator McDowell spoke about a universal system of primary care free at point of use. Far from being cloud cuckoo land, it is the reality of life for people in most of the civilised countries of Europe. In Sweden, Norway, Finland and such countries, people have access to a primary health care system which is effectively free. Let us not hear that nonsense about how it would distort or overburden our economy. This year's world growth competitiveness index shows us slipping down the list for every factor. Going up the list are the civilised countries of Europe that have recognised something the Government has consistently failed to see, that economic prosperity is a means to an end — to provide a good society. The failure of the Government on this issue, as on many others, has been the failure to use prosperity to do what people wanted it to do.

I welcome the Minister to the Seanad and congratulate her on her promotion.I would like to share my time with Senator Ulick Burke. I want to raise the issue of the amalgamation of St. Patrick's College and St. Jarlath's College in Tuam, the latter school being my own alma mater. The boards of management of both schools have been in contact with me about what they feel is the lack of progress in this proposed amalgamation, which was announced seven years ago. The progress has been slow. Both schools have worked hard to pave the way for the realisation of the project. They would like the necessary planning and development of the proposal to proceed as quickly as possible. However, the situation has presented difficulties for the two schools, particularly in regard to long-term planning, maintenance and staffing levels. It is urgent that the project should be completed as quickly as possible. To that end, the boards of management and principals of the two schools have invited public representatives in the constituency of Galway East to a meeting next Friday week.The buildings at St. Patrick's College are very poor. It would like an answer as to what is happening and the meeting to which I referred is being held at the college to highlight its poor facilities. St. Jarlath's College has been a boarding school for many years. Two years ago, it stopped taking in boarders and, as a result, numbers have reduced. It also finds it difficult to plan for the amalgamation, which was announced seven years ago. It is time to put in place the planning and design for the project. I understand St. Jarlath's will be the base for the project as it has adequate land for the necessary buildings. However, no progress is being made at present and I raise the issue to try to obtain further information on the proposed amalgamation.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I welcome the Minister and thank Senator Kitt for sharing his time with me. I endorse Senator Kitt's point. When two schools decide to amalgamate on an agreed basis, this should not be neglected but endorsed and moved along as quickly as possible, as should be the case in Tuam. This is a time of great change for the staff, boards of management and trustees of both colleges. It is, therefore, important the Minister moves the project forward so that progress can take place in an atmosphere of mutual respect and agreement.All too often, the idea of amalgamation has caused great dissension and division between staffs. When a proposal is agreed by the boards of management and all involved, they should be enabled to work together. These staff will have to complete their working lives together and, as Senator Kitt stated, it is important we move quickly to achieve a resolution and that a timeframe is given so there will be no opportunity for some to begin complaining, which would lead to further disruption. If the project is delayed for too long, perhaps some other plans will be put in place which would jeopardise the concept of amalgamation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your welcome and kind comments. I also thank Senator Kitt for raising this issue, one of the schools being his alma mater, and Senator Ulick Burke for his comments. Senator Burke is correct that significant change is involved in regard to education structure, demographics and needs among trustees of the schools, which is not only significant for the education service but very emotional for those involved. It is important that this be dealt with sympathetically.There are five post-primary schools in Tuam — two voluntary secondary boys' schools, two voluntary secondary girls' schools and the vocational school which is co-educational. In late 2000, the four voluntary second level schools in Tuam agreed a rationalisation programme. Agreement was reached with the relevant trustees to form a single boys' and a single girls' school, each to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 700 pupils. The vocational school is not part of that move. The school planning section of my Department agreed with the management authorities of both schools involved in the amalgamation of the boys' school that the optimum plan to address the accommodation needs of the single school which will result from the amalgamation is to extend facilities at St. Jarlath's College and to refurbish the existing facilities. The objective is to ensure that facilities at the new school will serve the needs of the school community well into the future.Obviously, given the comments of Senator Kitt, the school and community want to know when this plan will be implemented. While I cannot be specific, we recognise in our building programme the importance of amalgamation and all it involves. I intend to publish the multi-annual school building programme before the end of the year and this will provide clarity, including in regard to the planned project at St Jarlath's College.As it is an amalgamation and because of the co-operation of all involved, the project carries a high priority rating of band 1.4. This rating and the background of the schools will have a positive influence on the timescale for delivery of the project, which I hope will be evident when the plan is published at the end of the year. My officials have been in contact with the school authorities to progress the detailed preliminary work necessary to facilitate this large-scale building project. I hope we can continue in the programme to determine in an open and transparent way how projects are included for funding. We also want to be fair to everybody while recognising all that is involved in amalgamations.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, on her appointment and wish her every success in the job. I raise the issue of Clonlara national school at which Senator Dooley and I attended a meeting on Thursday last of up to 400 parents and the chairman of the board of management. There is widespread concern with the delay. Some indication was apparently given that the school project would begin last year but that work did not commence and there is fear that it will be put off again this year. The project is at the architectural planning stage. At present over 300 students attend the school and many have classes in the PE hall which is not suitable.I will not labour the point as I am sure the Minister is already fully aware of the situation. However, I want the school included in the budget for this year and want a beginning to the work. Clonlara is a rapidly expanding area with a large population. The area has many children but the school relies on prefabs and a PE hall for classes. I ask the Minister to use what influence she has to draw the attention of the executors of her office to the urgency of the situation so that action might be taken this year.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I thank Senator Daly for sharing his time with me and for showing interest in this project. It is in the east of the county, where I am the only Oireachtas Member. I thank Senator Daly for his attendance at the meeting last week and for his assistance in this regard. I wish to be associated with the congratulations to the Minister. It is great to see her in the House as Minister for Education and Science. She has been with us several times and has shown great respect to the Seanad, for which we are thankful.As Senator Daly outlined, there is a difficulty with Clonlara national school, particularly in regard to the extension and the fact that a number of classes are being taught in the PE hall, where conditions are cramped, there is no natural light and the situation is unsuitable from a health and safety perspective. Issues arise regarding storage areas and the fact that teachers must disrupt classes to get sports equipment for external play areas. However, the school does a good job in difficult circumstances and tribute should be paid to the principal, Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick, for his work.Another health and safety issue concerns the boiler. However, the school authorities are slow to replace it because when the extension is built a larger boiler will be needed and will form part of the overall work. Effectively, the sooner they can go ahead with the extension the sooner they can overcome all the problems that exist. I again thank the Minister and hope she will look with favour on this school when making announcements regarding schools building projects.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I thank Senators Daly and Dooley for raising this issue and for their kind comments. Scoil Seanain Naofa, Clonlara, County Clare, has an enrolment of 301 pupils so I am delighted to hear there were 400 parents at the meeting. It shows a true commitment on the part of families. The school has a staffing level of a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers, one learning support teacher and one resource teacher. Clearly it is a substantial school and the Senator has indicated that the projections are there for the long term as well.A full design team has been appointed and architectural planning has commenced for a refurbishment and extension project for the school. The project is listed in section 8 of the 2004 schools building programme. Senators will be aware of the various levels through which a project must go before going to final tender. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department. The project is at stage 3 of architectural planning and officials in my Department are currently examining the documentation.However, I would be very concerned if, as indicated by Senator Dooley, there are fumes emanating from the boiler. I would be concerned in the context of the responsibility of the board of management to ensure the health and safety of the children in its care. Emergency funding is available if needed. Funding is also available under the summer works scheme specifically for such a contingency. I would advise that the board of management should not allow a situation to develop where the children and staff are in any danger from the boiler while awaiting a more permanent building.All of the projects are being reviewed at the moment, particularly this one, to see how they can be included as part of a multi-annual schools building programme from 2005. My current priority is with the Estimates process with the Minister for Finance where I am trying to get as much money as possible for this important issue. Once I know how much money there will be, I will be in a better position to advise on what will happen regarding this school.

As recently as 21 May last I spoke on the issue and was responded to by the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, who was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the time. I was pleased when on 3 December 2003 the Minister announced in the budget that Newcastle West was part of a cluster of locations in the mid-west region which embraced Kilrush and Listowel. It was decided at the time that each location would receive approximately 50 positions.This demonstrated a responsible attitude to that location because there is a very successful Revenue base between Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh involving about 900 jobs which moved to the area between 1992 and 1996. The cluster effect is of great importance in these locations. It provides scope for promotional opportunities not alone at local level, but at regional level which would be an added attraction for people who decide to work in a decentralised project.While I am not certain of the figures for Kilrush and Listowel, I understand that Newcastle West has been over-subscribed in terms of initial interest. While quite a few applicants have applied from Dublin locations, many of the applicants working in Departments in city locations are from the west Limerick area and are delighted by the prospect of being transferred to Newcastle West near their home base. Furthermore, in his response on 21 May the Minister indicated the OPW believed it would have no difficulty in purchasing a premises in Newcastle West and has purchased the premises formerly used by the county council. I understand the OPW has surveyed the location.My question relates to the overall numbers who have applied for transfer to Newcastle West. Now that the premises has been purchased when does the Minister anticipate the relocation of people from Revenue in Dublin will take place? Is it envisaged that decentralisation to Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel will proceed at the same time or will it happen in a piecemeal fashion if, say, premises have been purchased in Newcastle West and the required number of applications for transfer there has been received? I am very interested in the Minister's answers to those questions.

I will start by stating that the Government is firmly committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme and is very pleased with the progress which has been achieved over the past ten months.However, a Government office cannot be relocated overnight. In order to do it correctly, the relocation of all or part of an organisation must be carefully planned and the new personnel must be in place before the physical move can take place. This is in addition to the procurement or construction of a suitable office premises.Regarding applications for Newcastle West on the central applications facility, 50 staff from the Revenue Commissioners are scheduled to transfer to Newcastle West. Up to and including 7 September last, which was the closing date for priority applications, a total of 109 applications had been received on the CAF. All of the applications are from civil servants. Of the 109 applications, 81 are from people currently employed by the Revenue Commissioners.The following is a brief analysis of the applications made for the positions advertised on the CAF. There are two applications from the assistant principal grade for one post advertised, three applications from the higher executive officer grade for three posts advertised, 32 applications from the executive officer grade for nine posts advertised, seven applications from the staff officer grade for three posts advertised, 49 applications from the clerical officer grade for 31 posts advertised and one application from a service officer against three posts advertised. In addition, there are 15 applications from people in grades other than those which are advertised on the CAF. Of the 109 applications, 102 were received from staff who are employed outside Dublin and the remaining seven are from people employed in Dublin.On foot of the Government decision, the Commissioners of Public Works advertised for suitable sites or buildings in the town of Newcastle West. Seventeen options were evaluated and a site proposed by Limerick County Council, at Bishop Street, was selected as the most suitable location for the Revenue Commissioners. A contract for sale has been received from Limerick County Council solicitors and it is currently with the Chief State Solicitor for approval. When all the legal formalities have been completed, the process of procuring the development of a suitable office building on the site for the Revenue Commissioners will proceed.The actual transfer will take place when a number of matters have been brought to a conclusion. These include the construction and fitting out a building on the site purchased and the moving, induction and training of the new staff who will transfer with the organisation.The next significant step in the decentralisation process will be a report by the implementation group, which is chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn, later in the autumn to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation. This will outline the group's views on sequencing and timing. The selection of organisations for inclusion in the first phase of moves will need to have particular regard to the figures emerging from the CAF and any relevant property and business aspects.Judging by the rate of applications to the CAF and the fact that the site is currently being acquired, Newcastle West should be in the first phase of decentralisation. I would not like to pre-empt the implementation group. However, in terms of meeting the criteria things are looking very good for Newcastle West. I am glad to have been able to give the Senator some good news.
