In this case the Taoiseach is refusing to answer such questions. While it is his sole prerogative to make these appointments, I wonder why this change has come about.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive, together.The British-Irish Council established under the British-Irish Agreement held its third summit meeting in Jersey on Friday, 14 June. The meeting was chaired by Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the States of Jersey Policy and Resources Committee. I was accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin. The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair and representatives from Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and Guernsey. Mr. David Trimble, First Minister, and Mark Durkan, Deputy First Minister, represented the Northern Ireland Executive.The main focus of the meeting was a discussion on the knowledge economy, on which Jersey is the lead administration, and plans for taking forward co-operation in this area within the British-Irish Council. The meeting highlighted the range of work being done in this important area and agreed that future work in the sector will include specific projects to address the issue of the digital divide – projects such as disabled access to ICT facilities and e-government. A group of knowledge economy officials from all administrations has been established to take this forward. Members also agreed to work together on the identification and development of pilot programmes for specific issues.Following the discussion on the knowledge economy, the council was updated by the relevant lead administrations on work being undertaken  in the other council sectoral areas including drugs, on which Ireland has the lead, the environment, social inclusion, transport, health and tourism. Following the summit meeting the British-Irish Council website was launched by Senator Horsfall.The next summit meeting of the British-Irish Council will be hosted by Scotland in November 2002 and that meeting will focus on the issue of social inclusion. The work we undertook in Jersey as well as the programme of work envisaged for the future are ample demonstrations that the council has an important role to play in developing relations between these islands and in addressing issues of common concern and interest to our peoples.Before the council meeting, I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Blair. We discussed, in particular, concerns about the peace process and the continuing disturbances in north and east Belfast. The situation in Belfast was also a particular focus of my meetings with First Minister David Trimble and Deputy First Minister Mark Durkan when I met them on 27 May and at my meeting with US Ambassador Haass on 11 June. The Government continues to maintain active contact on an ongoing basis with other Northern Ireland political parties.The British-Irish Agreement is the best hope for the future of Northern Ireland and it is important now for both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties to ensure that the Agreement is sustained. I look forward to a further meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council later this month. This will be the council's fourth plenary meeting and will allow the Government and the Executive to review progress in a number of cross-Border areas. The two Governments have also agreed to host a meeting in the near future of representatives of the pro-Agreement parties to ensure that momentum and confidence in the process is maintained and strengthened.Regrettably, the situation at interface areas in north and east Belfast over the past number of months has led to violence and increased tension between communities. This violence is also occurring in some of the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland. The situation demands real political and community leadership. It is vital that there is effective policing to ensure that the PSNI attracts the support and confidence of all sections of the community as it seeks to discharge its duties. I am concerned that, if allowed to continue, the violence and disturbances will inevitably increase divisions between communities even further and frustrate and debilitate the wider effort to bring stability and normality to Northern Ireland.In the course of my meeting with Prime Minister Blair, I again raised with him the importance of the British authorities providing material relevant to the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings inquiry requested by Mr. Justice Barron. I understand that Mr. Justice Barron intends to submit his report on the bombings in the autumn.On Tuesday, 11 June, I met with former Canadian Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Peter Cory. Judge Cory has been appointed by the two Governments to examine the cases of the murders of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson, Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson and Billy Wright. I thanked Judge Cory for agreeing to take on this important work which he is anxious to begin and intends to carry out as quickly as possible.I expect to meet with Prime Minister Blair again during the EU Council in Seville on 20-21 June. I have no immediate plans to visit the United States.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply to the 20 questions grouped together. Will the Taoiseach summarise what his new Government intends to do to maintain the momentum within the peace process and the British-Irish Agreement? In particular, what steps has he taken, together with the British Government, the Prime Minister and the Northern Ireland Executive, to deal with the continuing sectarian divide that has spilled over into communal violence in Belfast? Will the Taoiseach outline what proposals he has, as one of the major co-signatories of the British-Irish Agreement, to restore a sense of commitment to the benefits which were supposed to flow from that agreement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	9	We have, through the North-South Ministerial Councils and in direct meetings with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, looked at the main sectoral parts of the Agreement to see what progress has been made and what progress is necessary. There is ongoing progress in most of these areas, which are working well, but in others there is not as much progress as we would like and we will try to come to an agreement over the next 12 months or sooner on the action we need to take and the targets that need to be met in those particular areas. We have gone through the Agreement and I am glad to report to the House that progress is ongoing in most areas. The work within the Executive, with which we are not directly involved, is progressing and initiatives like the regeneration programme, which were launched some weeks ago, are designed to help target the areas of most disadvantage. Work in the North-South bodies, which slowed down for a while during the election here, has resumed and a range of meetings will be held before the summer break.On the difficulties at the interface areas, our people in the Secretariat have remained involved and closely in touch with the parties. I have personally had a number of meetings and the Minister for Foreign Affairs or officials have remained closely involved with the parties I have not met. Arguments can be made about who is to blame for what happened in various areas and the actions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in different circumstances, and we can go through  them one by one if necessary, but there is active engagement in communities across the divide to try to de-escalate some of these tensions.The new term being used in relation to some of the protests in Northern Ireland is "recreational rioting". I do not like the term because "recreational rioting" can easily move on to other rioting but for what it is worth, a distinction is being drawn between recreational rioting and more serious rioting. My own view is that it all has to be taken together and an effort made to encourage real liaison between the communities in whatever way possible. We have seen what happened in Ardoyne and in some areas where that has been facilitated by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and good progress has been made in that area. Last week the Minister, Martin McGuinness, offered the view that his colleagues would engage directly with loyalist leaders in other areas and the Loyalist Commission has issued its petition. If direct dialogue could be built up in these areas, there would be far less hassle this summer. Our part in that is to directly assist the sides in getting into that type of dialogue and we can play a useful role in encouraging them to do that.The other specific point I would like to mention concerns the Police Service of Northern Ireland which has done a very good job in some areas but has been highly criticised in others. We have been endeavouring, through Ambassador Haass, the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, and directly through Prime Minister Blair and others, to indicate in a fair way how the concerns expressed to us can be addressed on the ground and the new Chief Constable, Mr. Orde, can help in that regard.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Has he been made aware of the reports and comments by various politicians, including the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, that following the completion of the Good Friday Agreement and its ratification over the past number of years there is a sense that some sections of the loyalist community believe they are continuing to lose out and that their support for the Agreement has been diminished and is continuing to fall? Does the Taoiseach share that analysis, which is in part an explanation for the reaction of some sections of the loyalist community in the inter-communal areas of Belfast to which he refers? Does he agree with the analysis that in some way the Unionist-loyalist community feels under threat as a result of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement? What steps, if any, does he see the Government taking to reassure that section of the island's population that its place is secure and that the parity of esteem, to which the Agreement refers, will extend to all sections of the people?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	11	We are constantly being told that support for the Agreement is being eroded, but I believe, from all the many meetings I have  had in recent weeks, that underlying support for it and what we have been trying to achieve through it remains fundamentally sound. Difficulties have been highlighted and there may be a sense among considerable sections of the Unionist and loyalist community that they are losing out. However, reports of discussions with them indicate that they accept that an enormous amount is being achieved and, while there is some violence, it is sporadic and a level of reconstruction, regeneration and improvement with a positive approach is also present. The job of both Governments is to continue to give confidence and support in practical ways. I accept that there are some elements within the Unionist-loyalist community which have the view that things are not as good for them. I equally accept that the people of the Short Strand, who have seen their community dwindle considerably because of the difficulties over years, also feel that they are under huge threat. Such feelings are not mutually exclusive.The key issue is that we must maintain momentum in the process and do all we can by working closely with the pro-Agreement parties and other parties where possible to ensure that the implementation is fair and to the letter of the Agreement. There should be no advantage for one side over the other; it should be done fairly. Parity of esteem, equality and equity are all fundamental parts of the Agreement, just like demilitarisation and other issues, and should benefit the entire community. We are trying to ensure that every segment of the Agreement is fairly implemented and, in the next few weeks, we hope to have a summit of pro-Agreement parties to gauge where they are disappointed, where they want more progress and to see what can be done. We want a clear understanding of where the Agreement is four years on and how much can be done before the elections next May in Northern Ireland.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	In the context of the leader of the Labour Party raising the issue of parity of esteem, does the Taoiseach accept that the Government has a role in maintaining that parity in the eyes of all concerned? Does he accept that it is less than wise, as reported in the newspapers, for discussions to take place about possible links between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil and that talking up such reports does not serve well the sensitivities of the situation? As leader of Fianna Fáil, will he respond?Is the Government able to stand its own ground on intelligence, particularly in relation to the situation in Colombia? There were a number of British statements indicating that there was more to the Colombian mission than meets the eye. Is he able to work from Irish intelligence on this matter or is he depending on a pool of intelligence which may be British dominated? Is there Irish intelligence on this matter and, if so, is the Taoiseach able to tell us anything about it?In relation to parity of esteem, did the Taoi seach receive an invitation to the Jubilee celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II hosted recently by the British Ambassador? If not, was he represented at the celebrations or did he make a formal communication with the British Ambassador on the matter?Has the Taoiseach received an invitation to attend, or has the Government been asked to send observers, to any of the Northern marching events in the summer by way of ensuring flashpoints do not recur?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	13	With regard to the first matter raised by the Deputy, which is a party political one, I am not here to answer on that, but I read the reports with interest. The reporters probably had more information than I had as president of my party. That is all I can say on that matter. There have been no meetings. Perhaps it was the Greens who talked to them.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Maybe there is more than one Fianna Fáil Party.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It was not the Fianna Fáil Party.On the question of building confidence and parity of esteem, I will repeat what I said to Deputy Quinn. We can help in a number of ways. We can demonstrate in a competent manner that where there are issues creating difficulties on either side of the divide, we can usefully assist. My view is that this should be done in an even-handed and fair way, always communicating to both sides where we stand on what we can achieve and, where necessary, stating our concerns directly to the British Government or to the parties involved. It is my honest view that the Executive is working well and hard to help each other. I do not think there is tension or unfairness. People are anxious to help and, hopefully, at the meeting we will have with the pro-Agreement parties we will be able to achieve that.In relation to the Jubilee celebrations, I think all Ministers were asked. I did not attend, but some of my colleagues did.On the matter of intelligence in Colombia, I have heard many reports from people about their views on the position in Colombia, but we have no intelligence on the ground there. I am dependent on reports – conflicting ones – from others.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Conflicting reports?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I met the President of Colombia quite recently. The views were not only British. I have heard many views on this matter, but I have no particular view on it. I am more concerned about what is happening now and what will happen into the future. I cannot influence or change what happened in the past. While there are concerns and will continue to be concerns, the position as of now and going forward is what  really concerns the people in Northern Ireland who have raised this matter with me time and time again.In regard to building confidence, on some aspects of the Good Friday Agreement we have not achieved as much progress as we would have wished. Those are the areas on which we hope to get agreement. We hope to get a road map agreed at the next meeting. I have had a number of discussions with Mr. Trimble and Mr. Durkan, both separately and together, in the past few weeks and there is a determination that we agree these issues and then move forward. I have discussed that with most of the other pro-Agreement parties. I have discussed it with Sinn Féin and colleagues have discussed it with other parties and I think we can get an agreement to try to make progress at that meeting.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I thank the Taoiseach for his replies. The Taoiseach will recall that the Good Friday Agreement envisaged the completion of the decommissioning of illegal arms within two years of the referendum being held. Can he give the House any estimate of when the process will be completed? In view of the appalling lack of co-operation by the British Government with Mr. Justice Barron's commission of inquiry, does the Taoiseach share the concern of the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Does he feel that the British foot-dragging adds credence to the belief concerning involvement of British agencies in these tragedies?The Taoiseach is aware of the massive support in the country for the recent postcard campaign to pressurise the British Government to shut down Sellafield. Has he used any of the opportunities at his disposal to speak to the British Prime Minister about this?Has the Taoiseach spoken to the British Prime Minister about the Stevens report into alleged collusion between security forces and loyalist paramilitaries, part of which report was leaked to a British newspaper?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Decommissioning and the work of the International Commission on Decommissioning is ongoing. There have been substantive and extensive acts of decommissioning as reported by General de Chastelain and they are ongoing. There is no completion date as such but the extension made by the British Government and supported by me is the summer of next year. The process will be incremental and hopefully ongoing. There is no question of a deadline, which is never helpful, but what was set down is being delivered on and there is confidence in the process.In relation to Mr. Justice Barron, I passed on a memo last week from him to Prime Minister Blair and his officials reiterating what is required. He received an amount of information previously but has not got all the information he requires or answers to some of the issues he raised. Whether that information is available or will be handed  over is uncertain. We have had a commitment from the Prime Minister and from the Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, that they would provide everything they had through their own intelligence agencies. Mr. Justice Barron is still unsatisfied and that is the position.We continually raise the matter of Sellafield and ministerial colleagues are dealing with it. We look forward to the report on the Stevens inquiry. I do not want to comment on leaks of the report as, frankly, I do not know about it. We look forward to the report of Judge Cory, a competent, international and renowned judge, who has given his time to examine the papers in this area and to speak to the families and groups involved. He will spend much of the summer in Northern Ireland working on this which will be helpful. From my meeting with him last Tuesday I do not think he will spend an undue length of time on the work. He is determined to put in enormous effort to bring it to completion as quickly as possible. We have called many times for a public inquiry into these issues and we still hold that view. We will go through the process and wait for the report of the Stevens inquiry and the work of Judge Cory. If, at the end of that, there is still evidence of collusion in some of these cases we look forward to having a full public inquiry on these issues.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Will the Taoiseach get serious with the British Prime Minister and Government, two and a half years after the independent commission was set up to inquire into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings, about the continuing deficit of critical information, which they are clearly refusing to hand over? It beggars belief that the Taoiseach can say he still does not know whether information exists or is available. What does he talk about to the British Prime Minister when he raises this issue? Instead of passing over polite memos, will the Taoiseach take the gloves off and demand that the information is provided forthwith? It is months since a fresh request was sent by the commission for specific information but that information has not been received.Does the Taoiseach realise he is dealing with a Prime Minister who seems to be more concerned about where he came in the pecking order around the late Queen Mother's coffin than about matters of substantial social policy and justice? This is an issue of fundamental justice for the bereaved families and the victims. Since the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, apparently puts so much store by his public standing in the media, will the Taoiseach use the media to shame him into giving this information? This is the prime minister who has scurried around the world to be President Bush's outrider in a so-called war on terror yet, with regard to the single worst act of terror on this island—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	In fairness to other Members, I ask Deputy Higgins to confine him self to asking brief questions and not making statements.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I am doing that. The Taoiseach must get real. We must get real answers about what he intends to do to ensure the commission has the information well in advance of the end of September, when it is due to report, so it can get to the truth about this terrible atrocity.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Mr. Justice Barron has received an enormous amount of material from a range of sources, including the British Administration. It is important, in order to have as full and accurate a report as possible, that everyone with relevant information co-operates fully. As I pointed out to the last Dáil, Mr. Justice Barron has received some of the information he sought but not everything. It will be a matter for him to assess and comment in his report on the co-operation he has received from the various authorities with which he has been in contact. My role has been to endeavour, as best I can, to get that information.I do not know if the security information, which would be in the security sections of the British Government, is available. I do not have access to that information. All I can do is make the case that we require it. Whether it is available to be handed over or is handed over, we will read in due course in Mr. Justice Barron's report, which will come before a committee of the House for public scrutiny. In the meantime, we will put our full efforts into seeking the information Mr. Justice Barron still requires. However, it is not a question of the information being in this Prime Minister's or the previous Prime Minister's office. That is not the type of information about which we are talking.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier reply. Does he accept that the priority now for the First Minister and all Ministers in the Executive is to get on with the job they were elected to do in their respective Departments? Does he accept that Sinn Féin is fulfilling its mandate and responsibilities in the Executive and that there is no basis for the ongoing threat of the First Minister to bring down the Executive, which he repeated in the past week?I acknowledge the Taoiseach's reference to the situation in the Short Strand. Is he fully conversant with the conditions of daily life for that small community of some 3,000 souls who continue to suffer daily attempts by loyalist paramilitaries to carry out worse ravages of sectarian attack? What steps has the Taoiseach taken to have this matter raised with the British Prime Minister? Has the Taoiseach – he alluded to this matter in his earlier responses – raised the ongoing, very questionable activity of the RUC-PSNI, which has in some instances participated directly in some of these attacks upon defenceless communities already under attack from loyalist quarters?The Taoiseach said he did not like the term "recreational rioting", but while joining him in this, I would go further. We should not at any time give currency to the notion of recreational rioting. It is an absurdity and is absolutely offensive. I ask the Taoiseach, therefore, to join me in roundly rejecting all acts of sectarianism, as I did in my address last Sunday at Bodenstown, and to record appropriately whatever source such attacks might emanate from.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I have no difficulty joining anybody in wholeheartedly acknowledging and condemning all acts of violence, whatever source they emanate from, including any attempt to murder a recruit to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or intimidate Nationalists from joining the force. Whatever the level of violence, I roundly condemn it, and I hope everybody else in this House takes the same view.I am very well versed on the plight of the people of Short Strand and have enormous sympathy for the community there, which has dwindled from 10,000 people down to 3,000. They have suffered an enormous amount of hardship and intimidation on an ongoing basis. I have made the views of the Government known on the activities of the loyalists and the way the situation was policed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Government believes the handling of the situation left a lot to be desired, and we hope our representations will lead to some improvement. We made those representations directly to Secretary of State John Reid and to Ambassador Haass. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen has expressed our views in other meetings also, and I expressed them to Prime Minister Blair last Friday.In the interests of balance and fairness, I also congratulate the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the way it handled difficulties on the same weekend in other areas of Belfast, including Donegall Square, with great professionalism. The same police service operated under different commanders in those instances, and I have heard people who criticised the events in Short Strand also praised police activities elsewhere. This must be made clear for the purposes of even-handed debate.I have asked that we seek to achieve consistency in policing because that is how confidence can be developed in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Hopefully we can move on to a situation where everybody can be supportive of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, that all communities can join it and that we achieve a truly community-wide policing system like that of any other democracy. I am sure Deputy O'Caoláin does not agree with me totally on that but will come around to agreeing with me because it is the best way of dealing with these issues in the future.What was the Deputy's other question?

Does he agree they should be getting on with the work they have been elected to carry out, and does he accept that Sinn Féin is fulfilling its mandate and responsibilities in the Executive, that the ongoing threats of—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for reminding me of the question as I had forgotten it. As I said to Deputy Quinn, the Executive is working well and I do not see any reasons for a motion of exclusion. I gave my views on the matter last week and, thankfully, the meetings at the weekend went well. We should view all elements of the Good Friday Agreement and the normal day to day issues in the North in a positive manner. I remind those listening to this debate that things are calm among the vast majority of the citizens of the North. Investment, which has increased substantially, will be further considered at a conference in the United States in a few months. All members of the Executive are working on a regeneration programme, involving the investment of large amounts of capital in deprived areas, such as west and east Belfast, which need restoration, reinvigoration, investment and employment. I could mention many such good programmes and other positive aspects of the peace process.In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, if I were to make a criticism it would be that positive developments in the North are not publicised. Last Friday, for example, some of the best employment figures in the history of the North were announced, but it was difficult to find a politician of any persuasion to talk about them as they preferred to reflect on certain negative matters. I would like to hear those inside and outside the Executive talking positively as many good things are happening in areas such as health, education, enterprise, energy and transport. If we are to be balanced in our comments on the North, we should mention such matters. As I said to Deputy Quinn earlier, all political parties in the North should talk up the enormously improved situation there if we want to develop confidence in the Good Friday Agreement.

I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the body has contributed significantly to understanding and co-operation between the two peoples and the Parliaments. Members of the Government, including the Taoiseach who is a former joint chairman of the body, have served with great distinction on it. Does the Taoiseach envisage an enhancement of the body's powers? During his discussions with the First Minister, did the Taoiseach ask if Unionist politicians will take their places on the body? The effectiveness of the body would greatly increase if Unionists were present.

Most of the young people to whom I refer do not remember the violence during the armed conflict in the North. Have concerns been expressed in relation to the perception that the first generation for many years not to have suffered the direct consequences of violence appears to be more sectarian than older generations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	35	In reply to Deputy McGinley's queries about the important matter of the future of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, it was discussed at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Council. We were unable to come to an agreement at the previous council meeting. Deputy McGinley alluded to the fact that it was agreed some time ago that changes would be made to allow members from other Administrations to sit on the body, but Unionists did not take up that option. What was agreed last Friday was that over the next few months an effort will be made to make whatever institutional changes are necessary to bring everyone on side. Given the brief flavour of the discussions and the comments I had afterwards with some of the leaders I think that will be possible. It may be the end of the year – perhaps following the November meeting – before the matter is formally concluded. I asked recently that this should happen more quickly so that the committees here can be set up and it was agreed the issue would be looked at. There is now movement on the issue which, I hope, will be resolved later this year.I did not have discussions on the issue raised by Deputy Quinn. Obviously the sectarianism which exists at the interface and in communities is a matter of major concern. It is a concern that there are still efforts on both sides to drive communities out of areas. The major emphasis is to continue to support cross-community programmes, promote the efforts being made in regard to education and build up confidence in these communi ties. However, as the Deputy pointed out, there are still major difficulties. Even though progress is being made and community leaders and political parties are working very hard to try to gain control there are still difficulties. There is not as much progress as one would like and we must continue to work on these problems. It is true of any city that where there is deprivation and social difficulties it is easier for such problems to exist. Rejuvenation and regeneration programmes would help to put an end to these activities. It is worrying that people are still being intimidated and forced out of communities.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I will begin by congratulating Deputy Hogan on his much deserved elevation to the Fine Gael Front Bench. I look forward to working with him over the next five years.I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 87 together.The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday, 10 June 2002. I have received a copy of the report. The court has ordered that the report not be published or its contents disclosed. The matter was adjourned for further consideration on 24 June 2002.The question of the disposition of the report is entirely a matter for the High Court. As I have made publicly clear on a number of occasions, it is my stated wish that the contents of the report should be published in full. It is my intention to seek to be represented at the proceedings on 24 June where I propose to set out the reasons it would be in the public interest that the report be published in full and as expeditiously as possible.In the event that the court feels that further consideration needs to be given to the question of publication of the report, I intend seeking to  have the report made available immediately to all relevant competent authorities so that action can be initiated on foot of the material gathered by the inspectors. It is a matter for the relevant competent authorities to follow up on issues raised in the report.The investigation and prosecution of company law matters, for which I formerly had statutory responsibility, is now the sole responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who has received a copy of the report. The director has indicated publicly that his immediate task will be to study the report and determine the appropriate response for his office.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I thank the Tánaiste for her kind opening remarks.The establishment of the position of Director of Corporate Enforcement and allowing the Ansbacher report, when published, to be given to that individual is an opportunity for the Tánaiste to side-step the issue and to let some quango or agency deal with a very important matter. The Tánaiste promised some time ago that she was going to clean up business and financial malpractice and appointed an inspector in her Department to get to the bottom of the various matters that will be referred to in this report. She expressed surprise at the extent and wide variety of irregular dealings in the financial and business sectors and she expressed surprise at the names she found coming up in relation to different dealings which were deemed to be irregular. Why then does she not take responsibility for her inspector's report and for the work that has been done in her Department, rather than side-step it and pass it to another inspector of corporate enforcement?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The law does not entitle me to take any immediate action. This House passed the legislation to establish the independent office with the enthusiastic support of Fine Gael. It is appropriate that company law be enforced on a fair and independent basis, not at the whim of the Minister of the day. In planning appeals, public prosecutions and corporate enforcement, we have all seen that offices should act totally independently, without fear or favour and without political influence.The office is appropriately resourced and is staffed by members of the Garda, barristers and accountants, whereas company law heretofore was enforced by one and a half officials in my Department who also had other responsibilities. Quite honestly, company law enforcement was not taken seriously and this only began to change when Deputy Rabbitte was in the Department and the Company Registrations Office was put on a new footing. Over the past 12 months it has been taken seriously for the first time.In relation to the report and to company law inquiries, nobody ever initiated 13 inquiries into allegations of breaches of company law. It is very significant and hopefully it will be a watershed,  but the most significant outcome from all of this is that we have an independent office. I did not wait until this report was to hand to establish that. It was evident to me in 1999 that a new direction and a new way of enforcing the law was necessary and that is why we proceeded with the establishment of the office, which has been well received in most quarters. Its establishment was supported by everybody in this House.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Has the Tánaiste established if she will be heard on 24 June? I presume that if her locus standi is established she will argue that the report be brought into the public domain.In terms of her previous references to these investigations and to the fact that she was shocked and alarmed at some of the discoveries that came to her attention, now that she has read the report has she changed her mind with regard to her previous characterisation of the players in this drama?In the context of some of the comment one occasionally reads, is it possible that some of the players whose names will come into the public domain may be entirely innocent of wrongdoing?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I cannot comment on the report. The Deputy will appreciate that the President of the High Court ordered that the report be given to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and to me and that we are not at liberty to disclose its contents to anybody or to make comment on it. In fairness, if I make any comment I could be on very thin ice and I do not want to go there. It is far to serious. The matter will be before the Court on Monday and I understand I will be heard. The fact that the President of the High Court facilitated the making available of a copy to me leads me to believe, from legal advice, that we will be heard then.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I am not surprised that the Tánaiste mentioned 13 inquiries. They never had to be done before and there was good reason that they had to be undertaken over the last number of years. Hopefully, this will not be repeated ever again to the extent that there was political involvement in these matters apart from individuals outside the political domain.I do not know why the Tánaiste will not give us a flavour of the course of action she will be taking on 24 June. In view of her strongly held views about the issues involved and the access to information which she has had for a considerable period of time through her own inspector's report, will she confirm that she carried out her own report and that she had information at her disposal which she could have acted on? Why did she do nothing to deal with these issues, allowing them instead to go the High Court, as opposed to acting on her own inspector's report, which was carried out some years ago?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I did take action and there were several prosecutions. If the Deputy is familiar  with some of the other reports he will know that people were successfully prosecuted under various provisions of the Companies Acts. I set up the new office, but I was not at liberty to act in relation to the Ansbacher report until the inspectors had completed their inquiry. The initial section 8 inquiry, carried out by the authorised officer, Gerard Ryan, was preliminary and his findings warranted the appointment of High Court inspectors which the court acceded to. In my affidavit to the court I stated the reasons I believed such inspectors were appropriate as they have substantially more powers than a section 8 inquiry. In particular, they have powers to take evidence on oath and to compel people to attend and give evidence. That is a very substantial power.I am not going to say what the flavour of my remarks will be, but the report has cost €3 million to date. We know from the Revenue Commissioners that they have collected €17 million on account from 50 of the people involved, which is public information given in this House some time ago by the Minister for Finance. These are the figures to the end of March. If a report has cost €3 million, it should be provided to the public and I will argue the reasons I believe that in court next Monday, subject to legal advice.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I am not teasing the Tánaiste on to thin ice when I ask her if she now resiles in any way from her previous characterisation of the report. It is a fair question. Will she tell the House if she would be happy if through legal intervention or other means some of the main players in the Ansbacher affair were successful in causing this report not to be published?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I would not be happy if that were the case. The court made a decision on this matter when an application was made by two individuals to challenge anonymously. It was refused and I welcome that. It was a good decision, but clearly one for the courts.The report cost €3 million to date and that was money well spent.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The PPF contains a commitment to reduce overall place numbers on CE to 28,000 by 2003 through a reallocation of funding equivalent to 5,000 places to the social economy, together with the reduction of 4,500 places required by the Government's decision of 21 July 1999.The mainstreaming of school services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. This has been confirmed by my Department in detail on a number of occasions in the context of discussions with the social partners on the PPF standing committee on labour market matters. I have also made this position clear in my responses to a number of previous parliamentary questions on the restructuring of CE.There were 30,809 participants on CE at the beginning of 2002 and it is anticipated that the year-end participation rate will be in the region of 24,000 to 25,000 places depending on the rate of inflows and outflows on the scheme. This phased reduction in place numbers is part of a strategic shift in policy in favour of greater investment in training and other supports, for example, social economy and the new high supports process, which I will launch shortly.I am fully aware of the concerns of sponsors from community organisations regarding the implications of the reduction in CE places for the provision of community services. In this regard I emphasise that FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and will co-ordinate reductions to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Priority groups include the drugs task forces, child care service provision and designated disadvantaged areas covered by the new RAPID programme and the BMW region.In addition, the social economy programme is available to support the development of social economy enterprises that will benefit the economic and social regeneration of communities. Local social economy working groups have been established in the 38 designated disadvantaged partnership areas and in 16 non-partnership  areas. In this way, the social economy is targeted at areas which traditionally have had high dependence on services provided under CE.A review of active labour market programmes, as provided for under the PPF, has recently commenced under the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. The committee includes representatives of the community pillar, employers and trade unions, as well as other Departments and FÁS. Consultants have recently been appointed by my Department to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of existing programmes, which will help to inform the deliberations of the standing committee. Terms of reference for the consultants' work were agreed by a steering group representing the standing committee, which included all the social partners.I fully recognise the range of valued services across communities which have been provided with the support of CE. The mainstreaming initiative recognises that certain key support services, such as in the education and health areas, can best be provided through the Department with functional responsibility in the relevant area. This is why the appropriate funding transfers from FÁS to the Departments in question are taking place. FÁS is undertaking its own internal review of the scheme, which should further inform the prioritising of activity within CE, taking account of the needs of disadvantaged groups and the provision of services to areas experiencing severe social and economic disadvantage. The future policy direction of active labour market programmes, including CE, will be informed by the outcome of these processes.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Is the Minister saying the cause of concern of all the people who marched on her advice centres and press conferences during the election and all the deputations that sought to meet her was ill-founded? Is she denying that there is confusion at the heart of the operation of these schemes now; that people are being disemployed as we speak; that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is up in arms about not having been consulted; that the terms of reference as agreed in the social contract, the PPF, are not being adhered to on the side of the Government; and that there is widespread concern about the impact on badly needed community services of the cutbacks that are being implemented operationally, irrespective of her protestations that this is not happening? Is it not fair for this side of the House to inquire of the Minister to make clear whether these cuts are taking place with her authority and that of the Department?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I know my reply was long but I said there were 30,800 places on CE schemes at the start of the year and by year end there will be between 24,000 and 25,000. In addition, a number of places has been mainstreamed and transferred to the Department of Education and Science. However, I will put this in perspective for the  Deputy. Five years ago, 72,500 people were involved in community employment and various other training initiatives while today there are 74,000. We are spending more than €200 million more per year on training and community employment than five years ago. At that time the unemployment rate was 11% while it is now 4%, the long-term unemployment rate was almost 6% and this has reduced to 1.3% and there was one CE place for every 2.5 long-term unemployed person and that has been reduced to one place per 0.7 long-term unemployed persons. There has been improvement on three fronts. The emphasis, including by the social partners, has been to try to get people into training so that they can be equipped with the skills for a real job in the labour market.Two issues concern me. The first relates to individuals involved in CE schemes who, for whatever reason, are not in a position to take up a job when they complete the scheme. That is a huge concern and I will announce a new process shortly for dealing with these hard cases. These individuals require much more intensive assistance and mediation from FÁS. The second issue relates to the services and activities that would not exist were it not for CE such as those provided in schools, in the areas of health, the environment and so on. The process of mainstreaming services began in schools last year and will continue shortly in regard to health and environmental services because we must get away from the notion of stop-start support for worthwhile activities.There are approximately 70,000 foreign workers in Ireland. Employers are seeking work permits on their behalf and so far this year 18,000 have been granted. This is in addition to those who come here from the European economic area who do not require work permits. It would be irresponsible of me as Minister with responsibility for employment and training not to respond to the significant changes taking place in the labour market. There is a number of separate issues that must be dealt with in a different context. The social economy is part of that. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has been given responsibility for community services and I shortly hope to discuss the role that mainstreaming CE can play in supporting worthwhile activities on the ground.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Minister could have saved herself a great deal of trouble in dealing with the co-ordination of the new initiatives that she proposes to take in the near future if she had done so in more thoughtful fashion months ago when individuals and community groups contacted Members regarding their concerns about continuing their programmes through FÁS over the next few years under the CE scheme. The Minister referred to a stop-go approach but communities have been engaged in such an approach because the Minister and FÁS have not ensured there is planned and co-ordinated implementation of FÁS social economy schemes, which are essential  to fill gaps in the labour market in the areas of health, education and the environment.What analysis has been carried out by the Department to verify that CE schemes are not operating to the standard it wishes and that another scheme which the Minister is about to announce will be better? Is she aware that FÁS has no problem spending money on job creation at its headquarters through the provision of directorships and supervisory positions while the number of places on employment schemes is being reduced at local level where the real work is being done?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Hear, hear.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I do not accept that people with special needs, who do essential work in communities, should suffer while top level positions are created at national level by FÁS at extra financial cost.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The number of places is a function of two factors, one of which is the level of unemployment. Let us be honest. Community employment and its forerunner, social employment, were introduced at a time of high unemployment to reduce the numbers on the live register. That is a fact. At a time in the 1990s when the economy was growing we still had a growth in joblessness and high levels of unemployment as a result of which the numbers on CE schemes were extended. Since then there has been a dramatic transformation in this economy, particularly in the area of employment, and we have ended forced emigration. We must respond to that and there are two things we could do. We could reduce the number of people in mainstream training and maintain the high numbers in community employment, something I do not believe would be sensible. I believe it is preferable to equip very young people with a skill for a real job which will see them through their entire working lives and provide higher incomes and greater prosperity than to maintain them on community employment. A number of years ago, we decided to increase the age threshold for participation in community employment to encourage those young people into mainstream training and this is working extremely well.We are not introducing new schemes; the social economy came out of a consultation process under the PPF and is working well. Although only in its infancy, it is developing a new model for the creation of enterprises in the community particularly in disadvantaged areas.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The time has expired for these two questions.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	56	An agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The implementation group which was set up at the end of April 2002, is making good progress on the preparation of an action plan to give effect to the 67 recommendations. The action plan, which I intend to make publicly available, will contain a target timeframe for the implementation of the recommendations.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	57	It took the previous Government five years to notice that there was a problem with insurance. I know that the Tánaiste and other Members were being regularly lobbied by young people and business interests. Lo and behold, the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which took three years to compile, was published a couple of weeks before the general election. The timing could not have been better from a political point of view but young people and business people must suffer on due to the failure to face up to the vested interests. Is the Tánaiste aware that in 2001 the annual insurance premium for a typical grocery and electrical shop rose from €21,000 to €31,000? Is she aware that small businesses in the construction sector must pay enormous increases in premia from €14,000 in 2001 to €38,000, for employer's and public liability insurance? Is she aware that a 20 year old male driver seeking insurance for the first time could pay up to €6,000 for third party, fire and theft cover? These are the realities.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Deputy must ask a question.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Is the Tánaiste aware that there is a 35% increase in premia for household insurance although cover is being reduced? What timescale is the Tánaiste setting for the implementation of this report's key recommendations? She stated recently that she intends to tackle some of the professional groups, particularly the legal profession, which are contributing to the high cost of insurance. Can the Tánaiste give some hope to  young people seeking their first motor insurance cover?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I am aware of the interesting statistics quoted by Deputy Hogan but the subject of the question is motor insurance. Nobody who lives in this country could be unaware of the prohibitively high cost of motor insurance for all drivers but particularly for young people. It is a fact that the number of fatalities on the roads relative to the number of cars halved in the period 1990 to 2000 but insurance increased by 57% and rose by 18% in 2001 alone. Notwithstanding some of the changes made in the past such as the abolition of the two senior counsel rule and jury trials, there was still no visible effect on the cost of premiums.I reiterate that this issue is my political priority in the Department and, in so far as I can drive this agenda politically, I intend to do so over the coming months. I had a long meeting yesterday with all the relevant officials in my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish the targeted timeframe in September or October after I have presented it to Government in early September.Deputy Hogan is correct that this is not just an issue of motor insurance; there are wider implications and huge changes which must be made across various Departments. Of the report's 67 recommendations, 17 relate to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, so this agenda must be driven across Government if we are to achieve fundamental change. I expect to see the long-promised quid pro quo from the insurance companies when we introduce the changes. I hope to establish the PIAB on an interim basis very quickly, pending the passing of the legislation in the House. The companies must then provide a clear and visible quid pro quo for consumers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	61	There is a rumour that general insurance companies are no longer happy to trade in the Irish market and could decide to pull out if action is not taken by the Government to deal with the issues elucidated by the Tánaiste. Does the Tánaiste believe that a cartel is operating in the insurance business in Ireland, particularly in motor insurance, because of the small number of companies willing to quote in this jurisdiction? What measures would the Tánaiste be happy to see implemented in the motor insurance industry by the end of her term of office?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Government can do a number of things but societal changes are also required. The compensation culture is extraordinary. We all know that the person who can get an easy €5,000 or € 10,000 compensation is regarded as a hero in the workplace. We must root out the "compo culture". There are some immediate steps which can be taken. I have been in contact with the Office of the Attorney General in order to draft regulations which will require insurance companies to give customers at least 15 days  notice of the cost of their premium and details of the no claims bonus so that the consumer can then shop around. If notice of the premium cost is given on a Friday and the insurance is due on a Saturday or Sunday, then clearly the consumer does not have many options.

We have huge issues to deal with in order to create a more competitive market. We must get rid of some of the inefficiencies in regard to claims and devise a simpler method for making claims.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I do not think he is going to Europe, Deputy Rabbitte.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I bet he is not going back to insurance.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 95 together.The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday, 10 June 2002. I am conscious that I gave the same answer to an earlier question and apologise to the House for the repetition. I would take it as read although Deputy O'Keeffe may not have been here earlier.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I heard the answer.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Then we can save time.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I am aware from the Minister's earlier comments that she cannot comment  on the report but I am interested to know what will be her instructions to counsel for the State next Monday? It is probably taken as read that the Minister will be seeking to have the report made public. Will she be seeking any other orders from the court next Monday arising from this report? Any such approach to the court on her behalf would be made in public so it is not a question of her commenting on the report in any way. What is her attitude to those who claim that they have been innocently maligned by being included in the report? Apart from the publication issue, will the Tánaiste instruct counsel to seek any other orders on behalf of the State?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The answer to that is "no". It is open to the presiding judge to inquire of the inspectors and to make a decision based on what they say as to where costs should be levied, for example. This is something in which I have an interest, but it will be a matter for the presiding judge after hearing what the inspectors might say in relation to it. Following up is clearly a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners and other competent authorities. If there are names of innocent people who might be maligned, it is a matter for the presiding judge. I am certain that given that Mr. Justice Finnegan took some time before he made a decision on this matter, these issues will all be reflected on appropriately by the court. It will be purely a matter for the court.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Regarding following up, I will not ask the Tánaiste to give a guarantee but is she satisfied that there can be no repetition of this kind of scandal and that the steps taken, such as establishing the Director of Corporate Enforcement, are adequate? Does she have any further proposals to try to ensure that there will be no scandals of this kind again?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I would be very foolish if I was to say that there would never be tax evasion again. It is in the nature of a human being to try to avoid paying tax if he or she can get away with it, but hopefully, with greater vigilance from the Revenue Commissioners, which we have seen in recent years, and reports like this, there can be a new culture and a new regime. Thankfully, lower tax rates may help as well.Regarding other measures, the new regime we are about to put on a statutory basis for the auditing profession, which will require auditors to report any wrongdoing or breaches in the Companies Acts to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, will be very significant. It will place a huge onus on members of the auditing profession to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities cases where they have reason to believe the law has been broken. That is significant. Auditors have huge powers and it is appropriate that they should have responsibilities. The proposal was criticised in a newspaper today but it has been introduced on foot of a recommend ation of the group established after the DIRT inquiry to look at the auditing profession.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	75	During the course of this controversy and the investigations, was the Tánaiste or any member of the Government, to her knowledge, approached or did anyone seek to make representations to her or to any member of Government on the subject matter of this report?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I cannot make a comment in that regard except to say, as I have said before, that this is a very small country and people frequently meet each other. People are often capable of making their views known.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	77	If I was to interpret that for the House as the Tánaiste saying that she has had her ear bent by those whose names are likely to emerge in this report, would I be accurately interpreting the Tánaiste?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I would answer it like this: those who might be mentioned in the report are very vociferous and more than able to make their points of view known.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	79	As a further follow-up to that, does the Tánaiste feel it would be appropriate to give a little more information to the House apart from saying people are vociferous? Were they vociferous in the right ears? Did they represent views to her or her colleagues? Now that the issue has been raised by Deputy Rabbitte, she should be more explicit and I invite her to do so on the record of the House.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I suppose that in the past we were always very good at avoiding what one would broadly call political hot potatoes. That is why it is significant that we have a new independent office where these issues will be handled on a purely independent basis. Everyone here accepts that the Director of Public Prosecutions, An Bord Pleanála and bodies of that kind act totally independently and that is how it should be in relation to such matters. The people who carried out this investigation, including the authorised officer of my Department and the inspectors, including Mr. Justice Costello, who unfortunately had to stand down, are very honourable people and they have done a very good job. We have the capacity, even in a small country, to carry out very sensitive reports of this kind and to do so professionally and properly.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I was interested that the Tánaiste said that even though these matters are before the courts, people felt they could approach her in relation to them. She said we live in a small country but why did they feel they could approach her in relation to these matters if they are before the courts?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I am not suggesting that anyone  has approached me or anyone else about matters which are before the courts.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Tánaiste is not doing her reputation for forthright responses much good. She will remember occasions such as the beef tribunal when full and frank replies were not given in the House. It is in everyone's interest that this be clarified. Were approaches made in relation to this report with a view to ensuring it was not published or from any other point of view and, if so, to whom? This issue will not go away and I invite the Tánaiste to clarify it fully from the point of view of her reputation and because the House is entitled to know.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Deputy can take it that, since the inspectors were appointed, the report has been concluded and it is now a matter for the courts, nobody succeeded in preventing all that happening.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	85	That was not the question.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	86	That should be evidence to everybody that the law is taking its course. That is the way it should be.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	88	That is the answer the Deputy is getting and there is no need to get anything else.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	89	There will be.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	90	It is reasonable for this side of the House to inquire of the Tánaiste if it is a reasonable inference to take from her replies so far that representations were made either to her and-or other members of the Government about the subject matter of this report. We ought to hear from her without drawing any judgment about what the nature of the response was to such representations – if those representations were made – if she can say by whom they were made. If she cannot tell us that, she ought to be able to tell us to whom they were made. During this controversy and her own public remarks on it, did any colleague in Government make any representations to her on behalf of any person who believed he or she might be implicated in the subject matter of the report?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I said on many occasions in the House that several lawyers were in touch with me in relation to Gerard Ryan's inquiry. I said that here before, in 1998 and 1999. Several lawyers in this town made representations, if that is the word, in relation to these matters. I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance as the competent authority about previous reports but if the Deputy is asking me if anyone made representations to me to back off, if that is the intention of the question, the answer to that is "no".
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Since receiving the report has the Tánaiste consulted any member of the Government regarding its contents?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Is the Tánaiste aware she is whetting the appetite by dribbling out the last bit of information about the Dublin lawyers making representations to her? We need to know, if not the names of the lawyers, the number involved, the kind of representations and the response to such representations.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I ask Deputy Rabbitte to be brief because we are almost out of time.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Can the Tánaiste understand that we are not merely arguing or asking questions about the report as finalised and which is before the court, but during the entire course of this controversy were such representations as we have spoken about made to her or made to the Government or by any member of the Government to her? Can she say whether in all cases where these lawyers made such representations they specified on whose behalf they were making them?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The answer to the first part of Deputy Rabbitte's question is "no". In regard to the second part of his question, invariably the lawyers would say on whose behalf they were writing. Clearly, the Attorney General would respond on my behalf and the authorised officer would be made aware of any legal issues raised by individuals concerned. It is fair to say that the Minister of the day in the context of the former law, before we moved it to an independent process, had discretion about whether to have any of these inquiries. To recap, these inquiries came about after the McCracken report. Nobody called for them either in this House or elsewhere. I initiated those inquiries on foot of the McCracken report and on foot of the report from Gerard Ryan. I went one step further. That is always a matter of discretion. One is not forced to do these things.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	97	A Cathaoirleach, I do not think you should allow it stay on the record of the House that nobody in this House asked for inquiries into these matters. That would not be historically correct.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	98	It was done the day after the McCracken report.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I am not denying that.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	100	It was not done as a result of political pressure. It was done because it was the right thing for Ministers to do on foot of the McCracken report. All of these inquiries, both the tribunals of inquiry and the company law investigations, will change the culture because the greatest deterrent is enforcing the law. That the law will be enforced, without fear or favour, is  the greatest deterrent to ensuring we do not have tax evasion on the same scale as in the past.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	101	FÁS has a comprehensive approach and support system for workers who are threatened with, or affected by, redundancy.Where people lose their jobs by way of redundancy, FÁS has a procedure for putting supports in place prior to the date of redundancy to enable employers and employees to prepare for exit planning related to retraining or alternative job-seeking. Where such redundancies affect large numbers, then other agencies are involved, for example, the IDA, Forfás, local enterprise boards, partnerships, LES and Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.Appropriate supports include individual interviews, career evaluation, career planning, retraining or training upgrades and job matching with local vacancies that may exist. Where appropriate, specific training courses are set up.Where the job losses are of a different nature and people register with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as unemployed there is a standard procedure in place between both FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to point such people towards the variety of FÁS services available to their particular needs.In both scenarios, the supports are delivered by FÁS throughout its network and are processed on an integrated basis through employment offices, training centres, community offices and services to employers. These interventions were a key component of the successful strategy pursued by the last Government that delivered economic and social progress through job creation with the resultant low unemployment rates.The new Government recently reaffirmed its commitment in the programme for Government which stated "FÁS will engage with redundant workers and people facing the prospect of long-term unemployment to ensure that the period out of work for a substantial number of people is kept to a minimum."  I assure the House it is a commitment that will be delivered upon.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Are adequate resources available to FÁS to continue its existing programme of supports for various social employment schemes throughout the country while at the same catering for the contingencies that are likely to arise in relation to jobs lost or in doubt?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	103	When particular companies close or make a large number of workers redundant, FÁS tends to come in with a customised initiative. We have seen great success in this area. For example, former textile workers have been equipped with IT skills for new jobs which in many cases pay substantially more money. That tends to be the response. There are substantially more people in training now than ever before. It is important in particular that those who have been in traditional employment have the opportunity to access a new skill to enable them obtain a job in a different sector. That is a priority for FÁS. Given that the number of redundancies this year is higher than last year it is becoming a greater problem. I have no evidence to suggest that a significant number of current redundant workers are not in a position to access appropriate training within a reasonable timeframe.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	104	With due respect, the question was whether adequate resources are available to FÁS to cater for those job losses and retraining places required while at the same time continuing to support the various social employment schemes, referred to in previous parliamentary questions, which have been the cause of some concern throughout the country by various voluntary groups and those involved in organising social employment schemes during the past 12 months. That part of the question is still unanswered.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Which is the Deputy asking about, the services or the individuals?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I am asking about the services and the availability of financial supports for the various schemes.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I said in reply to an earlier question that there are two issues in regard to community employment, namely, the individuals involved and the cutbacks and reductions. Clearly one has to remain concerned about individuals who may not be able to access a job in the economy. That is the reason we will ensure some more intensive work is done with people who, for whatever reason, do not seem able to make that progression. There is a wide range of activity supports. There are about 3,000 community employment schemes. A large number of services is provided through community employment. The intention is to mainstream community employment because there cannot be the stop-start approach for many of these organisations which find it difficult to provide the service and in many cases would not be able to provide the service without support from the State.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The resources will not be adequate to continue to support the two types of service to which I have referred.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I am pleased to get a chance to speak. This issue relates to a question I have  tabled. I do not think many people would argue against the mainstreaming of some community employment jobs. It makes sense for the Department of Education and Science rather than FÁS to decide where resources go. The same could be said in regard to the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in terms of community employment schemes. The position is unclear regarding the transfer from community employment schemes to other areas. Deputy Rabbitte was correct when he made the point—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I am reluctant to intervene but it is important to point out that Question Time is purely for the benefit of Members to elicit information from the Minister.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I am coming to the question.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	112	As such it is important that Members ask brief questions.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Given the increasing redundancies and the changes occurring in the economic sphere, will the Minister reconsider the work permit scheme?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Yes, we have made some changes. We have made it somewhat more difficult for employers to get a work permit. The fee has been substantially increased. It is a requirement that they must first go to FÁS who must be satisfied that there is no Irish person or European citizen available to do the work before a recommendation for a permit is granted. We probably need to do more. It is the intention to put the work permit regime on a statutory footing and, perhaps, to introduce the concept of a green card but that is a separate issue. Clearly we have been more vigilant in areas where there have been substantial job losses. FÁS has been vigilant in trying to ensure employers access the local available labour before a permit is issued.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	115	My Department is considering the implications of the admission made in the court case. This involves issues of some complexity and relates to events which took place during the 1980s. Some of these issues will require legal advice and my Department will be approaching the Attorney General's Office in that regard in the very near future.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Does the Minister recall giving me precisely this answer on 21 March and does she agree it is a long time since 21 March, notwithstanding intervening events and 18 June, in terms of taking advice from the Attorney General's office? Does the Minister agree it is a matter of some importance that a significant businessman in this jurisdiction may have misrepresented to the Fair Trade Commission in 1989 his beneficial interest in the take-over of Master Meats? Is it not the case that on the word of his lawyers before the recent court case, Mr. Goodman lied to the Fair Trade Commission? Has the Minister established whether the evidence given to the Fair Trade Commission at that time was taken on oath? If it was, is she contemplating a certain course of action? When does she expect to have the advice of the Attorney General and, apart from telling me for the second time that her Department is concerned that Mr. Goodman misrepresented the position—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	117	A question, please.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I am asking a question. Given Mr. Goodman's misrepresentation of the position, does the Department intend taking whatever action is open to it at this stage?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I am aware the reply is similar to the one given on 21 March and I apologise for that. It is not the case, however, that nothing has happened. There have been ongoing discussions with the Attorney General's office on this matter. To the best of my memory – this is subject to memory as I do not have information in that regard in my brief – evidence to the Fair Trade Commission was not taken on oath. Given the complexity and problematic nature of this matter the Department is preparing a detailed submission for the Attorney General's office and that should be ready fairly quickly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Does the Minister agree—

It is the case that what the lawyers for the individual concerned said in the Master Meats case is different from what was said to the Fair Trade Commission. To disguise beneficial ownership is a serious matter. Deputies appear to be more concerned about what is happening behind me than with my reply. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	140	In the midst of the general election campaign, an old political soldier passed away in his native Clare at the age of 76. The late Sylvester Barrett was held in high esteem by the community and people of County Clare whom he served in public life as a member of Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament. He inherited a rich tradition of public service and patriotism from his father, Frank, who had been commandant in the mid-Clare brigade of the Old IRA, and as a member of Clare County Council. Sylvester Barrett entered politics in 1968 on the occasion of a by-election caused by the death of Deputy Bill Murphy. He was elected in the general election of the following year and topped the poll for the revised constituency of Clare-South Galway. In 1977, he was appointed Minister for the Environment by Jack Lynch and among the decisions he took was to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory, the introduction of the breathalyser test and many others related to safety.He subsequently served as Minister for Defence and Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works under Mr. Haughey. It was in the latter capacity that he declared the Burren a national park. In 1984, he was elected to the European Parliament. He did not seek re-election in 1987 and retired from the European Parliament in 1989. Throughout his  life, Sylvester Barrett was a committed member of the Fianna Fáil Party and as a mark of the esteem in which he was held, he was appointed honorary president of the Fianna Fáil organisation in County Clare.Sylvester Barrett was a keen sportsperson. He had a particular passion for greyhounds and horse racing. He would be known to many people in this House and continued to have an enormous interest in the work of the House. He was a man who had wide interests and many friends and he worked hard for the people he represented. He believed in public service and whether in Dublin or Brussels, he never forgot the people he was elected to serve in Clare.I want to take the opportunity to express my sincere sympathies and the sincere sympathies of the Fianna Fáil Party to Sylvester's wife, Mary, his sons, Frank, Joe, Syl and Tom, his brother, Frank, and his sisters, Anna and Sister Gertrude.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Ba mhaith liom ómós a thabhairt don iar-Theachta, Sylvester Barrett, a fuair bás le déanaí. Ba iad mhuintir Chondae an Chláir a bhí mar phríomh chúram aige agus é ina Theachta Dála.Sylvester Barrett was born on the same day as the foundation of Fianna Fáil in 1926. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in a by-election in 1968 following the death of the then Fine Gael Member, Deputy Bill Murphy, and he served as Minister for Local Government in the 1977 Fianna Fáil Government. He is remembered particularly for awarding a general amnesty giving full driving licences to provisional drivers, one of whom is sitting beside me. He was the first person to oversee the running of the newly created Department of the Environment, putting in place environmental policies which provided a platform for successive Governments. He also served as Minister for Defence between 1979 and 1981 and Minister of State at the Department of Finance in 1982 before running for the European Parliament in 1984, where he served with distinction until 1989. He retired from Dáil Éireann in 1987 when he did not seek re-election.He was regarded, first and foremost, as being a real Clare man and as a Deputy between 1968 and 1987. He sought principally to promote the interests of his native county and the mid-west region. He was the Fianna Fáil spokesman on energy in the mid-1970s when he was recognised as an authority on the subject during the world oil crisis at that time. I regret that he suffered a debilitating stroke in December 1997. He is survived by his wife, Mary, his sons, Frank, Joe, Syl and Tom, his brother, Frank, and his sisters, Sister Anna and Sister Gertrude.It should be noted that there was an extremely strong Fianna Fáil tradition in the Barrett household. A famous incident in County Clare was when his aunt Peg threw herself in front of the armed forces who were there to arrest de Valera  in the square in Ennis, a much remarked upon event in political life in Clare.Sylvester Barrett will be remembered for being a kind and generous spirit, a true Clare man who sought at all times to promote the welfare of his county. In so far as this House is concerned, he left a mark that probably has been the cause of Governments being either taken out or put together because he was responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the Dáil bar. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis agus tá súil agam gur i suaimhneas na bhflaitheas atá sé faoi láthair.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to extend our sympathies to the Fianna Fáil Party on the death of the former Deputy, Minister and MEP, Sylvester Barrett, and also to his family who are known to me personally, in particular his brother Frank. I recall in 1977 when Sylvester Barrett was the man appointed to be the first Minister for the Environment by Jack Lynch and the many actions he took in that job, which he relished, until 1979 when he was moved to another Department following a change of leadership in Fianna Fáil, a change he did not support. Nevertheless, he continued to serve his party with loyalty and distinction and, as has already been said, he went on to represent the province of Munster in the European Parliament in 1984. At all times he was a courteous and gentle but strong and tough individual. He was very conscious of his position and very courteous to young Deputies like myself and others and very true to the Fianna Fáil Party into which he had been born, both literally and spiritually. He will be missed by many of the people who knew him here. Many of us learned with sadness of the very severe stroke he suffered which took away the quality of his life for his remaining years. I would like to extend our sympathy to his wife, his children, his extended family and the Fianna Fáil Party.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I, too, would like to join the Taoiseach and the other party leaders in offering my sympathy to Mary Barrett and to the late Sylvester Barrett's four sons and his family. Perhaps I should not admit it but, like Deputy Hogan, I was a beneficiary of his amnesty also and he always had a special place in my heart. Given the long waiting lists for driving tests on that occasion, he felt the most appropriate, effective and pragmatic decision to make was to have a general amnesty. I was not aware that any other Member of the House was a beneficiary. I would not have been so willing to admit that I was one had I known that my counterpart in the Fine Gael Party was also a beneficiary.As Deputy Quinn said, Sylvester Barrett was the first Minister for the Environment when the post was created in 1977. He went on subsequently to become Minister for Defence. He was in every sense a gentleman. He was gen uinely popular on all sides of this House. He was quiet spoken but very effective. He was also a member of another group in the early 1980s known as the Gang of 22 which, given his Clare roots and his Fianna Fáil tradition, about which Deputy Kenny spoke, took a lot of courage. He was a person of the utmost integrity. It is sad that in recent years he suffered such ill health. I am aware in particular that he enjoyed, as the Taoiseach said, the dogs, horses and sport generally. He particularly enjoyed his membership of the European Parliament and it is significant that his son is now working with the Fianna Fáil group in Europe.To the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer my sympathy but especially to his wife, Mary, his family and the people of Clare.

I extend the sympathy of the Sinn Féin team in the House to Fianna Fáil on its loss at this time. Many of the Members on the Fianna Fáil benches served with Deputy Barrett over a number of years. I did not have that pleasure and opportunity as he retired in the year I was elected to the House, but from everything I have known and heard of Deputy Barrett, he was undoubtedly, as the Taoiseach described him, and I concur with that view. I sincerely express, on behalf of myself and my party colleagues, our sympathy to his grieving widow and family in their loss.

Everyone who has spoken here today referred to his great public service and the fact that he worked extremely hard on behalf of the people of County Clare, where he engendered a great  deal of respect and love. We are all aware of his work as a Deputy, Minister and MEP. He served his constituency, county and country well. May God have mercy on his soul.

He served in this House for a long time in various capacities with great dignity, as other speakers have said. I did not have the honour of serving with him but I knew him well in Fianna Fáil.

As a young fellow, I knew Sylvie before he entered politics. He was a rate collector in my district and on many occasions he gave me a lift home from national school. He was a friend of my father and my family. He became a Deputy in 1968 and served as a Minister in a number of Departments. He is best remembered as the first Minister for the Environment in 1977, replacing the old Department of Local Government. He was a successful Minister. He was a plain, shy, genuine person and popular on all sides of the political divide. He became an MEP in 1984 and remained one until 1989. I am sure he was delighted to retire then to get away from the Brussels Eurocrats as he was very much a rural person at heart. He was delighted to return to his native parish where he concentrated on his great love of sports, particularly greyhounds and horses. One of his greatest moments of triumph was in 1995 when Clare won the all-Ireland hurling final, which he attended in Croke Park.When he became ill in December 1997, he bore his illness with great courage and dignity. It was very sad that he died during the general election campaign last month. I sympathise with his wife, Mary, and sons, Joe, Syl, Thomas and Frank, who maintains the political connection as head of the Fianna Fáil group in the European Parliament. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	149	As I indicated earlier, I am taking up Deputy Quinn's suggestion. Everyone in the country still feels sad about last Sunday's match, but 48 hours on, it gets a little better with the team's homecoming. I thank them individually and collectively for the enormous satisfaction and pride they gave to the country over the past  four weeks in their preparations for the games and their performance in the four matches. To the officials of the FAI, and particularly Mick McCarthy, the entire panel and everyone on the staff associated with the team's well-being, I give credit, and everyone in the House thanks them. They gave a huge lift to the country and, from the youngest person to the oldest, everyone was a World Cup expert.Their manner of exiting was heart-breaking, but at the same time, it gave everyone great pride in their achievements. They were not given much chance by the experts of qualifying from their group in the first place. They had to knock out either Portugal or the Netherlands which was not going to be easy, but they knocked out the Dutch, which was a huge achievement. To get through the first round after dealing with the controversy within the panel, about which much has been said, they had to steady themselves and then go into a tough group beginning with Cameroon, a team that was both African and Olympic champions. They had then to face Germany, one of the perennial great teams of the World Cup, and they got a spectacular draw. They were successful against Saudi Arabia before going on to meet Spain, still one of the fancied teams, although it did not look so great on Sunday, but that might change.I thank them all for what they have done for the country. They did the country proud. They did not get the step up that we all thought they deserved, but that is for the history books. We can celebrate today that we had a team in the World Cup that reached the second round. They were unlucky to go out. They did the country proud.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I join the Taoiseach, who is an acknowledged expert in the area of sport, in paying tribute to the Ireland team, the manager, the FAI and the supporters. They brought a sense of excitement, passion and courage to their games in the World Cup. The television shots of the supporters in the stadium after the match was a glorious personification of Ireland's personality. They also did the country proud and got us enormous credit internationally by showing the kind of people we are.On behalf of my party, I join the Taoiseach in paying due tribute to a wonderful squad, wonderful supporters and a great team management system, despite all the difficulties. The squad represented a small country against the might of international football giants, and acquitted themselves with honour, valour and credit. For that, we will never forget them.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I support the comments that have been made. In particular, I salute Mick McCarthy, the entire panel and the officials from the FAI for giving this nation a sense of joy and celebration in a manner that has brought together many people of diverse backgrounds to celebrate a sporting event. The composition of the team  and the many accents that make up its composition is an indication of how widespread the Irish nation truly is and reinforces for us the necessity to recognise that diversity. It is appropriate that some type of formal recognition be conveyed in due course, following consultation with the relevant people.I want to make one observation because I heard the Taoiseach and others speak on radio in relation to this. It is sad that the people of Dublin and of Ireland cannot celebrate the homecoming of the team on the streets of Dublin. It is also sad that the gardaí feel incapable of providing the necessary security to ensure people's safety. We saw our neighbours celebrate the Jubilee of the Head of their State recently with close to one million people out on the streets. Perhaps the new Minister for Justice and the Government could make inquiries as to why this celebration cannot be done safely, properly and joyfully on our streets as well. If it was safe for former President Clinton to address the people of Dublin from College Green and not pose a security risk, surely it would have been equally as safe for Mick McCarthy and the lads to come through the streets of Dublin rather than be obliged to go to the Phoenix Park for reasons that unfortunately reflect not too well on our collective efforts to provide security on what is a happy and joyful occasion.

It gave us all an enormous amount of pleasure in the past few weeks. We hoped it would never end. In particular, it was a great source of inspiration for young people. Notwithstanding the controversies and the difficulties at the start, Mick McCarthy showed tremendous leadership and the team remained focused on the job in hand. I know it will get an appropriate welcome this evening, but it deserves much more. Deputy Quinn made a good suggestion, which I know the Taoiseach will consider.For the future we can all look forward to that terrific group of Irish supporters from Australia, Japan and Korea whom we saw at the matches. I do not know where they all came from, but it was terrific to see the spirit in which they backed the team. Everybody who watched the matches in other countries must have been talking about the wonderful Irish fans. As Deputy Kenny said, they represented the spirit and personality of Ireland.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The Deputy should not get carried away.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	155	It is wonderful to be able to do  this. I thank Mick McCarthy and the Irish soccer team for bringing such a sense of enjoyment, pride and solidarity to people from all backgrounds who, irrespective of their political affiliations, regard themselves as Irish. From that point of view, a great feat has been achieved, even if we did not win the World Cup.It is important to reflect on the challenges the Irish team faced, to which they rose against enormous odds in the four games they played. That shows up in poor light the fact that the officials, in terms of the welcoming home celebrations, could not rise to the challenges they faced. While safety fears may be been expressed in 1990, a dozen years have passed in the meantime in which we could have come up with solutions.It would have been a great achievement, for example, to bring the Irish team by helicopter to Dublin Castle, for the squad to walk down Dame Street to College Green and to have the celebrations in the city which is crying out as the capital of the country to host these celebrations. That challenge remains for another time. It should be possible to overcome the logistical problems and to give the people of Ireland the opportunity to say thanks for what was an amazing achievement.

It is important that we note and record in this House that this is a team which was not beaten on the field of play in all the games it played. That is a particularly important achievement and one that deserves recognition.We recognise the team's tenacity, which was strong, prevalent and very much in evidence in all the games it played. It united almost all opinion throughout the land behind it. That was apparent on each day the games were played. The island as a whole almost came to a standstill. The team has done us all proud and is deserving of the celebratory nature of its welcome home to Ireland this evening.Like Deputies Quinn and Sargent, I also wish, in a constructive tone, to encourage a visitation of the difficulties that have been referred to as leading to the almost herding of the welcome home event out to the Phoenix Park. The city of Dublin, the capital of Ireland, and its centre city area was the appropriate location for this welcome home, one that would have accorded the opportunity for a great deal more people to see firsthand the returning Irish team. That is something that needs to be addressed. I hope the situation we will see this evening will not be repeated on future occasions. I have no doubt the Taoiseach will take on board the sentiments of the nation as expressed on the airwaves in the past 48 hours.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 1, motion re election of Leas-Cheann Comhairle; No. 2, motion re restoration of Bills to the Order Paper; and, subject to the agreement of No. 2, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that all divisions demanded in the House this week shall be taken manually and Nos. 1 and 2 shall be decided without debate. Private Members' Business shall be No 5, motion re programme for Government.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	158	There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal that all divisions demanded in the House this week shall be taken manually agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1, motion re Election of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and No. 2, motion re Restoration of Bills to the Order Paper, agreed ? Agreed.We will now move on to Leaders' Questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	159	In keeping with the theme of the arrival of the Irish team back home today, will the Taoiseach clarify whether, in the words of another, a seismic shift has been brought about in Government policy by the Minister for Justice? Will he clarify if a decision has been taken to move the proposed stadium from Abbotstown to Ringsend? There has been great media speculation about this. This is obviously important for the team arriving here this evening. The younger members of the squad might be able to play there in the European Championships. Will the Taoiseach clarify whether a decision has been made to move from Abbotstown to Ringsend and when can we expect an announcement on that?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Could the Taoiseach indicate when the Government will publish the interim report outlining what the options are since according to the programme for Government Abbotstown is no longer on the agenda? Has the Government decided in principle on a smaller scale national stadium than the 80,000 seater stadium originally proposed? Will he also state whether the stadium will be completed in time to host the European Cup championships in 2008?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The first decision made is that we will build a world class stadium and I will be pleased with that. Many views have been put forward about where the stadium should be. My view, that we need a national stadium, is well known. We have agreed in the programme for Government that there will be communication between the CSID board, the national sporting bodies and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, about the precise size of the stadium. The size of the stadium should be agreed by these bodies, particularly those who will use the stadium. That matter will be finalised in a matter of  weeks and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, will bring the matter to Cabinet for the final decision. Hopefully the stadium will be built in time for the European Cup in 2008.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I am slightly confused with the Taoiseach's reference to a national stadium and to a world class stadium. It appears to me that he is consistent in his own view and that there is no change in the provision of a national stadium and the world class stadium and that it will be in Abbotstown. Will the Taoiseach confirm that is the position as of today and that it is still on course and will be built in Abbotstown?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	163	To clarify so that there is no doubt, we are going to build a world class stadium. As soon as the deliberations are over it will be decided where. The fact is that the Abbotstown site is in the hands of the State. People have put other options and some of the national sporting bodies have put forward views. The Minister will take all of this into account before reporting back and the decision is made. I remain consistent in my word that the national sporting bodies and the CSID board which has worked hard on this over the last number of years should be able to express their views to the new Minister. Then the options will go forward and the decision will be made by the Cabinet.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	164	On 6 May Fianna Fáil, in its manifesto, pledged to eliminate and permanently end waiting lists in our hospitals within two years through a combination of bed capacity, primary care, secondary care and targeted reform initiatives. Yet, in the programme for Government published subsequent to the outcome of the election, the same commitment that was made so clearly and prominently was watered down to the following: "we will treat people within new national guidelines for maximum waiting times set out in the national health strategy."  What happened between 6 May and the publication of the national programme that resulted in the reneging by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on that commitment to eliminate hospital waiting lists within two years?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Are the strategies outlined and the fora that have been held intended to come together to provide a "world class" health service which we do not have at the moment?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The programme for Government reflects what has been agreed by all the stakeholders in the health service. We can dramatically improve the waiting lists and aim to get everybody seen within three months. We will continue to build on what has been specified in the national health strategy and to resource that is the number one area of priority in the life of this Government. We have built on that and in certain areas targeted by the last Government we  have reduced the waiting list to one month in some cases. It is a challenge to get the list down to three months in other specialities and areas. The effort of this Government will be to follow what is in the national health strategy and we will try to achieve our targets across all aspects of health.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I have the Taoiseach's waffly reply. Why did he renege on his promise to eliminate waiting lists within two years?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	168	We have already this year put 709 extra beds into the system to try to deal with the issues. We have also appointed extra accident and emergency consultants and an enormous number of staff. That is all designed to reduce waiting lists to as short a period of time as we can. That is in line with the national health strategy.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	169	That concludes leaders' questions.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Will the Taoiseach clarify an announcement he made today in relation to the various appointments he has made? On 6 June Deputy D. Ahern was announced as Minister for Communications and Natural Resources. Following pressure from the marine sector the Taoiseach has decided to return the marine portfolio to the Cabinet table.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	171	That does not arise from the Order of Business. It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	172	May I finish? Today Deputy D. Ahern has been announced as the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources. Does that mean that communications are no longer at the Cabinet table?

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Today Parents for Justice expressed alarm at the fact that the Minister for Health has not defined the shape of the public inquiry on organ retention. It does require a statutory basis because he has made this commitment. When can we expect the legislation required to set up this public inquiry on organ retention? The Minister for Health and Children promised that he would bring in a human tissue Bill to deal with the issue. Will the Taoiseach indicate when that Bill might be published?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	175	If legislation is required in that area the Minister will have to announce it. I suggest the Deputy should put down a question to the Minister asking him to clarify what he will do in the area.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	176	No legislation is promised.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The Parents for Justice were promised at a meeting on 17 April that there would a statutory basis to a public inquiry on organ retention. They were informed at the time that it would be only a matter of weeks before the definition became public.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	178	It was not promised in this Dáil.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	179	There are many of those interested in the maritime sector in mourning at the Government's downgrading of that Department. In relation to the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000, will the Title of this Bill cause further mourning? Surely the Bill should be called the Prevention of Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill. Whatever it is called, it will be before the House before the MOX shipments come down the Irish Sea. If there was any accident it would be an awful dumping at sea incident. Will that Bill be before the House this term?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Legislation has just been reinstated so it will come back into the House.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	181	When will that be?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	182	As soon as possible.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Is it intended to circulate the Nice Treaty Referendum (Amendment) Bill and is it intended to take it early in this session?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Hopefully it will be circulated next week. We can then have a discussion about when it should be taken.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I welcome the appointment of two of my constituency colleagues to positions with responsibility for disability, Deputy O'Dea in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Deputy O'Malley in the Department of Health and Children. However, the last disabilities Bill brought forward by this Government had to be ignominiously dumped. I am concerned that the senior Minister was consistently referred to as the Minister for Justice on the first day of this Dáil, including by his party leader, and I wonder about his concern for equality issues. What plans does the Government have to introduce a disabilities Bill which will give enforceable rights to people with disabilities?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	186	There will have to be legislation. We agreed that there would be a consultation process. That is currently in progress and no Bill will be brought forward until that process is complete.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	187	During the five years of the last Dáil the Government failed to curb the greed of private landlords who exploited their tenants outrageously, by raising rents and sometimes by providing sub-standard accommodation.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Has the Deputy a question on legislation that is appropriate to the Order of Business?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	189	When will there be legislation arising from the report of the commission on the private rented sector? Second, there is a promise to consider legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of apartment complex management companies. When will that legislation be brought forward?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The heads of the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill were approved a number of months ago and the legislation is being drafted. I am not sure what stage it is at but the legislation was given priority for drafting.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	191	What about my second question regarding a Bill to regulate the establishment and operation of apartment complex management companies which the Government promised to consider?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I do not think there is a specific Bill for that. If there is, I will inform the Deputy.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	193	When will we have a Bill? It is in the programme for Government.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	194	If there is no Bill promised, the Deputy can put down a parliamentary question on the matter.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	195	So it is just there to fill up space.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Although a number of Bills from the last Dáil have been restored to the Order Paper, when does the Taoiseach expect to publish a legislative programme for the current Dáil? Will it be before or after the recess? It would resolve many of the queries being raised today.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	197	We usually publish a legislative programme at the start of the new session so it will be published in September rather than now.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	198	We have restored a number of Bills to the Order Paper. One of them is the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, a Bill that was roundly criticised by a cross section of public opinion, including the Human Rights Commission established by the House.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I remind the Deputy that the Bills to which he referred have not yet been restored to the Order Paper. That will happen later.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	200	It is intended to restore them to the Order Paper by regulation. With regard to the Bill I mentioned, will the Bill as published be proceeded with or will a Bill to provide for a proper transposition of the European convention into Irish law, as recommended by the president  of the Human Rights Commission, be brought before the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The Minister will have to give consideration to whether changes or amendments should be made to the Bill. The Bill concerned is the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001 and amendments to it are a matter for the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	17992	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The Taoiseach will have read in the financial returns that spending is running at twice the projected level while tax revenue is only one eighth of the growth that was projected. Will a mini budget or Supplementary Estimates be presented to the House in view of the collapse in the Government's financial projections for the year?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	203	There is no mini budget.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I have two questions for the Taoiseach on promised legislation. The Labour Party's Private Members' Bill, the European Union Bill, is due to be restored to the Order Paper later today. This Bill was accepted by the Government last year. When is it intended to deal with this Bill, as it is central to ensuring a successful outcome to a second referendum on the Nice treaty? My second question relates to necessary, if not promised, legislation on housing. There is a category of private tenants covered by the 1982 landlord and tenant legislation which expires this July. As a result, these tenants will lose all legal protections. These people were previously covered by the controlled tenants legislation that was overturned by the Supreme Court. Representations have been made to the relevant Department. Is there any proposal to introduce temporary legislation, before the end of this parliamentary session, to extend the operation of this legislation to give protection to the approximately 800 people who will lose all security of tenure?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The European Union Bill is a Private Members' Bill. It was agreed by the last Dáil to take on board a certain amount of that Bill. Deputy Quinn has pointed out that other aspects of the Bill should also be taken on board. I will ask the Minister to look at this. He had previously agreed to accept some of the suggestions and recommendation of the Bill so I will ask him to look again at the up to date position in that regard. The Bill, however, is a Private Members' Bill.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	206	We are happy to let the Government run with it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Some parts of it create difficulties but other parts contain good suggestions which we have taken on board—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	—to improve the scrutiny of the House and the legislative process. I do not disagree with the outline contained in the Bill but some aspects of it are not easily used. Others are, however, and these were accepted by the last Government. They are to come into effect, if I remember correctly, from 1 July, subject to discussion.With regard to the second question, I am not aware of what action is necessary in that area. However, I am aware of the cases in the controlled rented sector mentioned by the Deputy. I will seek a note on it. There was some discussion of it by the previous Minister—
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	210	There will be summary evictions during the summer.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	211	—but I will get a note from the new Minister and let the Deputy know the position.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."It seems to me to be appropriate that we are considering a major financial services regulation Bill this year – the 60th anniversary of the passage of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which established the Central Bank of Ireland. Let me hasten to add that in the intervening years there have been several major Acts bearing on the banking and financial services sector and on the Central Bank's functions.The world in which the Central Bank of Ireland operates has changed enormously since 1942. The Deputies of that time would not recognise the modern Irish financial industry. At the end of December, 2001 there were 55 holders of banking licences and 32 branches of EU banks operating in this country. These include the most important financial institutions in the world. In addition to the banks, there are literally thousands of investment firms and financial and investment intermediaries supervised by the Central Bank which the Oireachtas established 60 years ago. Outside the realm of current Central Bank supervision there are insurance companies, credit unions and so forth, adding to the complexity and sophistication of the financial services industry. The financial services industry plays a major role in the economy, as it provides direct employment to about 50,000 people and supplies a wide range of services and products that are vital in a modern economy. As this industry has changed and grown over the years, there have been considerable changes in the legal and regulatory framework.I pay tribute to the unseen and largely unknown guardians of the public interest in the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. It is a tribute to their effectiveness that they are so rarely in the public eye. Failure of a financial institution has been a rare event in this country, although it is important that Deputies are aware that high standards of regulation do not provide an absolute assurance that difficulties will not arise in individual financial institutions. High quality regulation seeks to minimise the risk of serious problems in individual firms and, more widely, in the financial sector, while maintaining a climate in which the industry can continue to innovate and develop.The main purposes of this Bill are to provide for the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority – IFSRA – within the overall new structure of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland; to assign functions to the IFSRA as the single regulator for the financial services sector, thereby providing a one stop shop by having the regulation of insurance, banking and credit unions under one roof; to strengthen the consumer focus of regulation by giving the authority specific responsibilities in this regard and creating a statutory position of consumer director; and to establish the financial services appeals tribunal.In this Bill I seek to improve on the solid foundation that exists in relation to the State's oversight of financial services. I wish to respond to the demand for a better service for consumers of financial services and greater accountability by financial institutions and the new regulatory authorities. A key objective of the Bill is to give a strong mandate to the regulatory authority with regard to the regulation of the conduct of financial services business while also providing a stronger framework for regulating the manner in which financial institutions deal with their customers – so-called "conduct of business" regulation – and also on consumer protection. While talking about protecting consumers of financial services, we should not forget that the most basic protection sought by consumers is a reasonable assurance that the institution to which they entrust their money is financially sound and that the financial system of which it is a part is fundamentally solid.A second objective of the Bill is to redesign the structure of regulation to reflect changes in the market and the legislation governing it which have taken place during the last ten years. As different sectors of the wider financial services increasingly offer similar products, it makes sense that they be regulated by a single institution. It makes sense, especially for a small country like Ireland, that we make best use of the necessarily limited pool of regulatory expertise at our disposal. This approach has wide-ranging support and its case has been made by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. It has been accepted by Government and it has been reviewed and approved by the McDowell group.I wish to take this opportunity to point out another advantage of the integration of financial services regulation. Not only is there increased integration of financial services within Ireland, but there is increased integration of financial services internationally, which leads to consolidation of services centres, administration, asset management and dealing activities. We compete internationally to be the location for such activities and one of the major factors in determining where such centres are located is the reputation and expertise of the regulator. I expect that a single integrated regulator and continued high standards will be positive elements in the context of attracting such investment to Ireland. These argu ments support the integration of prudential, consumer and conduct of business regulation for all sectors of financial services providers under one regulator.Deputies are aware that the McDowell group recommended that the single regulatory authority should be an entirely new independent organisation. After long deliberation and discussion, I present in this Bill an arrangement which has been approved by the Government and which is fully in the spirit of the McDowell report. It accommodates the different views of the minority on the group in relation to the ideal structure for regulation of financial services in Ireland. The structure provided for in the Bill differs somewhat from the structure announced by the Government in February 2001. It provides for a monetary committee of the board, rather than a separate monetary authority, within the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. Following informal discussions with ECB officials last year, it was deemed desirable to make clear that there is no attempt to circumvent the institutional independence of the Central Bank or the Governor in carrying out European System of Central Banks related tasks. It has been agreed that the Governor will have a more direct role in relation to the budget and regulatory activities of the IFSRA to ensure that financial stability issues and ESCB tasks are dealt with in a co-ordinated fashion.The establishment of a new entity, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, as a constituent part of a new bank structure is at the heart of this Bill's proposals. The authority will manage the regulation of financial institutions in Ireland. The IFSRA will take on and develop the financial services supervisory functions of the bank, as well as handling the regulation of credit unions and the insurance sector. The regulatory authority is to be established under section 33B of the principal Act and will operate as a constituent part of the new bank. It will have its own chairperson, chief executive and consumer director and will have independent functions. The chairperson, chief executive and some authority members will also be members of the board of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. The post of consumer director is specifically provided for in the Bill and a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions is also provided for, in recognition of the unique role played by credit unions in Irish society.The regulatory authority will have two main sets of functions. It will be responsible for the licensing and prudential regulation of all financial services providers and for consumer protection across the sectors. It will consist of a chairperson, the chief executive, the consumer director and no fewer than six and no more than eight persons appointed by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The chairperson of the authority will be appointed by the Minister for Finance. Deputies will be aware I appointed an  interim board, on a non-statutory basis, on 16 April 2002. The chairperson of the interim board is Mr. Brian Patterson. The role of the interim board will include selecting a chief executive for the IFSRA and assisting the chief executive-designate, the Ministers and the Central Bank in preparing for the establishment of the IFSRA. The appointment of the interim board will help ensure that a smooth transition to the new regulatory arrangements takes place as soon as possible.A steering committee and a support group have been established, drawn from officials of the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department, to ensure that the chairperson and the interim board are assisted and supported to enable them to perform the tasks which the interim board was set up to do. I intend that the interim board will become the regulatory authority once it has been established under this legislation. It is essential that the regulatory authority is properly and adequately funded if it is to exercise fully its powers and functions. The McDowell group considered this issue and favoured funding by the industry. Accordingly, the Bill gives the chief executive of the authority, with the agreement of the authority, power to make regulations to impose levies. These regulations only come into effect, however, if they have been approved by the Minister for Finance. If the funds raised from the fees and levies imposed prove inadequate for the authority to perform its functions, the bank may provide the authority with funds to meet a shortfall.Consumer protection is a vital issue. The McDowell group gave detailed consideration to the questions of prudential regulation and consumer protection. It recommended that the single regulatory authority – SRA – be given statutory responsibility for prudential regulation and for consumer issues relating to financial institutions. The group also recommended that responsibility for approval of bank charges be transferred to the SRA and that a statutory position of consumer protection director be established within the SRA.It is intended that the consumer director will have a leading role in the exercise by the IFSRA of the consumer functions transferring from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The provisions contained in the Bill reflect this intention, particularly the requirement that the consumer director will be on the regulatory authority. The responsibilities of the consumer director are provided for in the Bill. In essence, they are to monitor the provision of financial services to consumers and to exercise important consumer protection powers under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, and other legislation relating to the Central Bank and the insurance industry. The Bill also sets the reporting arrangements, etc, of the consumer director. In this regard, I draw the attention of  Deputies to section 33V(6) of the Bill which provides that the consumer director can report directly to the regulatory authority on any matter.I would now like to deal with the post of Registrar of Credit Unions. At the moment the Registrar of Friendly Societies has responsibility, inter alia, for the general regulation and financial supervision of credit unions. The McDowell group recognised the valuable contribution and the unique role of credit unions in society, with which I fully agree. The credit union movement is characterised by a large number of quite small, community-based credit unions providing fairly limited services to their members. However, some have grown into quite large operations which are now significant providers of services of a financial nature.The McDowell group considered that all financial service providers should, in principle, be dealt with by a single regulatory authority, and that a compelling case would have to be made for the exclusion of any provider from its remit. In regard to the credit unions, the group recommended that the approach which would best address the unique characteristics of the credit union movement would be to have the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies in relation to credit unions brought into the single regulatory authority. The group considered that this should be done in a manner that would recognise and be supportive of the uniqueness of credit unions and also give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of a single regulatory authority while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise. The McDowell group recommended that these concerns should be addressed by the establishment of a statutory position of credit unions within the single regulatory authority. The Bill provides for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report.I would now like to turn to another significant element of the package of recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The group agreed that where functions are being transferred to the single regulatory authority, relevant enforcement powers which relate to those functions should also be vested in the authority. The group considered that the ability of the single regulatory authority to regulate any financial market without it being able to impose civil sanction to enforce the same would result in ineffective regulation.The group recommended that, in the first instance, the single regulatory authority should have power to impose sanctions on a financial services provider for breach of the relevant regulatory code. The group also identified a need to set up an appeals system for financial institutions which wished to appeal against the imposition of such sanctions. The group recommended that the tribunal should be established at the outset of the new regulatory arrangements and that this should be facilitated by the inclusion of the necessary  provisions for the establishment of the tribunal in the legislation providing for the establishment of the SRA. Accordingly, the Bill contains provisions for the establishment and operation of the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. The Bill provides also for procedures for hearing and determining appeals, for references and appeals to the High Court and for other miscellaneous matters relating to the tribunal.I would now like to turn to staffing. It is intended that IFSRA will draw most of its initial staff from the regulatory departments of the Central Bank, which account for the great majority of the people currently engaged in supervision. Staff will also be drawn from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the offices of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The Bill includes provision for the permanent transfer of those staff, subject to their agreement, to the new authority. All the staff of the entity, whether working in IFSRA or elsewhere, will be employees of the re-organised bank, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland CBFSAI. At the same time the board is required, with the agreement of the chief executive of the regulatory authority, to arrange for employees of the bank to be assigned to the regulatory authority and to any divisions, branches or offices of the bank.The Bill also provides for the mobility of staff, both existing and newly appointed, within the CBFSAI. The board of the CBFSAI is required to establish and operate a policy under which provision is made for employees of the CBFSAI to be given opportunities for training and experience in the various activities, and in the different constituent parts, of the overall organisation. These provisions should ensure that the regulatory authority will operate effectively and efficiently from the outset.The broad structure of the Bill is as follows. Part I on page 5 of the Bill as initiated contains a Short Title and provisions for the commencement of the Act. Part II, which commences on page 5, provides for the amendment of the Central Bank Act, 1942 for the purposes of re-organising and renaming the Central Bank of Ireland. This part, in addition to amending and repealing the text of the 1942 Act, as appropriate, inserts additional parts and schedules into the 1942 Act.The provisions relating to the IFSRA are set out in a new Part IIIA of the 1942 Act, to be inserted by section 27 of the Bill on page 26. Chapter 1 of this new part provides for the constitution, functions and powers of the authority. Chapter 2, which commences on page 38, provides for the establishment of the statutory position of Consumer Director and Chapter 3, on page 44, provides for the appointment of the Registrar of Credit Unions.A new Part IIIB of the 1942 Act contains certain provisions relating to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and its constituent parts. Part VIIA of the 1942 Act, as  inserted by section 29 of the Bill on page 60, is divided into five chapters and deals with the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. Section 30 on page 86 inserts a new Part VIIIA into the 1942 Act and sets out the provisions for making regulations and orders under the 1942 Act. As I said earlier, Part II of the Bill amends the 1942 Act by amending and inserting additional schedules. There are also three Schedules to the Bill.Before concluding, I would like to refer to a number of procedural matters. Under European law, the Government is required to consult the European Central Bank on legislation of this type. Once this Bill was published, the ECB was formally consulted. It welcomed the proposed structure, while making some detailed comments on it. These will be examined before Committee Stage but I do not consider that any fundamental issues in relation to the new arrangements arise from the ECB views. It is my intention to lay the opinion of the ECB before both Houses, subject to any confidentiality issues, after the Government has considered the matter and before consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage. I will be bringing forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. Some are technical and others arise from the ongoing consideration of this complex legislation. I will give Deputies details of these amendments in advance of Committee Stage and my officials will be available to brief Deputies on them if they so wish.As Deputies will be aware, the McDowell report contained a package of recommendations in regard to financial regulation. This Bill deals mainly with the establishment of IFSRA. I intend to publish a second Bill later this year to implement the remainder of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The main provisions to be included in the second Bill are to establish a statutory financial services ombudsman; establish consultative panels of the financial services industry and of consumers; address issues arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on auditing; and make provisions arising from a review of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 dealing with confidentiality of Central Bank information.I must stress, therefore, that this Bill is, first, concerned essentially with structures and, second, is part of a package of measures rather than stand-alone legislation. As regards the basic structures for regulation, I am confident that the new structure provided for in this Bill gives us the best of all worlds. On the one hand, there is a new regulatory authority, IFSRA, with a clear consumer mandate and on the other there is an organic linkage to the authority responsible for stability and monetary issues. There is also a structure in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland which facilitates efficient use of resources and mobility of staff. The Bill also provides for clear accountability, both within the new structure and to the Oireachtas.The measures incorporated in this Bill and the proposed second Bill will together lead to more efficient regulation, with a stronger consumer focus than heretofore. I commend the Bill to the House.

I enjoyed your rulings as Ceann Comhairle and look forward to equally enjoying them in your position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.I move amendment No. 1:
To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:"Dáil Éireann declines to give the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, a Second Reading for at least three months until(a) a full assessment of best practice in regulatory supervision has been undertaken, which takes into account the lessons of recent regulatory failures (including the lessons of Enron and Allfirst); and(b) a full assessment of best practice in providing consumer protection in relation to financial services has been undertaken;and the proposed merger of consumer protection and prudential regulation into a single Regulatory Agency can be viewed against best practice requirements identified by those assessments".The reason I am doing this is that essentially the Bill has come from very whimsical origins. The decision to merge consumer protection and prudential regulation has not been justified in the documentation by any Minister. It was not justified adequately by the group chaired by Mr. McDowell. It was opposed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service when it reported on the issue in July 1998. There was no significant analysis of any merit as to whether merging consumer protection with prudential regulation would improve either of those functions.The Government decided four years ago, in October 1998, that in principle it would establish a single regulatory authority for the supervision of financial services. Many people would welcome that if what it involved was simply moving the supervision of insurance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to a new regulatory authority. It was quite clear that the Department was not at the world's cutting edge in relation to supervision and no one would have suggested that the idea was not a good one. Equally, everyone realised that the Central Bank was not the receptacle for consumer protection. It had and continues to have a poor record and it has clear conflicts in respect of the objectives  which it pursues and the objective of consumer protection.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	17992	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	262	There was no proper attempt to deal with this issue and when the Government decision was made, the McDowell group was set up to implement it. The group never went back to first principles to ask whether merging consumer protection and prudential regulation was a good thing, it solely dealt with the implementation. In fact the word "implementation" was in the advisory group's name. It did not have a mandate to look at this. An ill thought out decision made in 1998 prejudiced the whole debate that evolved. The result has been that the McDowell group did not look at first principles to see whether we have a good regulatory regime. It did not look to see if we have best practice in relation to consumer protection in financial services and we see the product of that in today's Bill. It is a massive bulldog clip put around the existing regulatory functions and transferred holus bolus to this new authority. There was no discernment or assessment as to whether those functions were up to speed and that is why I say we should not go ahead with this until we do that very important work.If the importance of finding out if we have best practice needed underlining, Enron and Allfirst provide ample evidence. I hope the Minister will accept that we have not had the sort of debate we need to go ahead with this. The advisory group was holed below the waterline before it started its work and the really important questions were ducked because the Government had already made its mind up on these issues. That is not a criticism of Deputy McDowell and his group.This decision also spawned a very barren turf war which the Minister knows all about. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment sought to remove the regulatory authority from the Central Bank, no doubt motivated by its record of little enough interest in consumer protection. Furthermore, the Central Bank was very pleased, as the Oireachtas committee report suggested, to move consumer protection to a dedicated independent directorate of consumer affairs. I recall, as will Deputy Rabbitte, that the Central Bank agreed, in respect of consumer credit, that all the functions it previously had would be given to the Director of Consumer Affairs. It recognised that it had not been and did not see itself as primarily a consumer protection body. For the past 20 years public policy has been to go in the opposite direction and that has been endorsed by several policy initiatives, but no apparent justification was offered by the Minister today as to why he is reversing that position. I did not see it in his speech, which was totally devoid of any argument as to why we ought to be pleased with the Bill being presented to us. In this barren turf war quite clearly the Department of Finance and the Central Bank won out and the consumer  lost. The consumer has lost out in this debate and anyone who championed the consumer interest will see this as a defeat. I agree with them. The Central Bank has a poor record in dealing with consumer protection issues and it has now absorbed these responsibilities from the independent and fearless Director of Consumer Affairs, who has rattled many cages over the years, unlike the bank which does not see itself as having that role.Probably the greatest defeat to consumers came with the earlier decision of the Government that it would merge consumer protection with prudential regulation, which has very different objectives. We have simply brought together in one place all of these regulatory provisions, none of which has been vetted or scrutinised to see if it is good. There is ample evidence that consumer protection regulations and legislation are not up to speed. Transparency of information about financial products is poor and we do not have good legislation in that area. Undoubtedly, the Director of Consumer Affairs has begun to get to grips with that, but we are clearly a long way from best practice. Opportunities for consumers to shop around are easily and openly curtailed. Very rarely when one's insurance is coming up for renewal does one get advance notice that gives time to shop around and there is actually a conspiracy to prevent people from doing that, which could be addressed through legislation. There is clearly no vigorous competition within many sections of the financial services industry and Deputy Rabbitte earlier spoke about the insurance industry which is one element that is being brought into this. It is obvious that consumer interests are not being adequately protected.I notice that the advisory group made the interesting observation that one of the roles the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment saw itself as having related to cost competitiveness. It believed in bringing down the cost of insurance. None of the other agencies, one being the Central Bank, has ever seen competitiveness as being part of its core mandate. The bank has simply been interested in solvency and by the merger of consumer interest with the regulatory authority we are losing this strong thrust in the Department in the direction of vigorous competition. Many cosy practices are being tolerated in the insurance industry that should not be and there is much for it to clean up. The cost of key financial services is much higher here than in other countries. The interest rates spread is much higher and profits in the banking sector are double the return on capital afforded in other countries. Very clearly, the Central Bank has had an approach to competitiveness issues that is not sympathetic to consumers or users of financial services, but these issues are being entrusted to it.There is real conflict here. Prudential interests demand that the security of an institution is protected by large profit margins and they are not  too fussy about tax issues or consumer interests as we have seen in the past. This Bill does not address tax issues, which I thought it would. Consumer protection interests are very different. They want to see lower profit margins, high efficiency, very contestable markets with lots of turnover and much activity. Very different objectives are being pursued by the two bodies the Minister is trying to thrust together and there is a conflict of interest. This is not bogus, which even the Central Bank would recognise. I would have expected the McDowell group to find out if the merging of consumer protection with regulatory provision was best practice. There is an appendix to its report which reviews what happens in other countries and it is staggering. The group came up with evidence that in 16 of 19 countries looked at no significant element of consumer protection law was given to the authority responsible for prudential regulation. The other three countries provided for a small element of consumer protection in that way, but none of the 19 has adopted the model the Minister is proposing today. The committee recommended against the approach taken in this legislation a few months prior to the Government decision.I refer to prudential supervision. It is not advisable to proceed quickly with the passage of the legislation, which is the Minister's intention, without first asking whether our regulatory system is up to world best practice. The advisory group and the authors of this Bill are not totally silent on this issue. It is again assumed that by simply relocating some powers to a new institution, best practice is achieved. Such faith is not well placed and I gravely doubt that is the case.There is no doubt the performance of regulators, auditors and internal controls has suffered a seismic shock in recent months and I am amazed that we are pushing forward with this legislation without examining the reports of the experts evaluating the various collapses in supervision that occurred. I will not be surprised if these reports recommend changes in our regulatory regime. Why should we push ahead with this legislation until the reports on Enron and Allfirst, for example, have been examined? The Central Bank of Ireland and the Federal Reserve in the US are both examining the Allfirst case, but the Government is intent on proceeding with this Bill regardless. New risks have not been considered. The Central Bank even conducted stress tests recently to ascertain whether contagion could catch on. While the bank has provided a little reassurance, it has also said it cannot be certain the procedures in place make it robust against new risks. The recommendations of the groups that are examining recent financial collapses should be awaited before proceeding with legislation.The advisory group offered flimsy arguments as to why consumer protection and regulation should be merged. One argument was that it would facilitate the transfer of information. The Minister plans to amend the legislation relating  to the transfer of information and that issue could have been overcome by amending existing legislation but it has not been considered as an option.The second argument offered by the McDowell group was that it would be nice to have a one-stop-shop. That is great provided one is not trying to merge high grade surgery with the sale of nuts and bolts, which is what is being attempted. The Minister is trying to merge two areas that are incompatible. Creating a one-stop-shop would be valid only if there was genuine synergy between the two tasks that are undertaken. Such synergy does not exist and others share my view in that regard. Professor Kinsella, a colleague of the Minister, has argued trenchantly that there is no such synergy. There are conflicting regulatory objectives between consumer and prudential protection; limited synergy in terms of the skills that are needed; moral hazards and impediments; and different timescales to which both work. He made a persuasive case that the merger of regulation with consumer protection damages both and does not enhance them. That argument should be assessed in a manner that has not occurred to date.An attempt was made when these financial authorities were structured to give responsibility for different functions that were incompatible to one institution and that has resulted in the enormous complexity of the structure before us. It bears all the hallmarks of a cobbled together compromise resulting from a policy that was ill-thought out in the first place. The Central Bank succeeded in scuppering the concept of a stand alone regulatory authority, separate from the bank, but instead there will be an authority which will be a subsidiary of the bank. This structure is uneasy and the delegated authority to the financial regulator is not entirely clear. It must act with an eye continually over its shoulder as to the views of the Central Bank and an uneasy compromise is contained in the sections relating to how the structure will work.There is also evidence of incompatible elements being forced together within the subsidiary. A makeshift firewall is being constructed to prevent the consumer interest being overwhelmed by prudential concerns. The firewall will take the form of the appointment of a consumer director, who will be a member of board of the authority. However, this again is an effort to compensate for something that the Minister, in his heart, knows will go wrong. He is trying to create a counterbalance in this regard.I am not entirely happy with the provisions relating to accountability to the House. For example, the Committee of Public Accounts will not have a say in regard to the role of the regulator and the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit will not be extended to cover the office. Oireachtas committees will be able to summon the regulator to appear before them but there should be more stringent accountability to the  Dáil. The traditional independence of the Central Bank means that it should be more accountable.When I approached the legislation initially I had certain ideas about what it would contain. It was extremely difficult to make sense of it and before I read it I jotted down what I thought the Minister would try to achieve in it. I was amazed when I re-examined the list I made how few of the issues in it had been addressed. The first issue I noted was that the Bill would deal with the perception that tax compliance has not been properly overseen in the context of regulation. There is no reference in the legislation to improved oversight of tax compliance in terms of regulatory functions. I thought it would address the belief that competitiveness concerns have unnecessarily succumbed to prudential interests. To the contrary, the legislation will further erode the belief that competitiveness will be a major concern of the regulatory authorities. The Bill, in dealing with the belief that consumer protection is a poor relation in terms of Central Bank supervision, has made the position worse because the solution to the turf war is that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has lost out to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in this area.The legislation places similar supervisory requirements on all regulatory bodies, which I commend. It is correct that brokers, tied agents, banks, credit unions, building societies, insurance agents and so on should be supervised on a level playing pitch and that has been achieved. However, I thought the most important issue the legislation would address was the sense that many of our scattered regulatory bodies were not up to best practice and that issue has been entirely ignored by the Minister. We do not know if best practice is observed and there are considerable reasons to believe it is not.I am also amazed that when a Bill of such density and depth is introduced, the issues that would have made a difference to consumers and business have been omitted. The Minister intends to address them later in the year. Why not address these issues now if they are to be at the heart of an authority that will be responsive to consumer and business interests and give them a say under the new structure? Why are these issues being deferred until after the horse has bolted? It also has been brought to my attention that this legislation means that we are marching to a very different drum to the rest of Europe. No other country in Europe has sought to merge consumer protection with prudential regulation. I understand that the Minister has proposed at ECOFIN that there should be a single European regulatory authority. If that is so, what is the future for this legislation if in time we move to a single regulatory authority in Europe which will have no consumer protection role?

This Bill has been put before the House without proper thought being given to it. The attempt to merge two functions that are really quite different has resulted in the loss of key elements of good governance – simplicity, transparency and accountability. It has numerous interlocking and overlapping structures that give neither simplicity, transparency nor accountability. We will live to regret that we took this road and we will spend some time unpicking this omelette. We will wonder what happened to consumer protection and why we ever thought that consumer protection would be adequately dealt with in an authority whose primary concern is with solvency. Consumer protection will be sacrificed on the  altar of solvency if a choice has to be made. The issue of solvency and regulatory control will of necessity be foremost in their minds. I am unhappy with this Bill and I will not be supporting it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The Bill arises from a decision taken in principle by the Government on 20 October 1998 to establish a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector "at the earliest possible date."  That is now almost four years ago and to some extent it highlights the difficulty and tardiness in implementing a decision taken by Government. It is relevant to Deputy Bruton's amendment which seeks to delay the conclusion of Second Stage of the Bill for three months for the reasons which he has eloquently argued at the outset of his contribution. We have already waited four years so I do not think it would be unreasonable to have the examination conducted as Deputy Bruton argues.The events at Allfirst and Enron have been unprecedented shocks to the system. A system of regulation cannot prevent what happened in the case of Allfirst because when somebody is dedicated to fraud that will happen; however it seems to the layman that it could have been picked up earlier. I am always bemused by the attention to duty in some cases by members of the Minister's profession in their capacity as auditors. I have always found it amazing that accounts can be signed off when there is a hole beneath the water line. My party will support the amendment that we provide time to assess whether we are following best practice in making this decision in this Bill.The background to the Government decision of 20 October 1998 was the unprecedented public outcry at the time due to a number of events that had taken place and the perception that the Central Bank in particular and the regulatory authorities generally were not concerned so much with consumer protection as with prudential supervision. That is manifestly the case and the Central Bank does not argue that it is otherwise. There were a number of examples to show that consumer protection did not feature as a priority within the Central Bank. That conviction has been highlighted by the widespread public perception that the financial institutions have unjustifiably high profits within this jurisdiction, have imposed unconscionably high charges and levy interest rates that are frequently higher than elsewhere in the OECD countries. At the same time the marketplace is not characterised by vigorous competition in the sector. The view abroad is that there was a relatively cosy arrangement for a long time between the banks and financial institutions and the ordinary high street consumer was paying the price. When the events happened, the Government made this decision. I do not know how much thought went into the Government decision of 20 October 1998. There is no argument in the Minister's script to explain the ration ale that led to that decision; he merely takes it as a given.The McDowell report was given its riding instructions and there is a view in some quarters that the McDowell group actually came up with the notion of a single financial regulatory authority that would fuse both the consumer and the prudential requirements. That is not the case, of course, and I do not think I am doing Deputy McDowell any injustice when I say that the instruction they received was to implement the Government decision and not to examine whether or not it was a good idea.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The point was made repeatedly in replies to parliamentary questions, time after time, that the job of the McDowell group was implementation of the Government decision but I might as well have been beating my head against a stone wall. Very few Deputies and few outside commentators listened to that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	276	That may well be so, though I do not know if that amounts to an apologia for introducing the Bill in this shape. If only the Minister had been confronted by Deputy Bruton and I, he would have thought otherwise; that is what he seems to be saying. I am putting on the record that I do not have my mind made up on this issue. I would like to see the comparison with best practice Deputy Bruton refers to being subjected to scrutiny in the context of our regulatory requirements. To my knowledge that has not been done and the McDowell report, which is the genesis of this Bill with some tweaking here and there, did not address that question at all. It merely took the Government decision as a given and set about implementing it.I am interested in this from my experience with the DIRT inquiry, where the public hearings obviously preceded the legislation; the controversy preceded the Government decision but not the hearings into tax evasion and DIRT, which for the first time subjected the State and its agencies, including the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, to a kind of scrutiny not previously experienced.The first report of the DIRT inquiry found that the Central Bank did know about the deposit accounts problem before 1986 and knew about the DIRT problem after 1986. In the words of the then governor, "We had no legislative authority to go in and quantify it." The DIRT inquiry itself was persuaded that there was, ". . . no doubt that the bank knew of the problem going back before 1986 and that it discussed the matter with the Department of Finance." It further emerged that the bank felt constrained by the confidential protocol and that even if it had stumbled across particular cases of tax evasion it was prevented from bringing those to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. The first report of the DIRT inquiry traces the evidence given by the Central Bank and puts on record the fact that this pretty  extensive tax evasion was known to the Central Bank and that it discussed it at the time with the Department of Finance, though I am not saying the precise scale of it was known. The then Governor said they had no legislative authority to go in and quantify it. I refer here to the distinguished former Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O'Connell, and his evidence to the committee. For example, he stated:Chairman, the Central Bank participated at various times in discussions about the taxation of interest on deposits and non-resident accounts. The bank believed there was a problem regarding false statements on non-resident status but it had no direct knowledge of the amounts that might have been involved, however, because the focus of its inspection is prudential and it does not embrace taxation.Again, Mr. O'Connell said:I have made it quite clear that we were aware – I repeat, we were aware of this problem. We had no way of quantifying it, no way at all. We were unhappy about it. I said that already. I said we discussed this with the Department of Finance and that's all recorded here and so on. And I said it's a tax matter, to be solved by the tax system and all the parties involved were agreed on this.The point I am trying to make is that the weaknesses perceived in public in terms of whether it was tax compliance or the consumer dimension are admitted by the Central Bank in so much as its primary concern was prudential supervision. The Minister said the greatest comfort the consumer can get is the fact that his or her money is safe in the bank. He stated:When talking about protection of consumers of financial services, we must of course never forget that the most basic protection sought by the consumer is a reasonable assurance that the institution to which he or she entrusts his or her money is financially sound and that the financial system of which it is a part is fundamentally solid.That goes without saying and is obviously true. We take that as read, just as we take as read that the Central Bank has a good record in prudential supervision. There have been some lapses. Regarding the bank in the news at the moment, Ansbacher, one must ask how that bank seemed to function outside the system. If one looks at the manner in which the Ansbacher bank functioned one can only conclude that effectively it was functioning outside the system. However, generally speaking I accept that the bank has a good record in prudential supervision and I accept that it should be the first comfort for any consumer that there is not likely to be a run on his or her bank or that the bank is not likely to go under. Taking that as read, however, the issue of consumer protection was never to the fore of consideration  within the Central Bank, nor was the question of tax compliance.Deputy Bruton referred to the question of tax compliance and to his surprise that there is no provision in the Bill for better oversight of tax compliance. On page 53, provision is made in section 33(a)(k) to restate all the existing restrictive positions that prevented the Governor or the bank previously from bringing tax evasion to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, though the Minister's officials are looking again at section 33(a)(k) in terms of the overriding confidentiality provision. It is beyond belief to most compliant taxpayers that they can hear senior personnel in the Central Bank say they were aware there was tax evasion going on but that they were so restricted by the confidentiality protocol that they could not even bring that to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. That does not make any sense to the people in the street doing their best to pay their taxes. I do not know what the Minister's officials have in mind in terms of dealing with this section – one need only read it to see how restrictive it is. The interpretation put on it by senior officials during the DIRT inquiry was that they were prevented from taking the steps one would think should be required of or normally expected from an authority.That is still there in what is effectively a consolidated Bill. I look forward to seeing what changes the Minister's officials are contemplating, given that they said they would consider that again.In his speech, the Minister promised a second Bill. He drew attention to the fact that he will introduce a second Bill, which will do things that are long over due in my opinion, such as establish the financial services ombudsman and implement recommendations of the review group on auditing. It is an additional compelling argument to support Deputy Bruton's amendment that if that Bill is coming within a matter of months and it is so central to confidence in the consumer protection role of the authority, or whoever has that responsibility – the role of a financial services ombudsman, the implementation of the recommendations of the review group on auditing and other matters – I do not know why we cannot wait to measure those against a review of what we now propose to do against best practice.The review group on auditing made certain recommendations which I thought were cautious and conservative given what the DIRT inquiry, the beef tribunal and the tribunals currently under way have shown about auditors. I could never understand why in the Goodman case, a £500 million deficiency was discovered two or three months after the auditors signed off on the accounts. I cannot understand how Arthur Andersen conducted themselves vis-à-vis Enron. I cannot understand why senior personnel in Allied Irish Banks are so anxious to protect the auditors in the case of the Allfirst debacle. They do not seem to want auditors to have any whistleblowing  dimension imposed on them in terms of their responsibilities. The Minister, I suspect, will argue that this second Bill is essential in terms of judging the first Bill which is before the House. There is the additional argument as to why we should wait having regard to the momentous events that have recently happened and having regard to our own experience before proceeding as now proposed in terms of merging the two different responsibilities.I repeat that the Minister made no arguments. He seems to cede that there is merit in the argument being made on this side of the House that by all means the responsibility for regulation ought to rest with the Central Bank. I accept the arguments made about expertise in that regard, about experience, reputation, record, the influence it would have outside the country and its significance in terms of development here of the financial services sector. The development of the financial services sector ought to be distinct from the consumer protection dimension because inevitably there will be compromises if the developmental role is in any way confused with the consumer protection role. They are quite different. I do not argue and I have never argued, although I had the opportunity to put many questions on this matter to the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and others during the DIRT inquiry but I am persuaded, for the reasons I have just given, in terms of the competence and experience of staff and the signal it would send abroad, that the Central Bank is probably the place for regulation. The jury is still out on whether one can create a new authority that purports to give balanced consideration to the consumer dimension because consumers in this economy believe they have been ripped off by the banks and the financial institutions. They believe that a proliferation of charges were created in the past that were not merited. They believe excessive profits are being taken in this jurisdiction and we are now being asked to believe it is possible to meld into one organisation the consumer and the prudential responsibility. I do not know if it is. We are going to create a consumer director within this authority. Is he  primus inter pares with the regulatory responsibility? How is the balance that ought to exist to be worked out between them?I have no argument with treating the financial services sector as a single industry. That makes sense. I had the experience of having to live with the aftermath of the Tony Taylor affair. I am not sure any regulation would necessarily prevent that kind of thing happening but at the time it brought a sharp focus on the resources devoted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to regulation of financial intermediaries. The decision I made at the time was that that responsibility ought to be transferred to the Central Bank. That is right. The Taylor affair was not the first time that people who invested their money were defrauded in various circumstances.  The expertise and resources rested with the Central Bank to do that.Under the Consumer Credit Act I had the opportunity to bring in requirements that obliged the financial institutions in future that if they contemplated any new bank charge a case would have to be set out to the Director of Consumer Affairs together with a fee. The Director of Consumer Affairs had the power to prevent such an additional charge. That power is imported into this Bill and will go to the single regulatory authority together with a decision to implement the McDowell conclusion that funding generally ought to be levied from the industry. I would like to discuss that issue in the House. I can see the arguments for it. I can also see the dangers of regulatory capture. Many ordinary taxpayers believe the Central Bank traditionally has been overly sensitive to the requirements of bankers. It is not often that a housewife, a trade unionist or a consumer representative is on the board of the Central Bank. I do not know if we have any reason to believe that will necessarily change.We are going to have an authority that will have the onerous responsibility of regulation, prudential supervision on the one hand, consumer protection on the other hand. The argument obviously is why not beef up the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs? Why not give the director the statutory power that she and her predecessor argued is necessary? The Central Bank could deal with the regulation aspect and the Director of Consumer Affairs could deal with the consumer aspect, provided it is statutorily based and the resources are forthcoming. I would like to have heard the Minister argue why that cannot be done. He simply shooed all arguments, accepted the McDowell report and said we must implement the decision.Should credit unions be encompassed by this authority? We must have that debate. Had I been asked that question when I introduced the Credit Union Act I would have said no. There was never a Bill upon which so many Members spoke. In acknowledging an upcoming general election they wished to praise their local credit union. It was, nonetheless, a genuine statement by so many Members of the distinctive contribution of the credit union movement. Events since then do no more than reflect on the quality of supervision by the board – not by the registrar – and the quality of management, issues that are a cause of concern to thousands of credit union members. Mistakes have been made, as they have been made in the private, in the credit union movement resulting in divisions. Different unions see the world differently; local community based credit unions see things differently than big employment based ones.If credit unions are to come under the remit of the regulatory authority, I cannot see an ongoing role for the Registrar of Friendly Societies as this is the greater part of his responsibilities. I have an open mind on whether a director for the credit  unions can do the job. I do not suppose there is any reason they could not. This provision raises questions about the future role of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. I accept in principle that there is no reason the financial services sector ought not to be unified. The merits of merging the consumer interest and the question of prudential supervision is a different matter. Hopefully we will have more time, separate from Committee Stage, to go into some of the very detailed and complex questions which are given rise to here. I presume we will be taking a vote on the Fine Gael amendment at the end of this debate.The Minister should give greater consideration to this very major decision. The House will rise in three or four weeks time. I do not decry the competence or record of the Central Bank generally but Irish consumers are tired of being ripped off. We need to be confident that we are not compromising the consumer interest in the interests of an organisation which lends itself to the description that a camel is a horse made by a committee. We have devised a very complex structure and I would like to see it tested before we legislate to put it into law.

I have no doubt with the upcoming debate on the re-run of the Nice Treaty that we will have various opportunities to engage.This Bill is, interestingly, partly the result of the report of the implementation advisory group on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector, an expert group chaired by Deputy Michael McDowell now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The original proposals for a single financial regulator have been watered down because of EU Commission directives and requirements. This is yet another example of the legislative authority of this Dáil and the sovereignty of this State being undermined by the over-centralised European Union. I hope the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance will address this issue when they reply to the debate.It has been clear for some time that the Central Bank was failing in many aspects of its role. The report of the Committee of Public Accounts on DIRT fraud showed just how bad these failings were. Partly due to Central Bank policy, the taxpayer was out of pocket as the bank deliberately overlooked the fraudulent activities of Ireland's top banks, private and public, allowing them to open illegal bank accounts for up to 50,000 customers. Not only did the bank's authorities allow this environment of fraud to flourish, they lobbied the Government not to intervene as they claimed it would cause the flight of money out of the economy, or so they told us.If the Central Bank was prepared to turn a blind eye to this, what other failings existed in its operations? More importantly, what does this Bill do to redress those failings? The Central Bank  was only failing to protect the customer. One of the positive aspects of this Bill is the inclusion of a Commissioner for Consumer Protection. The authority will have its work cut out for it in that regard. Irish banks enjoy a return on their equity that is double the EU average. We have the most profitable banks in Europe. Where are these profits coming from? They are, of course, coming from ordinary customers who are being ruthlessly exploited.Irish banks are charging customers for a range of services that their directly comparable counterparts in Britain do not. These services include the setting up an overdraft or a direct debit, account maintenance charges, ATM withdrawals and lodgements. Ulster Bank, in this State, charges €25 a year for setting up an overdraft, yet offers this service free elsewhere. It charges customers here just over €3 for setting up a direct debit and €5 per annum for account maintenance yet it does not apply these charges elsewhere. There is no charge for ATM withdrawals, lodgements or for writing a cheque for this bank's customers elsewhere yet there are such charges here. The primary reason this is allowed to continue is weak regulators. If the new authority does not tackle this exploitation, the legislation will be futile.Part of the failing of the existing Central Bank was that it refused to use the powers it had. Much is made of the fact that in the modern market economies we need powerful regulators, but to whom will they be accountable? It is clear that the Central Bank was effectively above Government or any democratic control of its activities. We need to ensure the regulator is accountable to the Dáil, the voters and, more importantly, bank customers. In my view, there is not enough commitment in the Bill to these important clients. It is notable that there is more emphasis on outlining our responsibilities in an EU context than there is on the rights of Irish consumers.Access to banking services has become an important issue in parts of rural and urban Ireland where banks have been closing branches and withdrawing services. A real regulator would have the power to ensure a universal access to financial services regardless of where one lives. The Bill overlooks any responsibility in this matter.I worked in the commercial banking sector for 12 years and I recall the number of postings I had in different parts of the jurisdiction. Some of those smaller branches no longer exist and I am aware of the devastating consequences for those small rural communities which have suffered as a result. I make this point as somebody who has been at the coalface of the delivery of that service in the past and who appreciates the problems and the difficulties that such contraction has presented to bank customers in different parts of the country.The recent report into motor insurance costs only underlined what all of us in this House must have already known. Once again, Irish customers are being ripped off by those who sell them finan cial services. All of this happened while the regulators did nothing. Clearly, as in the case of the banks, customers of insurance companies are being exploited.We want to see a regulator with powers of inspection, visiting financial institutions, investigating their practices and forcing them to repay the moneys they have siphoned out of Irish customers over the years. In case people think that is a step beyond the potential reality, let us examine the situation north of the Border in relation to the electricity regulator who successfully squeezed money from overcharging power companies and paid it back to the customers. We need to see the same happening here and on a much wider scale in the whole area of insurance.This evening, within a short time of my concluding this contribution, I will meet representatives of a manufacturing company in my constituency who are here to meet Deputies from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and others pressing their concerns whereby, due to the practices of the insurance industry, their company is now at risk and the jobs it provides are now in jeopardy. That is serious and that concern which I have to face and address before this day is out is reflected in constituencies represented by Deputies throughout this Chamber. We have to seriously grasp the nettle in regard to the insurance company sector.The DIRT debacle and the overcharging scandal at NIB in recent years have shown failures at the highest level of management in financial services in Ireland. How many of the executives and directors who preside over this failure are still at work? The regulator should have the power to ban any director from office who is found to have broken tax or banking law or enabled their customers or employees to break these laws. It is laughable that the very people who let the DIRT fraud happen escaped without censure.Money does not acknowledge borders and the debacle at Ansbacher and Allfirst began in the Irish financial system. It is important we recognise that. We need to act on this issue and empower our regulator to be able to act to find not just tax defrauders but the financial institutions which, either through laxity or malice, are allowing fraud be perpetrated. Fraud costs money and this money is always borne by the taxpayer and the banking customer.Why has it taken nearly five years to get to the point where we can only now name the holders of illegal Ansbacher accounts? Does this Bill take up any of the lessons learned from the Flood, McCracken and Moriarty tribunals when it comes to ensuring proper management of financial institutions?We need to recognise that with all these failures in the private banking and financial services sector there is an obvious role for a State bank and insurance company. These would be State banks or companies that would be efficiently and properly run, not exploitatively, as is obviously  the case in the private sector currently. Once upon a time there was a Labour Party which supported such a bank. Where does it stand on this important proposal today?For our part, we in Sinn Féin will continue to campaign for the establishment of both a State bank and State insurance company as we believe such State institutions would be of real national benefit.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for agreeing to share time with me.What is proposed in the Bill appears to ignore the central tenet of the McDowell report in terms of having a stand alone, independent financial services authority and I am not sure if we will get the opportunity to hear Deputy McDowell, now a full member of the Government, express his opinions on that central recommendation. Even if he does not, I accept what the Government is proposing in relation to the Central Bank because it is the best way to proceed in terms of this type of regulatory authority, not least because there is a need for greater justification for the Central Bank which, after the onset of the euro, no longer has the responsibilities of a central bank in terms of the control of money supply and seeking to control the rate of inflation.What is proposed in the Bill is subject to question and is a half-hearted attempt to deal with the issues involved in the lack of proper regulation of the financial services sector in general. The Central Bank already has significant regulatory powers in terms of the banking system and real questions have to be asked as to how those powers have been applied in the past ten years at least in terms of financial scandals that have occurred. Is that because the regulatory controls given to the Central Bank have not been adequate or is it a more central question of either an inability or an unwillingness to practice those regulatory controls? If it is the second area and if the Central Bank is being expanded to take on these new powers, does the confidence exist that such new regulatory powers will be applied to ensure that what happened in the past will not happen again?The Bill tries to address many of the concerns about financial services and the Green Party welcomes the renewed emphasis on consumer protection. It is amusing to see, however, that the Minister agrees with the McDowell group in recognising the valuable contribution and unique role of the credit unions in Irish society. That is certainly a new departure for the Minister because during the lifetime of the previous Dáil he appeared to take every opportunity to demean and denigrate the whole system of community financing that is the credit union movement. Given what is taking place in the Phoenix Park at the moment, the role of the credit unions in adding to the gaiety of the nation is something that should be recognised even if the Construction Industry Federation might not be too happy  that the money allocated to people was not used for its intended purpose.There are other aspects in terms of controls that are to be welcomed, for example, the appeals tribunal and the establishment of a commissioner but the real problems are not being addressed. They have to do mainly with the insurance industry.Other speakers referred to the recent report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the colossal profit margins being imposed in relation to people's necessity, that is, the statutory obligation to have motor insurance. This affects mainly young people and their ability not only to meet their transport needs but also to become fully functioning members of society in an economic as much as a social sense. Many young people who have been affected by the sharp practices operating in motor insurance have been prevented from acquiring the means to achieve an economic livelihood because of the stranglehold of what passes for competition in the motor insurance sector which is a cartel. The hope is that regulatory authorities that come into being in the insurance industry will tackle these matters.There is a more important area that I have not heard discussed in this Chamber, in which a regulatory authority can play an important role, and it also concerns the insurance industry. It is the issue of public liability insurance and how it affects the voluntary and community sector. Such insurance for voluntary and community groups is, in effect, a tax, even if it does not go to Government agencies. It is collected by the private sector through insurance and compromises the ability and willingness of people to contribute to society by providing social services that the Government is unwilling or unable to provide. I hope that what is being proposed will address the central issues concerning the type of requirements placed on such groups in the first instance, the liability that exists in the event of accident or mishap, the premia charged to meet such liabilities and the unwillingness of insurance companies to deal properly with the effects on the country of undermining voluntary and community activity.Of concern in this Bill is the extent to which the Minister, the Department and the Government need to seek sanction for regulating the financial services by having recourse to the European Central Bank, a consequence of involvement in the European monetary system. It compromises our ability more than we imagined on joining the euro. It involves more than not being able to set our interest rates, control inflation or the money supply in and out of the country. Such decisions are being made elsewhere and we are hostages to fortune. When the extent of that control comes to this level, where we have to seek permission to change our legislation – even the degree to which we can move legislation regarding the regulation of financial services – we should be concerned. I hope the House will reflect that concern as this Bill progresses. I put on record the Green Party's reservations about  this Bill and we will put forward a number of amendments to improve it. While in a general sense it meets a need, we hope the Central Bank and the new financial services authority will use their powers to avoid the type of problems we saw in the past.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because I recall on numerous occasions in this House, with Deputy Rabbitte, questioning the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance on who was going to take responsibility for the single financial regulator. Four years ago the Government made the decision to proceed with this regulator, but subsequently there was a turf war between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance about which Department would have the responsibility and bring forward this legislation. It is evident from this Bill's publication that those who championed the consumer's interests have lost out in this turf war.Chapter One of the authority's establishment states that it is to take the financial services supervisory function of the Central Bank of Ireland and the new Director of Consumer Affairs will be subservient to the authority's chief executive whose main remit will be the supervisory role in relation to those functions it is taking over from the Central Bank. The Central Bank's main concern has always been solvency, not consumer protection. Sadly, that will lose out in this legislation. We should have seriously considered additional powers to give teeth to the Director of Consumer Affairs so that the director could act independently of this authority in protecting the rights of the consumer because the Central Bank has persistently and consistently failed to protect these rights.Deputy Ó Caoláin highlighted some of these problems in relation to bank charges which over many years were hidden in the documentation distributed by the banks to the consumer. Only recently have they had access to the breakdown of those charges. It was recently highlighted, and many journalists have published articles on it, that the consumers have been charged much more than was advertised by the banks. The other element is the closure of many bank branches in which the Central Bank is not prepared to get involved. Throughout the country the closure of many rural bank branches, especially in the west, has ensured that the consumer has no access to banking facilities. The former Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that she was going to introduce a type of universal system through the AIB but that has yet to come to pass and many parts of the country have banks closing and basic facilities unavailable.Fine Gael will table an amendment calling for a full assessment of best practice in regulatory supervision to take into account the Enron and Allfirst debacles and how they should influence how we go forward from here with regulation in  this legislation. We must remember that in the Allfirst case, as in others, it was the small investor who bore the brunt of the debacle, the small investor that puts a few euros away in a bank, the AIB in this case. We could have a similar situation in relation to other major banking systems. Many investors, who were encouraged by the banks not to put money on deposit but into shares or equities, have found that the price of these has collapsed because of the lack of controls within the banks. What control will this new regulator have of these offshore spurs of major banks because it can have a dramatic impact on many small investors? Yet to date that type of protection has not been in place. We also need a full assessment of the consumer protection element of this legislation.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on his re-election and reappointment and wish him well during his term in office.Fine Gael believes that the programme for Government is an important document and should be treated as such. It should set the agenda for the nation, identify priorities and chart clear timetables for delivery. The current pro gramme for Government was negotiated from two very detailed and, in some respects, very different election manifestos, both of which contained specific promises over a wide range of public policy areas. The merger of the two manifestos could have produced a thick volume of policy initiatives to be undertaken within specific periods during the Government's term in office.Both Government parties spent the first half of the recent general election campaign demanding detailed forecasts on the economy and costings from every other party except themselves. They maintained this barrage of accountability throughout the campaign.The Irish Times of 2 May reporting on the failed attempt by Fianna Fáil to introduce the Spanish Inquisition in the shape of dubiously titled “independent economic assessment” of the party's manifestos said that Fianna Fáil remained determined to keep the issue of fiscal responsibility centre stage. On that day, the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, then Chief Whip and number cruncher extraordinaire accused Fine Gael of “refusing to produce specific costings for specific proposals” and vowed that he and his party would “continue to argue that the other parties are promising the public more than they can or will fund”. It is obvious that after 17 May that same champion of fiscal accountability suffered what may become terminal memory loss when he metamorphosed into chief negotiator on the programme for Government. He managed to negotiate a programme so devoid of specific costings or specific proposals that the page numbers on the printed copy are the most significant numerical statistics now available.To remind the Fianna Fáil members and the one and only of its members present what their obsession was during the campaign, I quote from the Minister, Deputy Brennan's words of wisdom, "You can't have a health service or an education service if there isn't a sound economy."  He may live to regret that. We may live to regret that he is right, but the Government is wrong. It is obvious the Minister has lost both his memory and his calculator.True to form in the programme for Government the old maxim of "do as I say, not as I do" applies. Instead of a torrent of specifics, the programme contains only the froth and bubble of aspiration. If the programme is notable for anything, it is its elasticity, its lack of any measurable timeframe for delivery and of targets. The programme for Government is a catch all document, a sort of political "whatever you're having yourself". This document is politically cute and its vagueness is designed to make Ministers less rather than more accountable when new challenges lie ahead in every Department.There are, however, a few hostages to fortune in the programme. First, it clearly promotes itself as the second in a series of two – the plan for the second half of a Government, not a new beginning in very different economic circum stances. The Government admits that it should be judged on its record since 1997, not on what it can achieve from 2002 onwards. That will leave it somewhat exposed when reality bites, as it will. Second, the document pledges to build a fair society of equal opportunity in a period of unique and unprecedented growth. It admits that the quality of infrastructure and the standard of our public services are not what we should expect after five years of unparalleled prosperity. Third, it commits to transforming Ireland completely in the next five years. These are vague enough aspirations, but they are targets of a kind.In attempting to deliver on its pledges, the Government faces a number of serious challenges, many of which are of its own making: public spending is out of control, up 27% in the first five months of this year alone; income tax revenues in the same period were down 15%; the inflation rate is 4.8%, twice the European average; a deteriorating competitiveness, which is threatening jobs in the multinational sector; a reluctance among some of the social partners to enter into a new national agreement; Third World transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures which are hampering economic activity; continuing regional imbalances which see growth choking the eastern seaboard at the expense of the other regions; and growing dissatisfaction with the quality, delivery and accessibility of the key public services.During the past five years of economic growth and prosperity the Government managed to throw huge amounts of taxpayers' money at problems, but it failed to bring about any real change in the way in which services are provided or plans are implemented. Never was as much money thrown at each Department as during the past five years, yet we have ended up with worse public services. The health services are an excellent example of this failure. Having waited over four years to produce a national health strategy, what eventually emerged was a list of spending commitments rather than a strategy for reforming the way in which health care should be provided to our people.During the general election campaign the Minister for Health and Children got over-excited at one stage and gave the latest in a series of further false promises, that of permanently ending hospital waiting lists by the end of 2004. I note from the programme for Government that it contains no such commitment.In terms of delivery, we must judge Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on their record. In 1997 and again in 2002 the Government promised to tackle waiting lists, yet today there are 26,126 people waiting for a hospital bed, more than half of them in the Dublin area. In 1997 and again in 2002 the Government promised that no adult would have to wait longer than 12 months for a hip replacement, but today five out of every ten have waited well over a year. In 1997 and again in 2002 the Government promised that no child would have to wait longer than six months  to have his or her tonsils out, but today seven out of every ten children wait much longer.The Tánaiste's party, the Progressive Democrats, only discovered patients in 2002 in the context of the publication of the national health strategy. Their remedy was to fly them out of the country as soon as possible.There are many thousands of people in the queue to join a queue waiting for initial assessment by a consultant who are not part of these statistics and some of those people will wait years for treatment. Only 78 of the 709 hospital beds promised this year have so far been opened – none of them in the Dublin area where waiting lists are highest.There is a lot of ground to be made up and certainly a lot more to do because the previous Government failed to do anything other than fling cash at the health service for five years. That negligence has slowed everything down. The health section of the programme for Government relies heavily and exclusively on the implementation of the health strategy, but there is no indication of how this can be realised or how much of it will be dependent on the depleted Exchequer resources. Will there be further recrimination in the Cabinet between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children in relation to resourcing this essential part of our programme for Government?Another example of the Government failing to grasp the nettle is the much delayed national development plan. After five years we have no national spatial strategy and no public private partnerships and there are no new road projects starting this year.The programme for Government is proof that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats conned the people with their election manifestos. They bought the electorate over a period of economic prosperity with tax cuts and child benefit. Instead of solid economic foundations, we have shifting sands. Instead of the economic calculator of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, we have the shifting sands of depleted resources. So much for the Progressive Democrats watchdog at the Cabinet table. So much for the party of fiscal rectitude and so much for an aspirational programme for Government.This programme is nothing but a wish list with no clear direction and this Administration has no idea how, or if, it will be implemented. It claims: "We will ensure that every school building attains set modern standards."  What modern standards does the programme refer to and by when will this be done? What guarantee is there for children of this country who are sitting in crumbling, cold, wet and dangerous school buildings that their lot will be improved before the next election? Will we get another published list of schools that are about to be improved but which will never happen?The programme for Government is an exercise in deception of the people because it claims "we will significantly improve transport services in the  regions". How will they be improved and how many more buses does the Government promise? What kind of improvement is planned for rail transport? What kind of guarantee is the Government offering to people in rural Ireland who have no choice other than to drive cars that are expensive to insure on roads which continue to deteriorate? Most important of all, how will the Government pay for any improvement?The programme for Government also envisages "the promotion of integrated ticketing and smart card technologies which will allow a differential pricing system to be introduced". This is a reheated promise drawn from the 1997 Fianna Fáil manifesto which stated: "Tickets between Luas, DART and buses will be fully interchangeable". Then there is Luas itself. Five years ago, Fianna Fáil went to the people claiming the party would build "all three Dublin light rail lines". Where do we stand today? We stand waiting for a tram, with the next one not due for at least two years. The only tram we got from the last Government was the phantom tram produced by the former Minister for Public Enterprise for exhibition purposes at Merrion Square some months ago.On tourism, there is bluster and waffle but nowhere near the kind of dynamic, urgent and far-reaching policies that are needed to reinvigorate the sector. Fine Gael proposed to provide some relief from local rates for tourism businesses suffering a decline in turnover of 15% or more in 2001 and 2002. As Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh knows the devastating impact foot and mouth disease had in relation to the tourism sector. The Government did nothing to help the sector and does not propose to help the hard-pressed tourism sector in 2002.The Government also claims: "We will vigorously pursue actions to ensure that that everyone is tax compliant."  The Government will forgive me, and forgive the country, if I am sceptical of such promises coming from this Administration. The fact that there is no timescale, no package of measures and no detail on how this will be done suggests this is little more than a vague nod in the direction of the conscience of the Progressive Democrats.On the national development plan, there is no mention whatsoever of the current difficulties with the plan and instead simply states that the various measures will be completed. The whole nation knows the dire financial restrictions that are facing the implementation of the NDP – mainly due to the lack of competence of the Ministers opposite to do the business and get the programme in place. There is no plan to reverse the situation where 33 road developments are on hold, there is no plan to address the gaping economic holes that are evident in future projected start-ups and there is no hope of Ireland getting the infrastructure it deserves under this Government.Many people, particularly landowners, have  had to endure over the last number of years the spectre of Government big brother descending on them in order to build motorways and major road infrastructural projects throughout the country. They have had great patience. They did not get much understanding but they knew improvements in our road infrastructure were essential from an economic point of view. What will happen the landowners when they discover there will be long delays and they will be in limbo wondering if the projects will ever go ahead. Will the lines that are sterilised now be allowed for development? Will they be allowed for the cut-off points envisaged or for planning permission? There are huge problems in relation to planning and development due to the negligence of this Government in speeding up the national development plan and implementing it on schedule.How will the Government safeguard the future of our young people, the elderly and the sick? How will it cope with benchmarking? I believe many of the vague aspirations in this programme for Government will fall off the end of its wish list. I regret to say that the programme for Government is nothing more than a compilation of vague aspiration which regrettably is not costed, but will be the hallmark of the Government's ineptitude over the next number of years.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The last five years of Government can be defined as the congestion years. As the Tánaiste put it, we have a First World economy but a Third World infrastructure. Traffic congestion is one of the biggest impediments to business in the capital functioning efficiently. The lack of basic infrastructure and access is the single biggest bar to developing the regions.The establishment of a single Department of Transport is welcome and will ensure, we hope, a co-ordinated approach to the planning and implementation of the national development plan and other infrastructural developments. While the establishment of a new Department is positive, the specifics in the programme for Government are few. The lack of any detail on how infrastructural projects are to be funded raises serious questions about the ability to deliver on these projects on time. The timescale for many projects under the NDP has already been pushed back. For example, last January the Government set a date of 2006 for the completion of the rail link to Dublin Airport, yet under the programme for Government this has already been pushed out to 2007. We are more likely to see this project completed by 2010 rather than 2007.In a recent interview the Minister stated that he had been given no guarantees that the funding required would be forthcoming. There remains a serious question mark over the ability of this Government to adequately fund the major infrastructural projects required to prevent the country grinding to a halt.The programme for Government makes bland commitments regarding a number of proposals  such as "the capital development programme for regional airports will be pushed through". When? It says: "We will significantly improve transport services to the regions", but no detail is provided. It says: "We recognise the importance of maintaining a national airline", but how will that be done? It states: "We will ensure that access to public transport is one of the criteria taken into consideration by the planning process."  Do we have to wait another five years for another planning Bill for that?There is no mention of the timescale involved. Will the Government introduce measures to address these issues in the short-term, which is what is required, or will it continue the policy of the previous Administration by introducing major policy initiatives at the end of its term in office without providing adequate resources to achieve the goals as set out in its glitzy launches?Other proposals raise more questions than they answer. For example, the programmes states: "We will put in place a new five year plan to ensure non-national roads are properly signposted."  Where was the old plan? There was none. The programme also states: "We will allocate a portion of the budget on road improvement projects to the provision of new footpaths and allow pedestrians to walk with greater safety and comfort."  It is local roads which need footpaths and there is no budget for the improvement of these. The Government plans to establish a traffic corps following a six month consultation process. When will this commence? Will it be like the review of the school bus safety programme which was promised in 1998 but has not taken place yet?The programme commits the new Minister to replacing the Road Transport Act, 1932, to allow for new services in the bus market. This is not a simplistic solution to bus competition. The aircoach service in Dublin, one of the biggest competitors to the State sector, lost over €300,000 in the last financial year. Even a service which is perceived to be commercially viable needs some element of State subvention. This will not be an easy problem to solve.Projects which have been given the green light will have to be reviewed. The Dublin Port tunnel is not high enough to cater for heavy goods vehicles using the port. IBEC believes it is not too late to change the height of this tunnel, yet there is no mention of it in the plan. The decision by Irish Rail to wind down its freight service must be overturned. It also requires major investment and incentives to take freight off our congested road network. A small level of investment in this area could result in huge benefits as a result of heavy vehicles being taken off the roads. That would not only impact on congestion but also on road safety and harmful emissions in many of our smaller towns. The programme gives a commitment to the improvement of rail services and rolling stock but investment in rolling stock will not necessarily achieve an incremental increase in the level of service. It is planned to introduce an  additional 80 diesel cars into the service in 2002 and 2003 yet there is no indication of the number of cars taken out of the system which they will replace.The roads programme raises a number of serious questions, including the level of funding available to deliver the projects. A further bottleneck in the system will be the impact the Planning and Development Act, 2000 will have on the supply of aggregates. Under this Act, all existing quarries will have to apply for a new licence under a new licensing regime. That problem has not been addressed.The programme outlines what will be done over five years but it is weak on specifics, deadlines and the funding that will be required to achieve it.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the programme for Government. It contains some fine thoughts and aspirations but when one examines its content in detail, many questions arise about its various aspects. The most striking issue is the deficit in infrastructure.Look at the programme implemented by this Government over the last five years. It brought forward a national development plan which everybody agreed contained many worthwhile projects. However, over the years the Government did not put in place the finances to develop that infrastructure. Throughout the country, roads and bypasses for various towns have been promised but few of them have commenced. I am aware of one case where planning of the bypass started more than nine years ago but work on the project still has not started. It was given the green light earlier this year but there was not enough money allocated to the county council involved to buy the land to start work on the project.What is happening on the ground is a complete contrast to what is contained in the Government's programme. This applies across all infrastructure. Let us look at what is happening to the railways. I believe we could have one of the finest railway systems in the world if it was properly developed but we have not done that or developed the huge potential of our railways. The programme only refers to the railways in Dublin and what will be done over the next few years in Dublin. There is nothing about the rail line from Dublin to Cork or the line along the western coast or the huge potential they have. Trucks regularly break down on our major roads but that transport could be transferred to the rail network if it was properly planned. That is not mentioned in the programme for Government.The programme is Dublin orientated; it is only concerned with what will be done in Dublin. This is the problem. The eastern side of the country has been developed so that it is jammed with people and traffic while the western and southern parts of the country are underdeveloped. The next generation will look back on what is happening now and see that we allowed this country to develop on only one side. That will lead to a  major problem and we will come to regret it. We have particularly neglected the road and rail elements of infrastructure.The programme outlines what will be done for agriculture, food and rural development. I was struck by one comment in this section in which the Government says it will seek to develop the agricultural colleges as wider rural development takes place. What happened in the past under this Government? It closed five agricultural colleges throughout the country. It is a failure on the part of Government to neglect the education of young farmers and this Government has done that. The structure of agriculture is falling asunder simply because the Government is not educating young farmers but closing agricultural colleges.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. He got the credit for keeping foot and mouth disease out of the country last year. He is now in that Department longer than the photographs on the wall and is keeping everybody else out of Agriculture House. I am disappointed he could not find a place for my colleague in Mayo. There are many junior Ministers but, for the first time since the foundation of the State, there is neither a senior nor junior Minister from Mayo. If the Minister could take the wall down in Agriculture House, he could let one of my colleagues into the Department as Minister of State.I know the Minister is possessive about the Department and that many people are concerned that he remain there. However, it is not the working class or the poor farmers in the west of Ireland on the farm assist scheme who are concerned but the stock farmers and breeders. I have nothing against the Minister but I was hoping there would be a change, a new direction or new beginning to give the farmers of this country a chance. I am disappointed that the Minister has not already put forward a package for farmers. They are in disarray. They cannot cut silage or survive due to the terrible weather. The weather broke when the Government got into office. I blame the Government for it because it has taken credit for everything else. It would even take the credit if the weather was good. The Taoiseach is probably in the Phoenix Park tonight telling the people he was on the substitutes bench if he was needed. That is the type of Taoiseach we have.There was a serious warning tonight from the Minister for Finance. When one sees the Minister for Finance on the television saying that we might be talking ourselves into a recession one can be sure there are bad days ahead and that there is bad news for the country. The Minister gave that warning tonight. The good news came out before the election when all the announcements were made. It was only in the last week of the election campaign that Fianna Fáil started pulling back when it knew it might have a chance to return to Government. It was typical Fianna Fáil; it thought it would not be in Government to deliver. Now it is caught.The Government has put forward its programme and we will monitor it weekly, monthly and annually. In health, the Government promised that in two years nobody in the country will have to wait for any type of medical procedure. Thank God because there are hundreds of people in my constituency and thousands throughout the country waiting for medical procedures. I will be waiting to see if the Minister, Deputy Martin, can deliver in that regard.The Government was not back in power a week before it turned its attention to the FÁS schemes. We know what the Progressive Democrats stand for and it is not for the weak, the poor or the sick. They represent the strongest sector in society, the rich. Their motto is "get rich as fast as you can and do not care about the poor". They have already attacked the FÁS schemes. The Minister said today that she intends to introduce a new scheme to replace them. The FÁS schemes have worked but that is the reason the Government is now tampering with them. The schemes helped people who were not in employment to be retrained and to be brought back into society. The schemes gave them self respect.Of course, the rich in this country do not want that. They want to keep the poor down and in their place. A man once said to me that the rich, regardless of whether they are Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, will always look after the rich but the Progressive Democrats are there to look after the rich. The Minister represents agriculture in this programme for Government, but there is very little mention of agriculture in the document. The former man from the IFA, Deputy Parlon, used to be up there in the gallery telling us down here what we were doing wrong for agriculture, but what did he do for agriculture when he had such an opportunity, when he was virtually writing the programme for Government?I went through the document and could not find a lot for agriculture, and I will be passing on that message to my good friends in the IFA. I lost some of their support in this election. They went with the Independents, but no harm, I may get their support back again. They will be glad to have me now, given that their Independent man did not get elected.All I can say to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Government is that it is time to stop picking on the poor, the weak and the sick. The rich are well able to look after themselves, and I will be depending upon the Minister to do something for the hard-pressed farmers over the coming weeks. We do not want to wait until there is a disaster, we want action now. The Minister must go to the Minister for Finance and tell him he wants a package for the farmers.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I take this opportunity to raise a number of issues, particularly in regard to health, agriculture and infrastructure. The Government obviously finds itself in a very different economic situation from that outlined by it only a few short  weeks ago. It is clear from the media coverage that there has been a major drop in tax receipts, together with a major increase in costs. The two factors simply do not add up. When one takes into account all the promises made in the manifestos before the election and then looks at the programme for Government, it is evident that even in the few intervening weeks, the Government parties realised that what they promised in their manifestos was unrealistic.I wish to bring one small issue to the Minister's attention. The programme for Government states that appointments for treatment within three months, or referral, will be achieved. I wonder what has changed so dramatically that this can happen. I would like to highlight some of the correspondence I have had from people in the past few weeks. A consultant ENT surgeon wrote: "As you may be aware, my waiting list for my outpatient clinic in Monaghan is now approximately 2 years."  There is no word of three months there. He stated: "I cannot at this stage give any indication when the patient will have her surgery until after she has been assessed."  We have a long way to go. In the case of a lady in Cappagh Hospital, the waiting time for a hip operation is 12 to 18 months. Then we turn to the North-Eastern Health Board's hospital for orthopaedics, where 718 patients were on the waiting list in March 2002. I have been issued with a record of how that shortfall has come about. The current staffing level is three permanent consultants, two temporary consultants and one vacancy. The hospital is currently advertising for additional staff, but there is no hope of getting them. This is a long way off the three months that has been promised. One of the consultant orthopaedic surgeons wrote to me and begged me, as a TD for Monaghan, to try to get something done about the serious problems afflicting orthopaedic and other surgery in the area.I turn to the general hospital in my own area of Monaghan. The Minister for Health and Children promised that five junior doctors would be appointed to ensure that the treatment room could continue in Monaghan General Hospital. Those five junior doctors have not been appointed. The positions have not even been advertised. I warn the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the Minister for Health and Children if he is listening, that unless something is done quickly, the treatment room in Monaghan General Hospital will close down under this great administration on 1 July. I beg, at this last minute, that something be done about this.Moving on to infrastructure, we were promised on numerous occasions that if only we had the projects ready for operation, all three bypasses on the national road from Dublin to Derry – Derry being the third biggest city in the country – would be dealt with immediately. Two of those are now ready, but in 2002 there is not one penny of funding. The provision of EU money for the BMW region will end in 2006. I ask the Minister  for Finance whether money will be spent in the BMW region, as promised when this region was established, or will all the money be spent on the pale?I will finish on a cross-Border issue. I was at a meeting last week in Monaghan town regarding the Ulster canal and letters were read out from absent colleagues that they all support the reopening of the Ulster canal. Is the Minister for Finance giving his commitment to that? It is vital, if anything is to be done with the Ulster canal as a cross-Border project, that it is done now while there is still some EU money available.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The opening sentence in the crime section of this programme for Government states: "We stand for a society where all people can feel safe in their communities."  There is not one mention of rural communities in the document. I read it a couple of times but it seems to have been omitted. Crime is increasing throughout this country. There are more murders and rapes and there is more street violence, but street violence is not something that just happens in cities, it also occurs in villages throughout rural Ireland.What the Government seems to have done over the past five years is begin the centralisation of Garda stations around the country. What we are left with is a number of rural communities without a garda. Many of these places, years back, would have a garda sergeant and four regular gardaí, now they are left with nothing. Vast tracts of countryside are left unmanned by the Garda Síochána as a result.It is not just the public who are telling me this, the gardaí are complaining that it is very unfair for the general populace to be subjected to this. My biggest concern in this regard is for elderly people living in rural Ireland, having been left totally unprotected and unsafe in their homes. Many of them in my constituency of Waterford have been badly affected in the past three years, and you can pinpoint those places from where gardaí have been removed. There is a direct correlation between taking gardaí out of a small village and what happens afterwards.There are part-time gardaí living in other counties and they go home at 6 p.m. In many parts of Waterford where crime is committed, people have to go 30 miles before they get to Garda headquarters. That is simply unacceptable. To my mind, policing has a lot to do with intelligence gathering. It is about information, talking to the locals and figuring out what is going on. What we have done is left these areas without gardaí so they do not know what is going on. The locals have no opportunity to tell a policeman what exactly is going on as far as crime is concerned in the locality, and the problem just gets worse and worse. I know what I am talking about because my grandfather was a garda sergeant for years, and 40 years later they are still talking about him. It may not all be complimentary, but he had a presence, which is a very important factor.In many cases in rural Ireland banks have been  shut down, there is talk about shutting down post offices, teachers are leaving schools and now we are talking about shutting down Garda stations. Young gardaí are becoming managers. They are not encouraged to mix in local communities or to discover what is going on. Programmes are needed to encouraged young gardaí to live in the rural communities they serve, regardless of whether such schemes lead to pay increases or more promotion opportunities.

Contrary to what those opposite seek to portray, the programme is a comprehensive programme for action with several key aspects. It is clear, specific and targeted and sets out the priorities for action. It is grounded on the firm basis of seeking to maintain a balanced budgetary position and it reflects the wishes and aspirations of the electorate as recently expressed. Its delivery is supported by the previous Government's record of delivering on its targets during its five years in office. Those who read the programme can see at a glance that it is comprehensive. It covers all aspects of Government from economic and budgetary policy to building a caring society, ensuring balanced regional development, supporting civic life and building peace and justice within and outside the State.I fail to see how a charge of no clear targets or timeframes can be made. The Government has committed in the programme to improving the quality of public services in the specific areas with which I deal. We will deliver further real improvements to pensioners and those on low incomes and we will meet our targets on major capital and investment programmes. We have committed to establishing the National Development Finance Agency, an innovative concept to address our infrastructural deficit. We will use once-off revenues to create a national transformation fund to enhance capital investment. We will assist enterprise and employment with specific cuts in business taxes in the area of corporation tax and capital gains tax and we will direct resources at those on low pay by removing earners on the minimum wage from the income tax  net, putting 80% of tax payers on the standard rate of income tax and using tax credits to better target tax resources to achieve key policy objectives.The Government's social welfare policies include a target for reducing consistent poverty. It has established a benchmark of €150 per week, in 2002 terms, for social welfare payments and it has set a goal of achieving a State pension of at least €200 per week by 2007. The new programme re-emphasises the Government's commitment to key aspects of the health strategy, including increasing bed capacity by a specific amount, reducing waiting lists, reforming primary care to provide extended coverage and developing community based services for the elderly. The level of investment in the health services since 1997 has been very significant and spending is no longer below the EU average.Deputies will have noted a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, commissioned by The Irish Times before the election. The report stated that the amount of money spent by Ireland on health is above the European Union average, including the amount in the United Kingdom following recent spending increases by the Chancellor, Mr. Brown. Furthermore, the ESRI's research, conducted by Professor John FitzGerald, showed that Irish spending on health will be above that of almost all EU countries as a percentage of GNP by the time the health strategy has been implemented. This refutes the accusation made over the years that the Government has not spent money on health. I have agreed on many occasions with the argument made inside and outside the House that many reforms are needed in the health service, but the independent research conducted for The Irish Times by Professor FitzGerald clearly shows that additional funding is not such a necessary reform. The accusation that sufficient resources are not being allocated in the health sector does not stand up to scrutiny. The report was not widely mentioned during the election campaign, but it was noted in the Department of Finance as it re-emphasised what I have been saying for some time.

Deputy Higgins will agree that the newspaper to which I referred is not a noted supporter of this Government. It has not supported me as Minister for Finance during the past five years and I do not expect that I will be treated differently in the next five years. The research which was reported must  be at least taken on board in this discussion. As we must ensure that a quality health product is delivered as a result of the extra resources, I decided in the last budget to establish a commission on health service funding to review, evaluate and make recommendations. I will return to the theme of value for money and its implications.The previous Government prioritised education and science during its term of office and provided an unprecedented level of funding to develop and improve services. Under the new programme, the Government will continue to pursue policies aimed at ensuring that children can achieve their potential and that the standards of education and facilities are maintained and improved. Policies will have particular regard to children with special needs and children and adults from disadvantaged areas. Where is the lack of targets or clarity in this? I could go through other parts of the programme in a similar vein, but I will leave that to my colleagues who will be speaking on the motion.Delivery of targets ultimately requires resources. We must generate these resources, use them prudently and seek maximum value for money. I view this last criterion as crucial in all cases but especially where the capacity to generate funding is more limited going forward than it has been in the recent past. It is not a matter of saving for saving's sake or efficiency for narrow business reasons, but of fairness all round. If an extra €1 of value can be realised, for example in health delivery, that yields an extra €1 for those areas of the health service which might otherwise lose out. It is not a matter of merely saving money; it is a public duty to see that the huge resources put into public service delivery meet as many real needs of the people as possible.I have made clear on many occasions that we can only spend the resources we have. We cannot spend funds we have not got or cannot reasonably generate. The most secure way to sustain the public finances is to keep a balance in the finances of Government. I took particular pains to include this underlying framework in my party's election manifesto and it can also be found in plain terms in the programme for Government. The programme makes it clear that this is part of our commitments under the EU growth and stability pact, which we signed up to before I became Minister for Finance. As a nation, we have given a sovereign commitment to keep Government finances close to balanced or in surplus and to take corrective action if there is an actual or expected divergence from the objective. The Government will respect this commitment. I can hardly see how such a budgetary framework could be clearer or more measurable. It is not only the Dáil that can judge actions in this area but the Commission and all other member states at ECOFIN. I am not aware of any such previous clear budgetary commitment put and endorsed in any election.In my view the critical issue is that the contents  of the programme for Government were endorsed by the electorate. The Opposition may not welcome the result but they cannot credibly ask the House to condemn the recently expressed choice of voters, as to do so would be perverse. All parties set out detailed proposals in the election; they sought to cost them and to set them in a budgetary framework. We had our differences on how coherent those costings and frameworks were in some cases, but the decision has been made and the Government's task now is to deliver.We spent a number of years talking about joining the euro. During the run up to the introduction of the euro I heard people say that this question was not put to the Irish people. As Members will be aware, the question was put to the people during the Maastricht referendum, even though much attention was not paid to it. The terms of the EU stability and growth pact were negotiated and clearly spelt out when we held the Presidency in 1996. As I have stated on a number of occasions and ad nauseam during the election campaign, irrespective of who occupies the position of Minister for Finance and irrespective of what party that individual is drawn from, we are bound by these commitments.There was some discussion in the House on the finance aspects of European matters arising from the recommendation by myself and Mr. Solbes that the deal was to be outside the broad economic policy guidelines. I pointed out at the time, whatever about the broad economic policy guidelines, the serious matter was the terms of the stability and growth pact. In recent months two member states have had some difficulties in this regard. The ECOFIN Council recently adjudicated on the German stability programme and the Portuguese programme. People will also be aware that an ECOFIN meeting is scheduled for this week in advance of the Seville European Council to finalise the position regarding the French proposals. It has been possible post the French elections to adjudicate on this matter in a more sober light. Therefore, the terms of the stability and growth pact are not of academic importance or something we can pick and choose. The rules were laid down in line with all the countries joining up to the euro.We will be in a privileged position in years to come. Perhaps in future Deputy Michael D. Higgins will be the Minister for Finance. Who knows what the electorate will throw up in the future. Deputy Joe Higgins may be Minister for Finance. There may be a majority of Sinn Féin Deputies in the House. They may form the Government and some of their illustrious group may occupy the position of Minister for Finance. Irrespective of what party is in office it will be bound by the rules of the euro. The Government and future Governments may make adjustments in micro areas and in terms of taxation or spending.

For example, under the terms of the stability and growth pact, the amount of money we sent to the pension reserve fund does not count. It is as if it never left the Government coffers. One is not penalised in terms of the stability and growth pact. On the other hand, one does not get credit for privatisation of State assets, except in terms of reducing the interest on the national debt. These issues must also be taken into account.The terms of the stability and growth pact are such, irrespective of who is Minister for Finance, that they will have to be adhered to. That aspect was highlighted more clearly during the election campaign despite all the talk during the previous five years. In the end, all parties regarded this as the main issue. In my view, this is the critical issue. What is in the programme is what was endorsed by the electorate. The Opposition may not welcome the result but it cannot ask the House to condemn the recently expressed choice of the electorate. That would be perverse. During the election campaign all the parties set out detailed proposals. All sought the costings of the said proposals in the budgetary framework. There were differences on how coherent those costings and frameworks were in some cases. However, the decision has been made and the Government must now deliver. I suggest that as a student of politics and a participant in the art of politics, Deputy Michael D. Higgins would be interested in this aspect from an academic viewpoint.I note since the election that some commentators more or less blame themselves for letting the Fianna Fáil Party in particular dominate a lot of the election coverage regarding the economy and that the Opposition fell into the trap also, as if we might otherwise have had a different election result. I recall some of the blame being attributed to me as if there should have been a greater debate on other aspects of the Government's programme such as the public finances. It was suggested that the Opposition got caught in the trap set by Fianna Fáil of having to discuss the economy during at least half the election campaign, as if it was the job of Fianna Fáil to plan how there could be a greater debate to help the other par ties get elected. There is a new kind of principle of falling on one's sword which I have not heard enunciated during a campaign for a number of years.Economics were discussed during much of the campaign. The terms of the stability and growth pact were discussed which highlighted the problems going forward, irrespective of what party is in power.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	301	One sound way to judge whether someone can deliver is to look at what they have done when given the chance in the past. In the case of the parties forming the Government, the record shows that we can meet the targets. At the risk of making those opposite feel uncomfortable, I believe it is worthwhile to go over this record. Since taking office in 1997, both parties in Government presided over one of the best economic performances in the world. During that period of office economic growth in GDP terms averaged around 10% per annum; real living standards and take home pay increased substantially; we put an end to forced emigration; over 300,000 new jobs were created; unemployment fell from over 10% to 4% in 2000; the long-term unemployment rate was cut by 80%; the economy became one of the most open and competitive in the world; and the public indebtedness dropped sharply from 74% of GDP in 1996 to around 34% now, giving us the second lowest national debt in Europe.In the area for which I am responsible, I undertook a series of major reforms and restructuring of the tax system. The first five budgets I introduced reduced both the standard rate and the top rate of income tax by six percentage points and replaced the personal and PAYE allowances with tax credits, making the system more equitable. Increases in those credits have ensured that 37% of income earners are now outside the tax net and 90% of the value of the current minimum wage is exempt from tax.On top of that, the budgets progressively widened the standard rate band, thereby reducing the numbers paying tax at the top rate; increased the incentive to work by reducing average tax rates, thus reducing the tax wedge which is now the lowest in the EU for those who are on average or low pay; increased the wage exemption limits for those aged 65 or over, thereby removing significant numbers of older citizens from the tax net;  reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, thereby encouraging people to release assets into the market and greatly increasing the tax yield; reformed the taxation of inheritance and gifts by introducing a single 20% CAT rate across the board, introducing a shared home exemption which was widely welcomed, simplifying the aggregation rules and abolishing probate tax; simplified the health expenses scheme, disposing of the need for complicated covenant arrangements and extended the relief to cover a wider range of family members as well as others such as those aged 65 and over and the incapacitated; amalgamated the existing tax reliefs for donations into one new simplified and expanded scheme, which now covers charities in general, second level schools and third level educational institutions as well as capital sports projects.It has rationalised and expanded the tax relief for third level fees and introduced relief at source for mortgage interest and medical insurance, aligned the income tax year with the calendar year and brought forward related benefit for budget day tax on social welfare changes. New pension arrangements for the self-employed have been introduced and other categories to give a person more control over their own pensions on retirement removing the obligation on them to purchase retirement annuities in all cases. Provision has been made for a phased reduction in corporation tax to 12.5% across the board for all corporate trading income by 2003.The Government ensured in its term of office that the Revenue Commissioners were provided with adequate resources to carry out their duties, both in terms of manpower and statutory powers. Specifically, in regard to powers, the Government introduced a number of measures to enhance the Revenue Commissioners' powers to enable them to obtain a greater range of information from third parties, to access bank accounts and to audit records of financial institutions. We have committed in the programme for Government to further address tax evasion and we will also deliver on that. I plan to further overhaul, reform and rationalise various aspects of the tax and revenue systems where that helps to simplify tax administration, assist the taxpayer in dealing with taxation, enable resources to be used more effectively and to better target tax resources towards achieving Government priorities.No matter how good the record of achievement is, there will always be challenges for the future. A key challenge to address is investment in infrastructure which we need to do to secure future growth. We need to invest to meet the demographic challenge of ageing and the implications this has for the cost, provision and structure of the public services going forward. Over the last five years the Government committed significant resources to capital investment, especially to roads, public transport and housing.

Even with such a high level of investment in our infrastructure, more is needed to meet the growing needs of the economy and the new Government is committed to this.Deputy Hayes should note that pumping too many resources into the capital programme will have an effect, which we can point to over the last number of years. All one does is drive up inflation in that particular sector and one gets less return for one's buck, which is what has happened regarding some of the capital programme over two years. Resources were pumped in, but only the same pool was there to do the work and tender prices went up. There is another myth out there that needs to be exploded.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Accordingly, the programme for Government sets out ambitious and specific targets in areas such as transport and environmental services. Achievement of these targets will be assisted through the implementation of the infrastructure investment programme of the national development plan. Despite some misinformed commentary to the contrary, progress in rolling out the NDP infrastructure programme has been satisfactory. In particular, good progress has been made under the economic and social infrastructure programme of the plan with financial outturn well on target and significant physical output being recorded. In financial terms over the first three years of the plan, total investment under the economic and social infrastructure programme will amount to €10.2 billion, which is €140 million more than originally planned. The Exchequer and EU contribution over the same period will amount to €8.5 billion or €740 million more than originally planned.Particular attention was paid by the previous Government to the delivery on the ground of the NDP programme and a major innovation was the creation of the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development, including public private partnerships, chaired by the Taoiseach and supported by an interdepartmental team of senior officials.  This institutional structure, which will be continued by the new Administration, provides a powerful framework to address institutional, administrative, legal and other factors which impact on infrastructural delivery. In addition, the establishment of a Department of Transport responsible for major roads and public transport investment will enable a better and more integrated focus on delivery of investment in this key area.The roll out of the NDP infrastructural programme has resulted in projects of an unprecedented scale and size being constructed throughout the country, even with a number of factors which have intervened to limit progress. Construction industry inflation has been higher than anticipated at the outset of the plan and these higher costs have absorbed resources. Additional costs have also arisen in some cases as a result of respecification of projects as they moved from conception to planning, design and construction. Finally, delays have been encountered as a result of disruption due to foot and mouth disease and compensation of land owners. The programme for Government and the NDP are predicated on the continuation of stable macroeconomic policies and sound public finances. I am confident that if we adhere to this policy the resources will be delivered to enable the Government accord the necessary priority to progressing the infrastructure investment programme in the plan and in the programme for Government.I am proud to have established the National Pensions Reserve Fund and I welcome the positive support given to this initiative by the Fine Gael Party. In common with other industrialised countries, Ireland is set to experience a significant ageing of its population over the coming decades and this will give rise to a serious financial burden on the State. It will put a severe strain on the capacity of all Governments to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a "pay-as-you-go" basis. The purpose of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is to move from sole reliance on "pay-as-you-go" and to introduce part prefunding of our future liabilities. It is a long-term project from which we should not be deflected in the early years. The establishment fund will help to smooth the Exchequer burden arising from our additional pension commitments and introduces a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning. This is our nest egg for the future and we should not deploy it to meet short-term priorities. The ageing burden is an inevitable cost, not something we can avoid or dispel or over which we have any real measure of discretion, which is why the Government in its programme will continue to provide for it. That is a clear and firm commitment.The new programme for Government regards the delivery of improved public services as a priority. In particular, over the next five years the Government will focus its attention on health, education and social inclusion within the context of an effective public expenditure management  regime. To achieve these goals will require delivery of key results and a close look at the amount of input required to secure the desired outcome. The single biggest input in the public sector is staff and the cost of such staff resources. Obviously, we need a balanced way of relating output to input and pay systems in the public sector are not noted for such rationality and have exhibited many rigidities.Over the years Government sought ways of getting away from the rigidities of this system and at the time of the negotiation of the current Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government was determined that we could not continue with a system of dealing with pay claims on a piecemeal basis with groups attempting to leapfrog each other. A more orderly way of determining public service pay was needed. Arising out of these concerns the Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body to examine public service pay and to place the rates for the job in the public service within the context of the private sector and the economy as a whole. Importantly, from our perspective, the parties concerned agreed that historical, cross-sectoral relativities were incompatible with this initiative. This process represents a totally new approach. It is an independent examination and has been the most extensive examination of its kind ever carried out in this country and, indeed, would be regarded as comprehensive by international standards.When the Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 it was asked to report by end-June 2002. The report, I understand, will be delivered on time. The implementation of the report is to be the subject of negotiations between the public service employers and trade unions. These discussions will take place in the context of whatever arrangements emerge to succeed the PPF. The Government will also have to consider the cost implications of the recommendations in the report in determining its approach to those discussions. At this stage we do not know what these will be. Benchmarking will establish appropriate levels of pay and the budgetary outcome will determine the levels of increase we can afford in any one year.If the public is to get maximum value from their taxes which pay for the increases, ongoing modern work practices and flexibilities must be part of the resultant package. We have to proceed on the basis that a euro devoted to higher pay rates is a euro not available otherwise to improve services. Unless public servants can deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness, the taxpaying public will rightly ask why should they pay more unless they get more in terms of the quality of public services.Any five year programme is dependent on the medium term outlook for the economy. We have the capacity to deliver healthy growth rates provided we continue to secure our competitiveness. This will be an important challenge, made all the  more relevant by the recent appreciation of the euro. As a small open economy with a very large reliance on trade and foreign investment, our fortunes depend very much on the international outlook. They also depend on us maintaining a competitive economy in terms of wage costs, productivity, quality of goods and reliability of services. It also means having a competitive and efficient domestic sector providing services and inputs for the more internationally exposed sector of the economy. One important area of that domestic sector is insurance costs and the programme for government proposes specific measures to address the problems that have arisen, which can affect our growth performance. I expect that growth this year will live up to expectations after a slow start in the first half of the year. Achieving this relies on sustained expansion in major international economies. Despite the continuing uncertainty on the part of some commentators, the consensus view is the US economy is in recovery and first quarter US GDP data supports this.In the final analysis the Government will be judged on its record. The programme for Government will provide the means to make this judgment and the electorate will once again in five years time have a clear basis on which to exercise its judgment, the only one that counts in the end. I urge the House to support the amended motion.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and to comment on the Government's programme. I listened with great interest to the Minister's contribution and he was wrong on most things. He began by invoking a mandate he claims he got from the people. The public gave Fianna Fáil 81 seats while half a dozen independent Fianna Fáil Members were available to form a Fianna Fáil Government but the Taoiseach decided to surrender that mandate from the people to a small group known as the Progressive Democrats and offer its members positions at Cabinet and junior ministerial level. It is a curious version of a mandate to go to the people, secure enough seats to form a Government and then decide to give them away unless one is like Deputy McCreevy, the Trojan horse for centre right thinking in the outgoing Administration, who was able to deliver Fianna Fáil, the republican party, once again to the Progressive Democrats.There is nothing very republican about the programme that has been published and it does not refer to the concept of citizenship. The Minister referred to his five previous budgets, which he is hoping to publish together as a personal testament of his contribution to society, and in each one he deepened the inequalities in society. He gave as much to those at the top of the tax net as he did to those at the bottom. There was an interesting little omission in his contribution as he never referred to housing.After five years during which the country  experienced the largest budget surpluses in its history, the health service has moved into crisis, not solely for financial reasons but for administrative reasons as well, while in regard to housing the combined income of a couple who both earn the average industrial wage, and who are forced to enter the economy and cannot stay at home to become involved in child rearing, is still not sufficient to purchase a house. When the final statistics are published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the total number of people on housing lists will probably be between 50,000 and 60,000.There is an interesting scenario in the private rented sector where tenants seek the same rights that Michael Davitt sought at the end of the nineteenth century, including security of tenure, fairness in rent and the right to pass on a tenancy. Two years ago a report on the housing market was published, which dealt with the issue of tenants but it was not addressed by the previous Government. The legislation promised in the new programme has not been brought forward. However, the Minister adopted the first Bacon report, which addressed the issue of speculation in housing to an extent. Outside opinion suggests it was a factor in house price inflation but the Minister decided to reduce capital gains tax on speculative gains on house sales, the most crucial area of all. Wave them off in one report and then wave them back again.I have spent 24 years as an academic but what I have to say is not academic at all. It is a scandal in a republic to have allowed the heart to be torn out of the economy by allowing speculators to destroy the housing market. I am not elected to the House to stand up and make a contribution that is a cross between a racing analysis and a weather forecast on the economy. I am asked to speak about political economy and I challenge the Minister on the assumptions that guide his thinking and that of the Government.Are all matters to be decided by supply and demand in the marketplace through a commodified and depeopled version of the economy, such as in health where public private partnerships fill gaps the State cannot or where people are permitted to enter one sector of the housing market and write off their tax liability because of the number of houses they own? The Minister introduced these measures and it is not something of which to be proud. People who owned ten or 12 houses when the previous Government took office now own 20 and 30 and on it goes. Is that something of which to be proud? Is it very republican? What does it tell us about citizenship?It tells us something interesting about the Government's approach to housing and health, which is its antipathy to a rights-based approach to legislation. Centre right Ministers believe everything can be commodified. It is a case of the commodified version of the economy ruled by the marketplace in terms of supply and demand. Is there anything that is not a matter of such commodification and laws of the marketplace?For example, Ireland signed up to various United Nations covenants and in some there is a discussion on the forward movement of human rights thinking, which is to add social and economic rights to civil and political rights. Ireland's performance in this area was discussed recently at a UN verifying committee meeting in Geneva. The Government was asked to report on its view about such thinking. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution reported negatively in 1996 on the inclusion of social and economic rights beyond the right to shelter, housing, health and so on and argued that such rights interfered with the property provisions of the Constitution.The Labour Party attempted to introduce a Bill in 1998 which would have merged social and economic rights with civil and political rights. When Ireland was asked to report in Geneva recently the UN verifying committee flatly rejected the Government's case against social and economic rights. The Government repeated the argument it used in 1999 for the second periodic report this year and this was bluntly rejected by the committee, which "took pains in its concluding observations to point out that when a state voluntarily ratifies an international human rights instrument it, thereby, assumes the legal obligation to give the relevant international law full effect in the domestic legal order".The programme for Government, therefore, does not accept rights in terms of housing, health, disability and international covenants to which Ireland has appended its name. In 1999 and 2002 the verifying committee of the UN in Geneva criticised Ireland for its approach in this regard. The programme of Government for the next five years does not accept rights and, therefore, is not based on a theory of citizenship but on a depeopled version of the economy. According to the Government anything good that has happened is an achievement on the part of the Minister while anything negative is the achievement of the international trade winds that are blowing.I have heard of all of this previously and there is nothing new or original in the programme. However, the agreed programme does not have a title. It has a little demented harp with the republican party written underneath on one side of the cover while the Pairtí Daonlathach is printed on the other side. It has been described by the Minister as a model of clarity. However, for example, on page six it contains aspirational "stuff", as a younger generation would call it. The programme states "Within the next 12 months we will publish a specific programme to ensure the expansion of social, cultural and economic co-operation with all the countries that are joining the European Union". This is coming from a Government that abolished the post of Minister for culture, is unable to say which Minister of State responsible for mushrooms or fish will attend the Culture Ministers Council in Brussels and was so committed to opposing the very concept of culture that it regarded broadcasting as a commodity as well. It takes neck, with which I have always credited  Fianna Fáil and for which I admired it. When I think of the "McDowellisms" that will now be at the heart of the Fianna Fáil thinking, many decent Fianna Fáil people should be asking questions.Another piece of clarity appears on page seven: "We will vigorously pursue actions to ensure that everyone is tax compliant."  That is about on the level of saying we will take steps that will astonish you. The language in this programme, this mish-mash thing of bits and pieces, gets worse. It blatantly tells untruths on page eight where it suggests "we support the positive role of the community employment scheme", when the Tánaiste already abolished more community employment scheme places by 2002 than was agreed in the cutback for 2004. It moves on to the question of the statutory redundancy scheme in relation to conditions of employment. It states: "they will be examined with a view to implementation."  Why else would they be examined? What does that mean? I do not wish to bore the House but on insurance and road safety it states: "Work on the penalty points system will be completed to ensure its implementation at an early date."  Like hens laying eggs, they are hoping that some day it will happen.There are very interesting points in relation to Iarnród Éireann. It states: "We will establish Iarnród Éireann as an independent State company in its own right with full management autonomy."  There is no reference to the disposal of the assets of CIE. This can be deconstructed to mean "We will break up CIE."  On the issue of the sale of State assets, the sale of what the people own, to private speculators who have always known to which party to go, there is obvious disagreement. There is a curious statement that: "It will be considered on a non-ideological basis", but what could be more ideological than grabbing what you do not own and selling it, which is the Progressive Democrats view? Then, in order to keep the Fianna Fáil punters happy and to keep the common blushes, if there is such a thing, from reaching a dangerous level, "Each proposal will be examined on a case-by-case basis."Incineration is in. I love the idea on litter. The programme states: "We will ensure that all Government and other State agencies fulfil their obligations under the Litter Pollution Act."  What else would they be expected to do? Break it? This is like saying Wednesday usually follows Tuesday with a good expectation that Friday will be two days later. This was described by the Minister for Finance as clear, specific and targeted.

On page 17, there is a commitment to the up-to-date nuclear emergency plans, and I believe the iodine tablets have arrived so I suppose that should be noted as an instant success. It states: "We will implement a  full package of reforms in rented accommodation arising from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector."  Where is the legislation in relation to any of the certainties that people were looking for?There is a kind of seediness in relation to other areas, including education. On page 23 the programme states: "We will ensure that every pupil participates in a programme designed to increase understanding of the value and role of enterprise."  This is in a 34-page document that does not contain the word "music" once. It offers a prospect of that kind of mentality that children could not be safe from the notion that everything had to be commodified. There is no reference to the huge need for music education. It would have been a simple old Fianna Fáil value in the past. It would have said something such as that every child would have an opportunity to learn to swim or to play a musical instrument. That is all gone. It is a huckster's charter rather than a programme for Government. There is the grandiosity of the line such as, "We are committed to moving forward on the basis of implementing our highly ambitious children strategy."  I ask the Lord to save us from their ambitions.I imagine the Minister for Finance is very happy because there is not a single commitment in this that could mean anything or that could embarrass him in the slightest. The Department of Finance will be happy. He will be well able to say that there was nothing in the programme that was not delivered because it was not included from the beginning.It is time we debated economics and the assumptions that are underlying these policies and programmes. It is becoming more urgent as there has been a shift in the political spectrum in France to a centre right Government. What have centre right Governments to offer?

He knows where I stand on this. I challenge him to say if he is accepting a basis of universal access or rights in any area – education, health, environment, safety or participation. If he does not accept the rights-based approach, how will the Government implement the Good Friday Agreement when that agreement will carry many of the rights from the British legislation which are flowing directly from a rights base?Does he really believe in the commodification of everything in relation to the housing market? Is the Government not concerned at what is happening in relation to housing ? A recent housing survey from the Department of the Environment and Local Government produced figures on the number of people who would be regarded as not qualifying for affordable housing. In Carlow, the figure was as high as 27% to 28.9%; Cork, 33.9%  to 36%; and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, 53% to 57%. In a case where speculation has been allowed to put more than half the population in a particular area out of the category of earning affordable housing, how can the Minister say that he is running the economy properly? Housing is a social good and is a critical element in human community and social development.An assessment of housing needs should be carried out by an independent multi-disciplinary body. Land is the central resource required for housing and the State should move through public land banks and give constitutional support to that if necessary. Housing policies should be tenure-neutral rather than biased in favour of single options. Legislation should be enacted to ensure that housing is a universal right without qualification. If we had an acceptance of a rights-based approach in health and housing and in the basic matters of citizenship from a republican party, I would be perfectly willing to debate with the Minister to what his conversations with the Minister, Deputy McDowell, had led him. I believe that the arrival of this rump in the Government represents a disaster for the next five years. It will be disastrous in several different areas. The way in which they can turn their faces against social need is something that fills me with horror. How can the Minister keep describing the economy in terms of European performance and GDP when the economy can appear to be doing well at a superficial level while people are doing badly? Even those whose tax burden has been reduced, which I acknowledge, have been put into a prison from early morning until night in which they must find child care. They are leading deeply unhappy lives in a depeopled economy. That is why this programme for Government is a disastrous mishmash and a continuation of previous policies.

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport made a recommendation prior to the general election that maintenance should be carried out on the River Shannon. If that took place it would be the first major maintenance carried out on the river since the early 1900s when the country was still under British rule. Since that time Bord na Móna has put silt into the Shannon from its peat extraction, while Coillte has put silt into the river from forestry developments and drainage on land it has planted. Local authorities have silted the Shannon because untreated sewage was and still is going into the river and its tributaries. The Office of Public Works, for which the Minister for Finance has direct responsibility, has put further debris into the Shannon through its arterial drain age programme. Over the last 100 years we have seen continual silting of the Shannon to such an extent that land now exists between Shannonbridge and Meelick which did not exist 40 or 50 years ago. This poses a huge threat to agriculture and tourism.As everyone is aware, the Shannon is one of the major tourist assets in the country but continual silting threatens the viability of cruisers on the river. There are also thousands of acres in the Shannon basin which are under three to four feet of water due to the lack of release of water and the heavy rainfall of recent weeks.I seek an allocation of funding to be set aside to carry out annual maintenance of the River Shannon. The Minister will say it is not his Department's responsibility but at the end of the day he is the one with the money and he can call the shots. Funding must be set aside for this and a commitment must be made to allocate that funding on an annual basis; then we can decide who will carry out the work. It is vital that someone takes responsibility for the maintenance and control of the Shannon. At this point 20 different agencies have responsibility for the Shannon in one form or another. The buck must stop with one individual and one Department, but that is not happening at present. The only way it will happen is if the Minister takes the bull by the horns and puts the funding in place. Then we will get this sorted out.

A number of farmers in the Shannon basin are in severe difficulties at present because much of the land where they get fodder for wintering cattle has been destroyed and there is no way they will get a crop later this summer. They will be in severe financial difficulty come the end of the year and I ask the Minister for Finance, through the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to put a package in place specifically for that small number of farmers in the Shannon basin. I urge the Minister to set aside funding to deal with this problem.I hope the Minister can find a mechanism to ensure that at last there will be some kind of maintenance. We are not talking about draining the Shannon but carrying out regular maintenance on the river. As that is not happening, the viability of both family farms and tourism assets in the region are threatened.

I did not congratulate him earlier.While some tributaries of the Shannon have been drained, a drainage scheme has not been undertaken on the River Shannon itself. I regret, therefore, that the Commissioners of Public  Works have no powers to undertake maintenance of the river.Flooding of the Shannon basin is a long-standing problem and is due primarily to natural causes. The gradient of the river is very flat and it has inadequate depth and width in critical areas. This results in a slow-flowing river which is not capable of discharging all the water flowing through it at times of particularly heavy rainfall with the result that flooding occurs. There is some evidence that rainfall has been increasing in intensity in recent years.There have been several studies aimed at finding a solution to this flooding problem. It is generally accepted that the report presented by Mr. L.E. Rydell of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the definitive study of the problem. This report advanced a number of possible options for alleviation of Shannon flooding and recommended that further study be given to what it considered the most promising approaches. These were a so-called summer relief scheme and a full scheme. The summer relief scheme would aim to eliminate summer flooding and reduce the extent and duration of winter flooding. It is estimated that the present day cost of such a scheme would be €750 million. The full scheme would have a present day cost of €1 billion. Both schemes would also have significant negative environmental implications. Unfortunately, against this background, the likelihood is that the solution to the flooding problems in the Shannon basin will not be found in arterial drainage works.The last Dáil requested the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to consider "issues relating to the management of the River Shannon". The committee in its final report in March recommended that the task of co-ordinating the management of the Shannon river catchment be assigned to the Western Development Commission and that the necessary legislative and other changes to give effect to this be implemented. As I indicated in response to a parliamentary question from the Deputy earlier today, I am arranging to bring the report to the attention of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I assure the House that the Office of Public Works will co-operate fully with the Western Development Commission or any other agency in any effort to alleviate the Shannon river flooding problem.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I too congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment. I also congratulate Deputy Martin on his reappointment as Minister for Health and I wish him well.The Mayo branch of the Arthritis Foundation of Ireland has been campaigning for the last eight years on this issue. I congratulate Mary Healy, Helen McGrath, Rachel Tolan and the hardworking committee for campaigning for the last eight years for a rheumatology service for Mayo. There  is one rheumatologist in the Western Health Board area and he also covers Clare. It is outrageous that one person is expected to cover that area, given that thousands of people are waiting to be assessed and there are 14,500 people with arthritis in Mayo alone. Does the Minister think it is fair that people from Achill in north Mayo must travel to Galway – a 200 mile round trip – to see a man who is overworked and overloaded? He cannot deal with all the patients because he cannot cover Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and parts of Clare. I have contacted the health board and the Minister about this, but the health board tells me it is awaiting funding and approval from the Department. The consultant himself is overworked and patients are coming to see me about this.The Minister should think about people with arthritis. They have pains in their arms and legs and their families are left to look after them. We should put ourselves in that position, although it is fine for us because we can afford VHI and get instant service. These people are depending on the health services and they are waiting in pain. Their families come to me and ask what I, the Government and the health board are doing about this. It is wrong that 14,500 people in Mayo alone must depend on one individual; that is impossible for any person. I compliment the consultant, as he is under stress. He has contacted the committee and said he is looking for further appointments. I seek a rheumatologist for Mayo General Hospital to deal with the Mayo problem. I realise the Western Health Board is in crisis because the chief executive had a recent meeting with the health board where it was pointed out that it is four months over budget. I am sure the Minister and his Department are putting tremendous pressure on the health board to bring its budget into line. If it does so, this matter will not be a priority with the health board.I call on the Minister, the Department and the Western Health Board to immediately appoint for the Western Health Board region three rheumatologists, one of whom should be for Mayo General Hospital alone. We do not want to share that person. Given that there are 14,500 people in Mayo suffering from arthritis there is a need for such an appointment.Recently I attended a public meeting at which outrage was expressed. One horror story followed another about people waiting for appointments and waiting three or four hours to be seen by a consultant. Those people may get only five minutes with a consultant because that person is under pressure given the number of people he has to see in one day. I ask the Minister to resolve this problem once and for all. It can be resolved. What we seek is a commitment from the Minister and the Department of Health and Children to provide funding. We seek a commitment from the Western Health Board to make these appointments immediately with the permission of the Minister.The committee which has worked hard over  the years is frustrated and upset. At the public meeting I saw the people who are affected. Yet they are out there fighting to get the necessary service for everybody else in rural areas. Why can some of these services not be brought to rural areas? Why should our people always have to go to the cities? Why not make this a specialty in Mayo General Hospital rather than ask 100 people to travel from Belmullet or Aghleam to Galway, which is 120 miles away, or 240 miles round trip. Those people travel home in the evening with pain in their hands and arms without having got the service they needed from the consultant who is overworked. It is not possible for one human being to look after Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and parts of Clare, given that there are 14,500 people affected by arthritis in County Mayo alone.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I avail of this opportunity to wish you all the best in your position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter on the adjournment. As the Deputy is aware, the provision of health services at Mayo General Hospital is the statutory responsibility in the first instance of the Western Health Board. The board has informed me that there is one consultant rheumatologist at present in the Western Health Board based at Merlin Park Regional Hospital and services for patients from the Mayo area are provided by this consultant.I understand from the Western Health Board that the provision of a consultant rheumatologist at Mayo General Hospital is being considered in the context of the development of the orthopaedic services in Mayo. The board is preparing a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services. This strategic plan is at a a very advanced stage and will be placed before the Western Health Board for consideration and adoption within the next two to three months. The further development of rheumatology services in the Western Health Board region will be considered in the context of additional funding available for acute hospital service developments in 2003 and the associated competing priorities.In recent years there has been a significant investment in the development of Mayo General Hospital, both in developing its infrastructure and in the provision of additional services. There are now 800 staff working at the hospital and its annual expenditure is approximately €50 million. Phase II of the hospital's development was completed recently and includes: a new accident and emergency department, a medical assessment unit, a geriatric assessment unit, an obstetric and delivery suite, CT scanning facilities, a new helicopter landing facility, an improved mortuary and post-mortem room, a new information technology system, and a new administration and medical records department. Overall the phase II development of the hospital cost $48 million. Before phase II started there were 240 in-patient beds at the hospital. The total in-patient beds is  now 317, including the 12 additional beds I funded under the bed capacity initiative which I understand opened earlier this year. This represents an increase of over 30% in bed capacity.Specific funding of $2.9 million has been provided this year to allow for the opening of the new orthopaedic beds at the hospital. This new 33 bed orthopaedic unit will be a particularly valuable addition to the hospital and will be of great benefit to the people of County Mayo. The development of orthopaedic services in Mayo is an important addition to the Western Health Board's regional orthopaedic service.An Agreed Programme for Government provides for significant new developments in acute hospital services. I am fully committed to implementing such improvements in services over the coming years.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I am grateful to you for allowing me raise this matter which is of great urgency, causing an enormous amount of distress to parents. I am glad the Minister is present. I wish him well in his new period of office. I hope he can respond to two essential points. The first is that waiting lists now exist, for the first time in 21 years, for services at the Brothers of Charity in Galway for new born infants. When the election campaign began there were 19 families affected, now there are 21 or, perhaps, more. Many more are obviously holding back because they know about the waiting list.We all agree that for new born infants with intellectual disabilities the earliest intervention achieves the best results. One can appreciate the anxiety of parents who are uncertain or unsure about the prognosis of their child. Unfortunately, what has happened is that the demand has expanded and the staff has not increased. When all 17 of us standing for election in Galway West attended meetings we were asked questions. Members of the Government parties, both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, accepted a rights-based approach, but such an approach is not being implemented where one divides funding for such services on a county basis proportionately between, for example, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. If the Minister wishes to implement a rights-based approach it must be done on a needs basis within a rights model. That means there is an immediate need for resources. A compromise, such as has been suggested to those on the waiting list that they will be dealt with in September, simply adds to the delay, given that there will be another waiting list in September.The second point, which is very important,  relates to legislation in the courts and the Government's Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. That refers to the case of young adults, perhaps three sharing a bungalow, as reported in The Irish Times yesterday. The Brothers of Charity have provided a purpose-built day care recreational centre which would enable them to leave the bungalows and be active during the day. These are young adults approaching their early 20s. The facility is built but no funding has been made available for either its equipment or staffing. This means that the 22 young adults involved, 12 of whom are autistic, are confined, three to a bungalow of 1,200 square feet. Yet there is a building available which could be used and would be of assistance to them. I ask the Minister to intervene immediately to ensure these issues are resolved.The argument that this is a matter primarily for the Western Health Board is unacceptable. I have advocated a rights-based approach based on the needs of the person. If it is a competition between services provided within the health board area and on a geographic basis, this severely damages any rights basis for one's policy. I ask the Minister to address these two issues as a matter of urgency.It will be perceived as cynical for all candidates standing for election to attend very emotional meetings, listen, in the first instance, to all the parents and promise to be of assistance and, on the second issue, visit the facility which is built but not equipped or staffed and make commitments. The time has come to put these matters right. I hope the Minister will respond positively to the case I have made on the two issues.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position in this regard.Significant additional funding has, in recent years, been invested in services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1997 and 2002, the previous Government provided additional revenue and capital funding amounting to nearly €312 million. Specific funding has been targeted to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1998 and 2002, €14.6 million in additional funding was provided to expand these services. This includes assessment and diagnostic services, early intervention, pre-school and outreach support for school children.While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other  possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. It is a matter, however, for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.In response to my concern regarding the current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The study, published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades requiring a significant increase in training places. The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated additional training places for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive for allied health professionals on behalf of the health boards. These measures, together with continued investment in the services, will greatly assist in delivering an enhanced level of support in these areas to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism and their families.Responsibility for the provision of health related support services including early intervention services to children with special needs in County Galway is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board. Between 1998 and 2002 additional revenue funding amounting to €1.664 million was allocated to the Western Health Board for the enhancement of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism.I am aware of the concerns expressed by families in the County Galway area. A senior official from my Department met with representatives of the board and the families to discuss those concerns. The Western Health Board has informed my Department that the 21 children who are waiting on services will be placed in September. I also understand that it is the board's intention to undertake a review of all the early childhood services in the region.I assure the Deputy that I will take a personal interest in this and my Department will continue to work closely with the board regarding ongoing development of these and other support services for persons with disabilities in the western region to bring about an enhanced level of support for those availing of these services. I will follow up the issue regarding young adults to see what additional measures we can take.

The grave nature of this development cannot be underestimated. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue in the Dáil by way of matter on the Adjournment. I urge the Minister and the Government to consider other ways in which this House can express our unanimous rejection of this latest outrage from British Nuclear Fuels and the British Government. We should create this opportunity before the summer recess.The seeds of this debacle were sown three years ago. The highly dangerous and radioactive MOX fuel in question was transported from Sellafield to Japan in 1999. Upon its arrival in the Far East, staff at BNFL admitted they had faked the materials safety records. The Japanese Minister for Trade and Industry described the affair as deplorable and said "Confidence in BNFL has been destroyed."  The end result was that the Japanese authorities ordered the British authorities to take back the deadly cargo. I would like to emphasise that this is a deadly cargo. It contains enough plutonium to create 50 nuclear bombs. Governments are protesting all along this cargo's likely route on its 18,000 mile journey from the port of Takahama to Barrow in Furness. The two vessels carrying the nuclear cargo, the Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal have been armed but will not have an armed escort. The danger of attack is obvious.The British Government has argued quite absurdly and outrageously that this shipment has nothing to do with operations at the MOX plant at Sellafield. This latest lie is an attempt by the British Government to slip out of its legal commitment under the United Nations International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea made last November in Hamburg. However, the return of the MOX fuel is one of five conditions set by the Japanese Government and Electrical Utilities for new MOX contracts with Britain. This deadly transport is, therefore, vital for the future of British Nuclear Fuels and if successful could lead to tens of thousands of kilos of plutonium being shipped out of Sellafield over the next ten to 20 years.This shipment must be stopped not only for its own sake but in order to thwart the future of the MOX plant which the Irish Government and people have rejected. This is an act of international piracy and sabotage by the British Government and we in this House must vehemently and unanimously oppose it. We must join with other Governments around the world to stop what is a grave danger and what will be but the herald of even greater dangers to come.I would like to pose a couple of questions. Why in the face of the unanimous opposition of the Irish people as represented by the Irish Government and significant opposition in Britain did BNFL proceed with its MOX plant? Is it not the case that the plant processes nuclear fuel from all  over the world thus creating greater traffic of this material on the Irish Sea? Why did BNFL falsify its quality control standards for MOX fuel leading to the sending back of this cargo of fuel from Japan? How can anyone trust BNFL when a State like Japan, which uses nuclear power, cannot do so? I strongly urge the Minister and his colleagues in Government to significantly increase their efforts and to join with an ever widening international community in concerted action in opposition to this planned transportation of deadly cargo into Irish waters and all the dangers that presents for us in the immediate future and years to come.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Successive Irish Governments have protested to the British Government about Sellafield and these protests and contacts are well documented in the House. The Government will maintain opposition to the continued operation and any expansion of Sellafield and will continue to pursue its campaign to bring about the closure of the plant.The shipment of nuclear material to and from Sellafield, which is principally associated with Sellafield reprocessing activities, is among the many concerns of the Government about Sellafield, as is the recently commissioned MOX plant. The Government has strongly and consistently opposed the MOX plant. As the House will be aware, our concerns are now being pursued at a higher level; in this regard, the Government has initiated legal action against the United Kingdom under the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.The commissioning of the MOX plant will add further to the multiplicity of operations at Sellafield. It will also result in an increase in the movement of radioactive materials and of plutonium in particular. The shipment of such materials through the Irish Sea represents an unacceptable risk to the environment of Ireland and the health and economic well-being of its population. There is now also the enhanced risk of the shipments being the target of a terrorist attack or the materials being diverted into the hands of terrorists.The concerns of the Government and the public regarding the use of the Irish Sea for shipments of nuclear materials have been made known on many occasions to the UK. My colleague, the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is primarily responsible for the marine environment and safety at sea, is concerned to ensure that the vessels carrying such cargo do not pass through waters under Irish jurisdiction. Currently there are assurances from the UK authorities that they will not do so. The UK authorities have previously stressed that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year to ensure  that the highest possible levels of safety are applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them.Arrangements are in place with both the UK and France that Ireland will be notified in advance of shipment dates in regard to transport of nuclear materials, the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details. The Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources has also been advised that, in the event that a shipping route involves passage through the territorial waters of any State, the State involved would be notified in advance.In relation to the possible shipment of nuclear materials in the coming months, the outcome to date of the legal proceedings against the UK, under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, imposed, by order, obligations of co-operation on the UK. This order places on the UK a requirement for the exchange of information and construction of appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment, pending the hearing of the substantive case by an arbitration  tribunal early next year. This tribunal will consider a number of issues that Ireland regards as essential to protecting the marine environment of the Irish Sea, including the increase in the transportation of nuclear materials arising from commissioning of the MOX plant.The order was an important achievement for Ireland. It requires the UK to co-operate with Ireland to construct measures for a safe environment in the Irish Sea. My Department has continued to press the UK in particular on the shipment of MOX fuel from Japan. Assurances have also been sought that the precautions taken for such a shipment uphold the UK's obligations under the 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and the various codes of the International Maritime Organisation regarding the shipment of radioactive materials.I assure the Deputy and the House that we are continuing to monitor developments and are in constant contact with UK authorities on this matter.The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 June 2002.

The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday, 10 June.The National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited section 8 inquiries are continuing. These reports are expected to be submitted to the High Court in the near future. As in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the question of whether the reports are published is entirely a matter for the High Court.One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

I have impressed on IDA Ireland the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country. The day-to-day work of promoting Ireland as an investment location continues apace.The focus of IDA Ireland over the coming months and years will be on high quality new investment that is in keeping with the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy. In addition, IDA will continue to work closely with existing clients to upgrade the value of their products and services into higher order functions such as research and development. Many recent job losses are part of an ongoing process of adjustment, whereby activities and hence jobs at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out, as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. In 2000 IDA Ireland negotiated nearly 40% of all new jobs in salary ranges above €31,700. The agency is working to ensure that overseas companies in Ireland are engaged in the kind of high value activity which is sustainable in the long-term.

After intense negotiations, a proposal was agreed involving significant changes in work practices and voluntary redundancy for 50 people. There was reason to believe that this agreement would secure the survival of the plant.When the company failed to secure sufficient orders from customers at satisfactory prices a final decision to close the plant was taken. I described the announcement at the time as a blow to all concerned, all the more so as there was reason to believe that the plant would survive after agreement on the restructuring plan. At the time I also acknowledged the determined efforts of the LRC to facilitate the survival of the plant.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The Government approved the draft scheme of a Bill to implement the recommendations of the review group on auditing last December. This legislation will include provisions to reform the regulation of and rules governing the accounting and auditing profession. Most significantly it will establish the Irish auditing and accounting supervisory authority on a statutory basis to supervise the regulation of the accountancy profession by the professional accountancy bodies.The collapse of Enron in the US lead to fundamental questioning of the practices of the auditing and accounting profession, auditor independence, the quality of accounting standards and corporate governance structures within companies. The Bill, which is at advanced stage of drafting by the parliamentary counsel, contains provisions relating to all of these concerns.In the light of the Enron affair my Department, in consultation with the interim board of IAASA, revisited the provisions in the draft Bill to ensure that the auditing and corporate governance failures associated with the Enron case are adequately dealt with in it. I am satisfied that this is the case in the light of information available on the collapse of Enron at this stage.As well as the specific provisions in the legislation that will bring much greater transparency to the relationship between auditors and their clients, IAASA will also have specific powers to monitor the rules and standards of the professional accountancy bodies in relation to auditor independence to ensure that they are achieving their stated objectives and that they continue to be at the forefront of best international practice. For example, IAASA, if it considers it appropriate, will be able to compel accountancy bodies to amend their rules and standards in the light of the findings of the ongoing investigations in the US in relation to the role of Enron's auditors or any other developments at national or international level.

The balance of approximately 56 workers were laid off towards the end of April.More than two-thirds of the former workforce have already found alternative employment in the area.

Together the member states and the European Parliament have set out to have the necessary legislation fully implemented by 2005.Specific steps taken already in relation to insurance are, earlier this year, adoption of the Directives on solvency margins for life and non-life insurance undertakings. A specific step currently under examination is the proposed directive on insurance mediation. In all of these the Irish Government is participating constructively.

It has begun site development works at its new business and technology park in Drogheda where it has secured planning permission for a number of new buildings. It has also applied for planning permission for five new advance buildings at Finnabair Business Park in Dundalk.Another IDA client, Galen Pharmaceuticals, is awaiting the outcome of a third party planning appeal, to begin construction of a new formulation facility in Ardee. The agency is also actively promoting the vacant Tellabs building in Drogheda and the vacant Xerox and AFL buildings in Dundalk.Enterprise Ireland, the industrial agency which deals with indigenous industry, as part of its regional strategy launched in 2001, is committed to driving growth in enterprise, and thereby jobs in the regions, with particular emphasis on the counties in the BMW region. In 2002 Enterprise Ireland aims to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW region including County Louth: approximately 25% of EI clients are currently located in the BMW region.

This process is intended to target and provide appropriate supports for those people, who because of age, literacy or other barriers are unlikely to succeed in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market.Following the recent conclusion of detailed discussions with the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and FÁS on matters relating to implementation I hope to be in position to announce the launch of this new initiative in the near future.

I expect to present to Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, the report of the interdepartmental implementation group in the near future. I also confirm that I received the report recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by Government.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 126 and 127 together.I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many businesses are facing and that it is undermining enterprise and job creation.The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for insurance companies. EU law prevents me from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks these companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of risk.The Agreed Programme for Government contains a series of measures aimed at tackling the high cost of insurance, particularly motor and employer liability insurance. These measures include the implementation of the 67 recommendations of the MIAB report, many of which have the potential to impact favourably on employer liability insurance as well; and the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Substantial progress has been made in relation to securing new investment in north Dublin.IDA Ireland has been actively engaged in this work and the marketing of vacated premises in Clonshaugh is continuing. IDA Ireland has advised me that three new investment projects are at the final stages of negotiations. These projects will, over a short time, deliver very significant new quality jobs in the area and I hope that announcements can be made in the near future.Some significant recruitment has taken place in other north Dublin IDA Ireland assisted companies. For example, Hertz in Swords has just completed recruitment of 250 people, Forest Laboratories has increased its levels of employment by 36 in Clonshaugh and Swords Laboratories (Bristol Myers Squibb) is well advanced in recruiting 350 staff for their expansion project in Swords and their new €400 million pharmaceutical facility at Blanchardstown. Bayer Diagnostics has agreed to invest in a new development centre at Swords with the prospect of up to 50 additional positions being created.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The report referred to by the Deputy has not yet been completed. I expect it to be available within the next two to three weeks. It was commissioned with the objective of scientifically assessing to what extent the introduction of the euro was availed of to unjustifiably increase prices. I am aware of public concerns which have been expressed in that regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	344	In my capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the previous Government, I kept my Department's strategy statement under regular review. Progress in implementing it was reflected in my Department's annual reports, the most recent of which was published in May. I intend to continue this process of regular review.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Discussions on a proposal for a directive on working conditions for temporary agency workers between the social partners at European Level, ETUC and UNICE, under the provisions of the Social Protocol, began in June 2000. After 11 months of discussion agreement could not be reached due to the inability to agree on how agency workers pay and conditions should be established. Employers' representatives wanted them to be determined in comparison to other agency workers while the unions' representatives wanted such comparisons to be made with the permanent employees in the place of work in which the agency worker was placed.The initiative then fell to Commissioner Diamantopoulou – EU Commissioner for Social Affairs and Employment – to attempt to move the agenda forward. The European Commission published its formal proposal on 20 March and provided that after a period of six weeks an agency worker could compare himself-herself with the employee in the end-user company.At a meeting of the Social Affairs Questions Group held in Brussels on 11 June an initial discussion took place on the Commission's proposal. All member states presented their views. The majority expressed a willingness to find a balance between the need for protection of temporary workers and flexibility for enterprises. Member states sought clarification on a number of Articles contained in the proposal. Ireland raised its objection to the six week period and proposed that a longer period should apply before an agency worker could compare himself-herself with the employee in the end-user company. It is expected that discussion on the draft proposal will continue throughout the second half of this year both in the social affairs questions group and the European Parliament, under the EU co-decision process.A further meeting is scheduled for 25 June when detailed scrutiny of each article will get under way.

Details of the Directives, including, in so far as it has been decided, the proposed transposition instruments, are available on my Departments website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives.A letter of formal notice, under Article 226 of the Treaty, has been issued by the European Commission in the case of one and a reasoned opinion in the case of another of the outstanding Directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed.I am satisfied that my Department is giving all due priority to the task of implementing the provisions of EU directives, in light of available resources.

Matters arising from this responsibility are a day-to-day function of the authority.Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by and obtainable from the authority.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The commitment in the programme for Government to encourage a better spread of jobs throughout the country is underpinned by the provisions also contained in the programme relating to ensuring balanced regional development. This chapter sets out an extensive list of policy initiatives which will be pursued in the coming period.The relative position of regions, in terms of employment and other variables such as GDP per head, is a very significant determinant of policy, both at EU and national level. These factors determine the focus of policy on matters such as EU Structural Funds and State Aid to enterprise. For example, the maximum approved rate of grants to support new investment in manufacturing and internationally traded service industry in the period 2000 to 2006 for large firms is 40% in the Border, midland and western region and 17.5% in Dublin. The rate in the other four regions in Ireland is currently around 30% and will be around 20% for the period 2004 to 2006.Regional emphasis is a strong feature of the various programmes adopted under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and carried out through the Structural Fund Operational Programmes for that period. It is underpinned by the stronger regional emphasis which has been introduced into the work of agencies such as IDA and Enterprise Ireland. The IDA is committed to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the BMW region in the coming years, an objective which it is on target to achieve in the period to 2003.In 2002 Enterprise Ireland aims to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW region. In supporting the provision of incubator space in the institutes of technology, Enterprise Ireland has recently committed over €14 million to six colleges in the southern and eastern region and €7.9 million to four in the BMW area. Both agencies have re-focused their resources on regions outside Dublin, and particular account is taken of the needs of the regions in matters such as transport, roads and telecommunications infrastructure.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The insurance and competition sides in my Department are giving active consideration to having a consultancy study undertaken with a view to a vigorous examination of the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. Such a study would be reflective of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to remove unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy.In the specific case of motor insurance, the MIAB report made it clear that the market for private motor insurance was not competitive. The MIAB was of the view that the imperfect state of the market was such that consumers' concerns were unlikely to be allayed without an investigation by the Competition Authority. The then Minister of State at my Department with responsibility in the area of insurance, Deputy Noel Treacy, referred the MIAB report to the Competition Authority in April. The chairperson and a senior member of the authority met the MIAB last week to discuss the report.

It is confirmation that the important work of this office in ensuring compliance with company law is well under way.The establishment of this office is a major step in enhancing Ireland's reputation as a good place to do business and as a place that operates to the highest possible international standards of corporate governance. The material contained in its annual report for 2001 covers the activity of the director and his staff while the office was in an interim form and in the post establishment period between 28 November and 31 December 2001.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Last April I set up a group to carry out a comprehensive review of the redundancy payments scheme. Its membership comprises one representative from each of the following organisations: IBEC, CIF, the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Social and Family Affairs and two representatives from ICTU. The group is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department.The review group has the following terms of reference: to review the operation of the scheme funded from the Social Insurance Fund and operating on the basis of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2001; to identify the legislative, administrative and system requirements for a more effective, efficient, simpler and customer service driven scheme, adapted to an e-Government environment; to examine the benefits payable under the scheme and to develop options for Government and social partner consideration; and to report to me within four months with recommendations and costings of the various proposals. The group is working to schedule and I expect to receive its report by the end of July.An Agreed Programme for Government provides that the recommendations of the review will be examined with a view to implementation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I should point out, at the outset, that the provision of jobs is a  day-to-day matter for the development agencies and not one in which I as Minister have a direct function.As regards the agencies under my Department, and in particular Enterprise Ireland, projects in the BMW regions can attract more favourable funding across a range of financial supports from Enterprise Ireland than projects in other parts of Ireland. In 2002 it is EI's aim to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW regions. Approximately 25% of EI clients are located in the BMW region.Since January 2002 EI has paid a total of €160,184 in funding for projects in the north-west region, with a total of €535,603 having been approved in that same period. An example of a recent success, which EI supported, is the expansion of Transware Plc which will result in the creation of 290 jobs over the next five years, 60 of which are already in place at its Sligo base.Enterprise Ireland has also been involved in a wide range of activities which will have a considerable impact on the economy in the north-west, for example: a new community enterprise scheme, launched in April 2002; the proposed establishment of a number of technology hubs, termed "webworks"; and the investment of €95 million in 12 venture capital funds which will have a dedicated regional focus delivered through four of the funds.Over the past two years, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policy with a commitment to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. IDA Ireland confirmed its commitment to the north-west region in January 2002 when Sligo became one of three towns nationally to be recognised as growth centres for inward investment.A number of positive initiatives by IDA Ireland have resulted, the development of which continues in 2002, as follows:The two major projects recently announced by Abbott Ireland for the north-west region are progressing. The projects involve the re-development of the company's facility in Donegal Town with an investment of €65 million and also the development of a new Pharma project in Sligo with the creation of 190 new jobs.Ongoing investment at other IDA Ireland client companies such as Prumerica Systems Ireland Limited, PacifiCare Health Systems Ireland, MBNA, Kirchhoff Ireland, Boston Scientific Interventional Technologies and Claddagh Resources will all result in additional employment being created in the region.On the development of property in the region, the Letterkenny Business Park has been completed and plans are well advanced to extend this park. The Finisklin Business Park has been extended and plans are well advanced also for new lands in Sligo. IDA Ireland is currently marketing two vacant facilities in Sligo, together with a vacant advance building in Carrick-on-Shannon.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Following my consideration of the legal framework governing economic migration to Ireland from outside the European Economic Area, the Government agreed heads of a new Employment Permits Bill last March. The proposed legislation will put the instruments of economic migration on a modern statutory basis, will update penalties for non-compliance and will include an appeals process. The draft legislation is now with the parliamentary counsel for drafting.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is engaged in a more wide ranging review of policy, practice and procedures in relation to migration generally. Further legislative changes may follow that review.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	356	My Department is not a member of an insurance link scheme, whereby information on insurance claims made is exchanged.With regard to insurance matters, my role relates to the authorisation and prudential supervision of insurance companies with head office in the State and to the monitoring and evaluation of insurance costs and trends and the key contributory factors.Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and setting of premium levels are matters for judgment by individual insurance companies and EU law prevents us from intervening directly in the matter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Employment rights legislation has grown in volume, scope and complexity since the 1970s and that complexity extends also to the mechanisms for inspection, enforcement and the resolution of conflict. Without in any way eroding the protection of workers it is timely to look at the roles and the procedures of such bodies as the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission and the Employment Appeals Tribunal; the mechanisms to deal with the resolution of conflict in situations where, for example, workers feel that they are unable to exercise those rights; the appellate mechanisms which come into play after the rights commissioners or the tribunal have made their recommendations. In short, to look at a system of  rights and responsibilities which has grown up very often in response to EU initiatives and been grafted on to existing institutions, to ensure that the system is clear, coherent and user-friendly.

However, it could be some time before final decisions are taken.In an effort to safeguard its workforce, the company has redeployed about 150 staff to its two other processing facilities in Edenderry and Roscrea. The remaining 85 people continue to be employed in Rooskey.In addition, discussions have taken place between Enterprise Ireland and the company in relation to sourcing temporary facilities. However, the main thrust of activity is towards allowing the company to recommence activities within their facility in County Roscommon at the earliest opportunity.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The approved budget for the social economy programme in 2002 is €20.55 million. FÁS, which has day-to-day responsibility for the implementation of the social economy programme has advised that in relation to the uptake of this programme to date: 727 applications for business plan grant support have been received; 531 business plan grants of up to €5,080 have been approved; 227 social economy enterprises – with approximately 1,200 grant supported employees – have been approved for full start up grant support; and of these 227 social economy enterprises, a total of 158 have commenced operations currently employing 882 grant supported employees.There is currently a very strong pipeline of social economy enterprises. This will lead to a continuing increase in the level of grant supported employment over the remainder of the year as both existing enterprises take on new employees and a further number of enterprises commence operations. There will be a continuing emphasis on enterprise proposals, which have the greatest chance of providing sustainable employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged persons.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The number of redundancies notified to my Department in 2001 was 19,828. In the first five months of 2002 a total of 11,273 redundancies were notified.As regards anticipated job losses, one indicator of this is the number of collective redundancies notified to my Department under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977. These are the numbers of employees that companies have indicated that they propose to make redundant after the statutory minimum notification period of 30 days. A total of 5,104 collective redundancies were notified in the first five months of 2002. The equivalent figure for the same period in 2001 was 4,429.

Among the areas of potential discrimination are age or sex of an individual.The Agreed Programme for Government also contains a commitment to establish the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB. Towards that end, I expect shortly to present to the Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, the report of the interdepartmental implementation group which I can confirm I received recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by the Government.

The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc – formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	369	All persons coming to work in Ireland under the work permit or working visa/work authorisation facilities have the same rights in Irish law as Irish employees in similar circumstances. Furthermore, there is no nationality distinction in our social security framework and workers from overseas have the same entitlements as Irish employees in similar circumstances.While persons from non-EEA countries given permission to work in Ireland may be joined by family members after a specific period, this is not accompanied by an automatic permission to work as the persons coming here do so as dependants of a person authorised to work. This is generally in line with international practice. Any proposal to admit potentially large numbers of persons to the labour market by virtue of their family ties rather than on the basis of their skills would obviously require careful consideration. I would expect that issues such as this would fall to be considered in the context of the review of immigration policy and practice being carried out by my Department and by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I am not aware of any misleading information having been given by FÁS or our embassies abroad.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many businesses and individuals are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the attacks of 11 September in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market.However, the Government intends to tackle the high costs of insurance by way of the comprehensive set of measures which we have put forward in our Agreed Programme for Government.The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement urgently the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB.The implementation group, which was set up at the end of April 2002, is making good progress on preparation of an action plan to give effect to the 67 recommendations.

Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.Under the Equal Status Act, 2000 any individual who considers that he or she has experienced discrimination, within the meaning of the Act, may refer a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations for investigation or mediation.

It is not effective or appropriate in a modern market economy. Successive Governments have recognised that the promotion of a competitive environment, with greater price transparency coupled with consumer awareness and vigilance, are the best ways of ensuring value for money.Regulations are in place that require suppliers of goods and services, including retail outlets, to properly display prices. The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations, 2001 require retailers to indicate both the final selling price and the unit price for foodstuffs and non-foodstuffs. The objective of these regulations is to facilitate consumers in comparing prices between different brands and sizes of products in any given outlet, and between different outlets.Any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by suppliers of goods or services, including concerted price fixing, should be brought to the attention of the Competition Authority. It is responsible for monitoring and enforcing competition legislation.

The main focus of the task force is on attracting a replacement industry and the provision of assistance to the Tellabs employees to secure alternative employment. I understand that the vast majority of the former staff of Tellabs have now obtained alternative employment.The IDA has introduced a number of potential investors to the town and, in particular, to the vacant Tellabs facility. The IDA is continuing to market the facility for a replacement industry.I understand also that Enterprise Ireland is presently in discussions with a number of companies in respect of projects for the town of Drogheda.The work of the task force is continuing and I expect to receive its final report in the next few months.IDA Ireland is continuing to promote County Louth for new inward investment. In this regard, it has begun site development works at its new business and technology park in Drogheda where it has secured planning permission for a number of new buildings. The agency has also applied for planning permission for five new advance buildings at Finnabair Business Park in Dundalk. The IDA has advised that a company in Ardee is awaiting the outcome of a third party planning appeal, to begin construction of a new facility.

The deadline for implementation of the directive is 8 August 2002 and the regulations will come into operation on that date. Late payment of debt is harmful to companies and the intention of this legislation is to promote a culture of prompt payment.Ireland was one of the first countries in the EU to introduce legislation in this area in 1997. The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act which applies to the public sector only has been in operation for the past five years. The new regulations will apply to all commercial transactions in the public and private sectors. Under the provisions of this new legislation a payment will be regarded as being late if it is unpaid 30 days after the receipt of an invoice or goods unless otherwise specified in a contract. Penalty interest will be payable on debts paid after the relevant payment period.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The most recent publication of the Quarterly National Household Survey, (QNHS) for the first quarter of 2002, indicates that unemployment is currently running at 80,000 persons. This represents an increase of 7,400 in the quarter and 14,400 in the year. Those in short-term unemployment – less than 12 months – accounted for almost all of the annual increase where the numbers increased by over 13,000. In the first quarter of 2002, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. This compares with 4.0% in the fourth quarter of 2001, and 3.7% in the first quarter of 2001.Any increasing trend in the level of unemployment is disappointing but must be viewed in the context of a number of factors. These include the continuing increases in employment, albeit at a less dramatic rate than experienced in the recent past. There were 1,745,500 persons in employment in the first quarter 2002, over 35,600 higher than the first quarter of 2001. On average, employment grew by 2.1% in the year to the first quarter of 2002, compared with an annual increase of 3.6% in the first quarter of 2001.As one of the most open economies in Europe and the world, Ireland has been particularly exposed to the downturn in the world economy, most notably in the United States, over the past 18 months. This has manifested itself most notably in the high-tech sector. Despite this exposure Ireland has remained relatively unscathed and the most recent cross-country comparable figures show that our rate of unemployment for 2001, at 3.8%, was exactly half that of the European Union average.While there is still uncertainty about the short-term, economists are forecasting that a recovery in the global economy will be under way by later this year. EU forecasts predict that unemployment will rise to 4.5% this year and will remain at similar levels in the medium term. The ESRI forecast an annual average unemployment rate of  4.6% on an ILO basis for 2002 with a forecast of 4.4% for 2003.The fundamentals necessary for Ireland to take advantage of any prospective future recovery are in place. Enterprise Ireland and the IDA will continue to explore all avenues with regard to attracting foreign direct investment and stimulating indigenous job creation. FÁS, in tandem with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, will continue with its systematic engagement with those crossing thresholds of duration in unemployment, – six months for under 25s, and nine months for 25 to 55 year olds – to establish their suitability for job vacancies, training or other supports. This systematic approach has been very successful in facilitating the speedy reintegration of persons into the labour market, and in preventing the flow from short-term to long-term unemployment.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	378	A wide range of factors impact upon our competitiveness. At international level, the European Union produces a series of competitiveness comparisons such as the European competitiveness report, the enterprise policy scoreboard and the innovation scoreboard in which Irish performance has been top-ranking in terms of GDP growth (first), labour productivity (first), total factor productivity growth (first), lowest administrative burdens for small business, net birth rates for small business (first) etc.The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2002, which uses over 300 criteria to measure competitiveness, currently ranks Ireland in tenth place in the international competitiveness league. This is a drop of three places from last year's seventh placing.Our own National Competitiveness Council, in its most recent Competitiveness Report (2001), ranked Ireland in first and second place respectively under the headings of economic performance and internationalisation. But the Council also identified areas of concern, which it further elaborated upon in its Competitiveness Challenge Report, such as the rapid acceleration in wages growth and unit labour costs. It also ranked Ireland in 11th place out of 16 in relation to non-labour enterprise costs.The recently published data from the CSO, indicating a prevailing inflation level of some 4.7%, is also a shot across the bows which can impact upon our cost base. All of this means that the competitiveness agenda must again come centre stage. But the drivers of our competitiveness in the past, which derived from low wages and taxation as well as a plentiful supply of labour, will not be the same for the period ahead. We certainly have to moderate our costs, but this must be accompanied by a commitment to investment in those factors which enhance our productivity, including a shift to higher added-value knowledge-based activities, capitalising on the application of new technologies, investing in skills and research and development, promoting greater competition and addressing the infrastructural deficits. The measures the Government will be taking to meet these imperatives and secure the success we have attained in recent years are set out in the recently agreed Government programme, particularly under the heading of "Sustaining a Strong Economy".

The liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law.With regard to Irish policyholders of IICL, my Department has been in contact with the provisional liquidators of IICL and has sought information from them on a number of matters, including the amount of premiums paid to IICL, the overall value of claims made and details in relation to claims still outstanding against companies. Information has been received from them, most of it only in the very recent past and my Department is currently examining it in detail. It is not clear at this stage if the information is complete or whether it can be relied on to give the full picture. Indeed, it may be extremely difficult to obtain final comprehensive information in view of the timescale that can be involved in claims actually being made and in settlement amounts being arrived at.My Department has also been in contact with the UK Insurance Supervisory Authority – the Financial Services Commission – and with the UK Treasury Department in relation to our concerns regarding Irish policyholders with IICL. Irish policyholders with claims outstanding against IICL are creditors of that insurance company and should pursue their case with the provisional liquidators.

The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc (formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc).The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc. Approximately €23 million remains in the fund. The insurance compensation fund is under the control of the High Court. It may only be drawn down in the event of a liquidation of an Irish-authorised non-life insurance company. Should such an event occur, affected policyholders would of course be made aware of the arrangements.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The person in question applied to the military authorities in May 1998 under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, for access to copies of all documents in relation to his retirement from the Permanent Defence Force and in relation to his period of service in the Permanent Defence Force. The military authorities issued their decision on the application on 12 June 1998. They advised him that the records sought did not come within the scope of relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, except in so far as the request related to personal information, as provided for in the Act. In this regard, he was advised that he could have access to all personal information contained in his file for the period in question.In accordance with the provisions of the FOI Act, the individual, through his legal representatives, exercised his right to appeal the decision to the designated FOI internal appeals officer in the Defence Forces. The appeal was considered by the relevant officer, who upheld the initial decision. This decision was issued in writing to the applicant's legal representatives on 20 July 1998. Copies of the records which were deemed by the military decision makers to come within the scope of the FOI Act were forwarded to his then legal representatives in July 1998. When conveying his decision in relation to the internal review of the decision, the internal appeals officer advised the applicant of his statutory right of further appeal to the Information Commissioner, who is an independent officer with statutory powers to review decisions made by public bodies in relation to FOI applications. I understand that in July 1998, such an appeal was lodged in this case with the Office of the Information Commissioner. Such appeals are a matter for the Office of the Information Commissioner. However, I understand that the case was suspended in July, 1998 at the request of the applicant's then legal representatives and was subsequently discontinued by the Information Commissioner's Office in 1999, due to the subsequent non-pursuance of the matter by the individual concerned and his legal representatives at that time.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), military service allowance was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.More recently, the Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the MSA, and the consequences for public service pensioners generally in its final report which was published in January 2001. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised.I should say that the Commission, whose report is the first comprehensive examination of public service pension arrangements since the foundation of the State, was an independent body. It had invited submissions from interested parties through an advertisement in the national press in September 1996 and I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the Commission.

This expenditure is additional to the normal level of investment in equipment and infrastructure.Five of the six barracks, the closure of which was announced in 1998, have either been sold or are in the process of being sold. A number of other properties have also been identified as being surplus to military requirements. Total revenue from these sales is expected to be in the region of €100 million with the bulk of the revenue expected to be received later this year or in 2003.In anticipation of the receipt of revenue from property sales, substantial additional money has been provided in the Defence Estimate over the past few years. This has resulted in an unprecedented level of investment in equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces.

However, arising from the acquisition of certain estates, the former Irish Land Commission retained a portion of the purchase money for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of embankments and sluices on those estates. These retained funds were entrusted to the Public  Trustee, who is now an officer of my Department. The Public Trustee has responsibility for the investment of these funds and the income earned may be applied for the specific purposes described in the trust deed for each estate. In the context of an ongoing or perpetual trust, it is established practice that the capital sum should not be used for general repairs except in exceptional circumstances.In relation to the site in question, a small trust fund was set up for the upkeep of embankments and other works on the E. H. Davies Estate. Local trustees were appointed and they may apply to the Public Trustee to release funds to cover maintenance work. Over the years funds have been released, as appropriate. This fund covers a large area of embankments and my Department is attempting to get local agreement as to the proportion of the fund that should be used in any particular location.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The animal health requirements for dairy cows are set out in Directive 92/46/EEC and in the Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1996 and the certificate reflects this. Individual veterinarians must, of course, use their own professional judgment when certifying individual herds. Inspection and certification of dairy herds has already been carried out on a countrywide basis.As regards the national beef assurance scheme, the position is that the traceability elements have been fully operational since January 2000. It was envisaged that other elements of this scheme would be undertaken this year in tandem with the annual round of testing. In this regard, detailed discussions took place with Veterinary Ireland and its predecessor organisation over a long period concerning the arrangements for the inspection of farms. A Protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed with both Veterinary Ireland and the representative farming organisations late last year. There was also agreement that the inspections should be carried out by the testing veterinary surgeon at the time of the annual herd test. However while arrangements were put in place to have inspections under the scheme commenced in March in tandem with the 2002 annual round of testing, only a small number of inspections have taken place to date because of resistance to implementation of the scheme mainly by veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system the costs involved.In this context, the legislation passed by the Oireachtas establishing the scheme clearly provides that the cost of securing a certificate of approval is the responsibility of the applicant. In addition, the Exchequer has already invested some €43 million in developing the cattle identification and tracing system that underpins the scheme, and costs continue to be incurred under this heading.The national beef assurance scheme was designed to provide additional assurances to consumers and customers of Irish beef by demonstrating strict implementation of high standards across the production chain. The scheme is an important element in the drive to maintain marketplace in a sector recovering from serious difficulty. I am disappointed with the attitude of Veterinary Ireland and I would strongly urge them again to lend their full support to the scheme.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	397	It is a requirement of the Council regulations governing both the 1994 early retirement scheme and the scheme introduced in 2000 that the early retirement pension is paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension to which the participant in the scheme is, or becomes, entitled. Consequently the amount of any national retirement pension must be deducted from the early retirement pension. This requirement was set out in both schemes. The attention of applicants was further drawn to it in the guidelines which my Department published to accompany the 1994 scheme, and it is also highlighted in the introduction to the new scheme document. As the matter is the subject of a specific provision in the relevant EU Council Regulations, it is not one in which my Department has discretion.The rate of pension payable under the 1994 early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council Regulation under which the scheme was introduced. As regards the current scheme which commenced in November 2000, and which forms part of the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-2006, my Department's proposals to the EU Commission included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The Commission rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set instead. My Department then proposed a rate that was the average of the scale initially proposed. This was acceptable to the Commission and is the rate provided for in the new scheme.

This category, which ranked fourth in priority after category A for young farmers under 35 years of age, category B – farmers with holdings on off-shore islands and category C – organic farmers, was reserved for farmers who were regular applicants for the suckler cow premium scheme but who required additional quota to ensure the viability of their holdings.The amount of quota available for distribution was 2,598 premium rights and all of this was distributed to eligible farmers under categories A, B and C. Because of the scarcity of quota, not all eligible applicants under category C received an allocation. There was, therefore, no quota available for distribution to any eligible applicants under category D.The person named may apply for an allocation of quota from the 2003 national reserve and I have arranged to have an application form sent to him when the forms become available in late July.

Accordingly, he gave a written undertaking to complete the measures specified in his REPS plan over a five-year period, and to integrate and adapt that plan for the new REP scheme when it came into operation. The new REP scheme came into operation on 27 Nov ember 2000 but the person concerned never adapted and integrated his plan as he had undertaken to do.When he applied to join REPS, the person named gave a written undertaking to repay any moneys received under the scheme if he failed to carry out his undertaking as regards transition arrangements. In light of the above, my Department must seek to recoup all the payments that the person named received under the rural environment protection scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The person named applied for premium for 40 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of the application one animal tag number BLA262584 was deleted without penalty as it had been duplicated. At inspection, one animal, tag number LEA660998 was absent as it had died prior to the application date. This resulted in this animal being rejected from the claim with a consequential reduction penalty to be applied on the 38 remaining animals. Processing of the payment has been delayed as the CMMS database was not updated with regard to the death of the animal. The person named submitted the relevant documentation on 4 June 2002 and this matter has now been finalised. Correspondence is issuing from my Department advising the herdowner that his application is now being further processed for payment on the above basis.

The person named also received a national envelope top-up payment in respect of one heifer under that herd number.The person named had nine other animals slaughtered during the period July to September 2001 under a separate herd number that was cancelled in March 2001. The person named was requested to have the herd number details at the slaughter plant amended to reflect the correct herd number. To date this has not been done and it is therefore necessary for the Department to transfer the details to the new herd number. Slaughter premium payment will issue on eight of these nine animals as soon as possible.There is an outstanding query on one animal, the tag number of which has been notified to the person named, in relation to the slaughter status of the animal on the CMMS, cattle movement monitoring system. Payment will issue on this animal as soon as the slaughter of this animal has been confirmed.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Recent data indicates that aggregate farm income has recovered following a number of difficult years in the late 1990s. Aggregate farm income rose by 5.8% in 2001 with an increase of 7.5% being recorded in 2000. Based on the Central Statistics Office national quarterly household survey, my Department estimates that the average income per person employed in agriculture increased by 16% in 2001.Farm incomes are of central concern to me as Minister. My Department operates a range of policies including market supports under the Common Agricultural Policy and EU direct payments formed 56% of aggregate income in the year 2001 totalling €1.4b. The Agri-Food 2010 plan of action sets out the Government's vision for the future of the sector. The plan of action envisages a dynamic agri-food sector in 2010 offering farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus maintaining the maximum number of people on the land.I am aware that low income remains a difficulty for some farm families. The revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, launched by the Government in February 2002, includes a specific focus on addressing rural poverty and disadvantage. Its objective is to tackle social exclusion in rural areas in a comprehensive and sustained manner by ensuring the provision of an adequate income, through employment and income support, access to adequate services and infrastructure on a timely basis, co-ordination of responses and empowerment of local people and communities.I am satisfied that the necessary policy framework, underpinned by both national and EU funding, is in place, together with appropriate monitoring and review arrangements, to ensure viability of the maximum number of farm households. I do not therefore consider that the establishment of a commission on farm income is required.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	422	The current situation is that bed and breakfast establishments charge VAT at the reduced rate of 12.5%. There is provision within the EU Sixth VAT Directive to apply a reduced rate of VAT which could be as low as 5% for "accommodation provided by hotels and similar establishments including provision of holiday accommodation and the letting of camping sites and caravan parks". If there was a change in the current VAT treatment of bed and breakfast accommodation, this would have to be extended to all tourist rented accommodation, such as hotels, since a different rate of VAT for bed and breakfast as opposed to other forms of tourist accommodation would create a tax-based comparative advantage for one part of the tourism rented sector.I believe that the introduction of a lower rate of VAT for bed and breakfast accommodation would also lead to pressure for the rate to apply to all activities which could benefit from such a second reduced rate, such as housing, some foods, certain pharmaceuticals and newspapers. If all activities which could be taxed at a reduced rate were taxed at 5%, this would mean a loss of revenue for the Government of at least €500 million. In view of the potential Exchequer costs of introducing any new reduced rate, I cannot agree to make any change to the rate of VAT on bed and breakfast accommodation. As the Deputy will appreciate, every year I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new rates or the extension of existing ones. However, tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and funding available for other projects.

This means they do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. There are no provisions in the EU Sixth VAT Directive which would allow for any refund of VAT to exempt bodies. I would point out, however, that charities already enjoy relief from most taxes. Furthermore, in the Finance Act, 2001, I provided for a new scheme of tax relief for donations to charities. This is a generous scheme which has, I understand, already been of significant benefit to them.

One of the conditions governing the issue of a C2 is that a person to whom the certificate is issued must be fully tax compliant. There is specific provision for the withdrawal of a C2 where a person fails to pay all of his or her taxes due or has failed to deliver all the necessary returns.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax affairs of the person to whom the question relates are not up to date. His inspector of taxes wrote to him some time ago advising that unless his tax affairs were regularised he risked the withdrawal of his C2.

There is a detailed planning and consultation process set out in the Acts and it can take several years for a scheme to move from initiation to completion. The current programme does not include any schemes in the areas referred to by the Deputy. Apart from schemes carried out under the Acts, the Office of Public Works does, in some cases, provide technical advice, assistance and funding to local authorities who wish to carry out flood relief works under their own authority.The flooding referred to by the Deputy was due to abnormal and exceptionally high tides. The tide levels in Dublin were higher than the floods of 1924, when the previous highest tide in Dublin Port was recorded. Rainfall was not a significant influencing factor. The tidal surge was caused by a combination of wind and low atmospheric pressure and it has been calculated that, statistically, the event had a return period of 750 years. I understand that city council staff prepared an interim assessment report which was presented to Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Office of Public Works in February 2002. This report outlined the impact which resulted in the flooding of 1000 houses.

Arrangements were recently instituted under  which persons employed as secretarial assistants, administrative assistants, or administrators who cease to be so employed as a result of post-electoral changes, or persons choosing to leave such employment, would be offered a payment of a lump-sum based on length of service. Such a payment would be conditional on the person ceasing to be paid not later than 28 June 2002 and subject to certain other conditions. The scheme will not continue beyond the date specified in the case of staff working for Deputies and political parties or, in the case of their counterparts employed by or on behalf of Senators, two weeks after the Seanad elections. Eligibility for payments under the Redundancy Payment Acts, 1967 to 2001, is determined by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have no function in the matter.

According to the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer did not pay income tax in the 1998/99 or 1999/00 tax years. As a result of a review of the taxpayer's liability for the 2000/01 tax year, a repayment of £395.71, €502.45, was made to the taxpayer on 5 October 2001. A review of the taxpayer's liability for the 2001 short tax year resulted in repayments of £103.32, €131.19, on 15 November 2001 and €129.78, £102.21, on 22 January 2002. There are no further refunds due to the taxpayer at present.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	430	The imposition of VAT is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. Broadly speaking, the zero rate covers children's clothing of sizes up to and including 32" chest or 26" waist; other sizes are liable for VAT at the standard rate of 21%. The standard rate of VAT applies to all adult clothing including protective clothing for motorcyclists.Due to the requirement of EU VAT law, which prohibits the introduction of any new zero rates, it is not possible to extend existing zero rates to adult clothing. Therefore, it would not be possible to exempt protective clothing for motorcyclists from VAT.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayers are jointly assessed for income tax purposes. The inspector of taxes has reviewed their income tax liability for the 1998/99 tax year. The review established that the taxpayers' total income for the year, which consisted of their employment income and the second-named taxpayer's unemployment benefit, a taxable payment, and redundancy payment, was liable to tax at the standard rate of 24%. As the taxpayer's redundancy payment was taxed at the higher rate of 46%, a refund of €857.85 is due. A cheque for this amount will be issued shortly.Top slicing relief ensures that a lump sum payment is not taxed at a rate higher than the average rate of tax paid by the taxpayer in the previous five years. As the second-named taxpayer's redundancy payment was liable only at the standard rate of tax, which rate was lower than the average rate of tax in the previous five years, top-slicing relief does not arise in this case.

The Inspector has been in touch with the taxpayer's employer seeking details of his income and tax deducted for the period in question. This information has now been received.

No 353 of 1994), copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows:(a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;(b) persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs;(c) persons without both hands or without both arms;(d) persons without one or both legs;(e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;(f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is currently in the region of 7,500. The cost of the reliefs, excluding the annual road tax costs, in 2001 was approximately €30.5 million, compared to €5.1 million in 1994. The cost of the scheme, again excluding the annual road tax costs, is estimated to be in the region of €38 million in 2002. Beneficiaries, once qualified, are eligible for life. A review of the scheme by an interdepartmental review group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is ongoing.

The first €125 of expenses incurred in respect of a claim in respect of an individual and the first €250 of expenses incurred in respect of a claim relating to two or more individuals are excluded from the scope of the relief. The relief is available at the claimant's marginal rate of tax. An individual may apply for the relief by submitting a completed Med 1 form to the inspector of taxes after 31 December in the year in which the expenditure occurred.Claims may be made by an individual in respect of his/her own expenses, expenses met for a spouse, dependant and certain other relatives or a child who is not a relative, but is in the custody of and is maintained by the individual, or an individual whether they are a relative or not who is aged 65 or over or who is permanently incapacitated.Expenditure on the following qualifies for relief:services of a doctor/consultant; drugs or medicines prescribed by a doctor on prescription; maintenance or treatment in a hospital or an approved nursing home; routine maternity care; educational psychological assessment for a qualifying child; speech and language therapy carried out by a speech and language therapist for a qualifying child; transport by ambulance; orthoptic or similar treatment prescribed by a doctor; physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner; diagnostic procedures prescribed by a practitioner; expenses incurred on any medical, surgical or nursing appliance on the advice of a practitioner; and in the case of kidney patients, expenses up to a maximum amount for individuals on the use of hospital dialysis, home dialysis or CAPD.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	436	As the Deputy will be aware, in the Finance Act, 2001, the various tax reliefs for third level education were merged into a single relief and the relief was considerably widened. Generally speaking, the new relief now covers fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. It also applies to fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. Undergraduate courses, which may be full or part-time, must be of at least two academic years duration while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years duration. Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses, of less than two years duration, in the areas of information technology and EU languages.Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian all qualify for relief, which is available at the standard rate of tax. No relief is available for any part of fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise.The maximum relief that can be claimed is set by the Minister for Education and Science. It is currently €3,175 per year in respect of third level fees. In the case of fees for training courses in EU languages and information technology, the maximum relief is set at €1,270 per annum and no relief is due where the fees for the course are less than €315. Given the recent improvements made to the scheme, I have no plans at this stage to make any further changes.

The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. There is no provision in EU VAT law for any refund of VAT to exempt bodies such as those represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.
Questions Nos. 233 to 235, inclusive, answered with Question No. 229.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The Government has been actively responding to the unfolding food crisis in southern Africa which has already had a severe impact on the vulnerable people of Malawi. It continues to threaten millions of others across Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe and is set to worsen in the weeks ahead. An initial allocation of €1.2 million has already been made to help cover immediate needs in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Government is working closely with its Irish NGO and other implementing partners in building on this initial response. We are also monitoring the situation closely through our missions in Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and South Africa. The Government's overall response is, therefore, set to deepen considerably during the critical weeks ahead.This latest food crisis is the outcome of unusually dry climatic conditions which have resulted in crop failure and low crop yields over consecutive growing seasons. It is also being attributed to bad governance and the mismanagement of grain reserves. We are now in a situation where regional grain stocks in southern Africa are exceptionally low, having already been drawn upon to meet last year's shortages. The situation is worsened by the heavy impact which the HIV-AIDS pandemic and recent conflict are already having in the region. A joint assessment mission by the World Food Programme and the Food and Agricultural Organisation estimates that 7.7 million people will require food aid during June to August while 12.8 million will need assistance by March of next year, almost half of them in Zimbabwe. The immediate corn deficit for southern Africa is expected to be in excess of two million tonnes. Ireland is paying particular attention to the situation in Zimbabwe which is expected to account for 56% of the total emergency food aid requirement. That country is particularly ill-equipped to cope with the food emergency due to its protracted political and economic crises. For its part, the European Commission has granted €6.5 million in food aid to Zimbabwe along with an additional 95,000 tonnes of food aid worth €29 million to Malawi.

It is also my intention to bring greater transparency to the operation of the school building programme and I intend to publish the programme annually.

The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes – infants through second class – and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth classes.Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements under that scheme.Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school in question is benefiting from the services of a shared disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of €38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.

Successful completion of the three-year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency.In 2001 the Government approved the implementation of a new four-year undergraduate pre-registration nursing degree programme commencing in the academic year 2002-03. Accordingly, with effect from the 2002-03 academic year, students pursuing the bachelor of science degree in nursing will be eligible to benefit under the free fees initiative, whereby the State meets the tuition fees of students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, subject to the terms and conditions of that initiative.With effect from the 2002-03 academic year, the bachelor of science degree in nursing will also be an approved course for the purposes of the higher education maintenance grants scheme and the vocational education scholarship scheme. Under the terms of the grants schemes, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.

There is no provision within the terms of the existing scheme to allow for the refund of the registration charge where a student does not qualify for a maintenance grant and, accordingly, the student referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for grant assistance towards the cost of his registration fee.The schemes of student support are reviewed by my Department annually and revised as necessary. The question of amending the terms of the TLT scheme to allow, subject to a prescribed upper income limit, for the payment of the registration fee in cases where a maintenance grant is not payable is being considered in the context of the review of the 2002 scheme.

However, these qualifications are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in mainstream primary schools. Therefore, a person who holds a bachelor of arts and higher diploma would not be qualified to teach in a permanent capacity in mainstream primary schools.However, my Department will grant restricted recognition to qualified second level teachers to teach in a permanent capacity in special schools, where a proportion of the pupils attending the school are of post-primary age – 12 years or older – and where second level programmes are being provided by the school. This recognition applies to all suitably qualified second level teachers and not just to holders of a bachelor of arts and higher diploma.Further details in relation to the recognition of teaching qualifications for the purpose of teaching in national schools are contained in departmental circular 25/00. I have asked my officials to send a copy to the Deputy.

My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual "at risk" pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.The schools targeted under Giving Children an Even Break were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.

Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Acts. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.My Department will carry out an investigation where it is claimed that a board is operating its enrolment policy in a manner which discriminates against a particular child. On the basis of the details supplied by the Deputy this does not appear to be the case in this instance.Generally, eligibility for school transport is determined by reference to distance from the nearest suitable school. In order to be eligible for free transport, children must live at least two miles from and be attending their nearest school. If the Deputy provides the name of the school to which the pupil is seeking transport, my Department will have the case investigated as a matter of urgency.

My Department reimburses the school authority with the costs of approved posts.Last April an official advised the school of the correct payment procedures in the case to which the Deputy refers and it was a matter for the school authority to arrange for the person in question to be paid in accordance with agreed rates. An official has again contacted the school and has been given to understand that the matter is now in hand.

This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 74 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year.As the agreed appointment figure for the third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, I regret that the appointment of the third mainstream class teacher cannot be sanctioned for the 2002-03 school year.The above staffing agreement can only be deviated from in instances where schools have rapid growth in enrolment numbers. Should Brannockstown national school achieve an enrolment of 99 or more pupils by September 2002, its board of management may apply to the primary payments section of my Department for a developing school post.

I acknowledge, however, that there was an historic deficit in funding such education resources and further progress is needed in the special education system before we can be satisfied that every child has access to the kind of education resources, which he or she needs and to which he or she is entitled. I am committed to making that progress. I also acknowledge that because of resourcing and organisational issues there are parents who feel it necessary in the interests of their child to seek redress in the courts. That is their right. It is entirely misleading, however, for the Deputy to imply that my Department takes cases "against" such families. My Department responds to cases brought against the State, as it is obliged to do, and most are settled on agreed terms without a court hearing.

However, the nature and level of the special educational response provided is largely based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. The national educational psychological service, which was established in 1999,  employs qualified educational psychologists to provide the assessment service.Students who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes/units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. Children attending on a fully integrated basis are supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. At present, there are more than 1,700 resource teachers and 3,300 special needs assistants in place in primary schools supporting children with special educational needs on an integrated basis.Children with more severe levels of disability may require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school. Each such facility is dedicated to a particular disability group and each operates at a specially reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending such facilities attract special rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the school bus escort service.Under a Government decision of October 1998, all children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. All schools have been advised of the procedures through which they may gain access to the above range of services.

To date, some 90 special classes dedicated to children with autism have been established within the primary sector. Each such class operates at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of at least two special needs assistants. Further such classes are being established on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs. In addition, my Department is currently funding five projects, which are delivering an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism.Children who have special needs, including children with autism attending mainstream schools, are generally catered for with the support of a resource teacher and special needs assistant services. The level of support provided in any particular case is determined by the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure if appropriate.The report from the task force on autism has presented a comprehensive range of proposals for the future development of services for children with autism. This report, which is currently being considered in my Department, will make an important contribution to the further development of services in this area.

Additional expenditure on free fees has to be considered in the light of other demands in the education system in increasing lifelong learning opportunities, tackling educational disadvantage at all levels, addressing capital and equipment needs and improving support services across the system. To abolish fees for all part-time students would be extremely costly and there are no plans at present to do so.However, the importance and impact of funding arrangements is recognised in the light of the challenges facing education institutions in regard to issues such as equity, flexibility, competitiveness, workplace learning and demographic change. The issue of part-time fees is one of the areas being examined at present by the task force on lifelong learning which was established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in collaboration with education, training, community and voluntary and social partner interests. The issue will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations in the task force report, which is due shortly, and the budgetary situation.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogenous group either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for the individual child, in consultation with their parents, on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.In this context, and in relation to the choice of communication system, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English. If the option is for spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach, signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.If the option is for Irish signed language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of Irish sign language. There is a growing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account.In this regard, I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a number of classes in which sign language is the medium of communication and teaching. Special needs assistants, who are proficient in sign language, have also been provided for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.

Third level and PLC students may also avail of means-tested maintenance grants. In addition, adults over 21 who are unemployed at least six months, or dependent spouses, lone parents and people with disabilities who satisfy these criteria and are pursuing recognised full time courses in further or higher education may either receive a training allowance under the vocational training opportunities scheme or a payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the back to education allowance scheme.Tax relief at standard rates is available up to a fee limit of €3,175 for fees paid in respect of nationally certified post graduate courses, and nationally certified full-time or part-time third level courses of at least two years duration. Tax relief is also available on fees, ranging from €315 to €1,270, paid in respect of FÁS IT and foreign language courses.Under the recently announced back to education initiative, under which part time options are being introduced in the further education sector, tuition will be free for medical card holders, means-tested welfare recipients and those with unemployment payments or family income supplement, and their dependants. A reduced fee will apply to other unwaged categories with less than upper secondary education, and fees will be charged for the remainder. The impact of this on the participation of specific groups will be monitored.

The physical science initiative, which was established to support the introduction of the new syllabi, has been in place for three years. As part of this initiative, additional resources have been provided to schools and a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers has been implemented and is being extended for a further year.A revised syllabus for junior cycle mathematics was introduced in 2000 and will be examined for the first time in 2003. The junior certificate mathematics support service is being augmented for the next school year. Recently my Department has requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to review the leaving certificate mathematics syllabi in the light of concerns expressed in the published report of the chief examiner for leaving certificate mathematics ordinary level examination for 2001.The task force on physical sciences presented its report to my predecessor earlier this year. The report has now been made available for consultation, with a deadline of 1 September 2002 for comments on its findings and recommendations. An action and implementation strategy will be developed and put in place by my Department following the end of the consultation period.

The action group considered that the target group of "those most in need" could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education – that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she-he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she-he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she-he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she-he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.

This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners. The enrolment of this school on 30 September, 2001 was 11 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal teacher for the 2002-03 school year. As the agreed retention figure for the first mainstream class teacher is 12 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction a continuation of this post at Leaffoney national school for the 2002-03 school year. Should this school achieve a valid enrolment of 12 or more pupils by the 30 September 2002 the post of first mainstream class teacher will be restored to the school for the 2003-04 school year.

These places are being provided in response to the recommendations set out in the report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, which was launched in July 2001. The recent announcement follows on the work of an inter-agency group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, which was established to ensure the provision of the additional places and which considered proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the Bacon report.The distribution of the additional places is as follows:University College Cork, National University of Ireland – Cork25 places – Bachelor of Science in speech and language therapy25 places – Bachelor of Science in occupational therapyNational University of Ireland, Galway25 places – Bachelor of Science in speech and language therapy25 places – Bachelor of Science in occupational therapyUniversity of Limerick25 places – Master of Science in speech and language therapy25 places – Master of Science in occupational therapy25 places – Bachelor of Science in physiotherapyIt is expected that the first intake to these courses will commence in the 2002-03 academic year.

The allocation to an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more are entitled to a full post and those with an enrolment below 600 are entitled to the equivalent of one half of a post for remedial education.My Department also makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance in second level schools. The allocation ranges from 0.36 of a post – eight hours per week – in schools in the free education scheme with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.With regard to the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment warrants an allocation of 0.5 of a post in respect of remedial education and 0.5 of a post in respect of guidance and provision for this has been made in the approved teacher allocation for the school for the 2002-03 school year.The question of allocating additional resources to second level schools in respect of remedial education and guidance will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the recommendations of the expert group on the allocation of teachers to second level schools.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	573	Third level education in the south-east region is provided by the Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology and by the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute. There are no proposals at present in developing a university of the south-east. The question of a university for the south-east has been raised previously in the context of the development of Waterford Institute of Technology. There are no plans to change the status of Waterford Institute of Technology.In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional Technical College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee's report recommended an increase in student places from 3,500 to 5,000 in the Regional Technical College, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. The report also recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other Regional Technical Colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.The Government accepted these recommendations and the provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses, in what is now Waterford Institute of Technology has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. In this regard, figures supplied to my Department by Waterford Institute of Technology indicate that over 40% of the 5,443 students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses, in the 2000-01 academic year, were pursuing degree courses. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college to institute of technology, provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach WIT is among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make their own educational awards under the terms of the Qualification (Education and Training) Act, 1999.

My officials will liaise with the school authorities when this examination has been completed.The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia of primary school age are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the support, where necessary, of the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. There are currently 1,485 learning support teachers and in excess of 1,700 full-time equivalent resource teachers in place in the primary system.For some children, the severity of the condition can be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. At present, there are four special schools and 21 special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia. Funding is also provided to meet any special equipment needs of the children in question.My predecessor recently announced a number of important new measures to enhance the education of children with dyslexia following recommendations of the task force on dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first ever on-line training for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers; and the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio in special classes for dyslexia from 11: 1 to 9:1The report of the task force on dyslexia is comprehensive and far reaching. I am committed to making further significant progress on the recommendations of the task force over as short a period of time as possible.

It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.

The examination paper was designed to test candidates' knowledge across the range of the syllabus. The current biology syllabus is presented in ten sections and no section of the syllabus was omitted from the examination paper. There is a significant element of choice within the examination paper whereby candidates are required to answer four questions from eight questions provided in part 2 of the paper. Candidates are required to answer six from seven short questions in part 1 of the paper. If there is evidence that the diagram in question 6 was blurred on some examination papers, the marking conference will take that into consideration. The questions relating to the other two diagrams for question 5 and question 14 are very clear and precise.There was no question in relation to the dissection of frogs. Candidates were asked to describe an experiment that involved frog tadpoles. This experiment is specified in the syllabus. The Department has a licence – No. C9/2002 – from Dúchas to collect frogspawn and this licence permits teachers of science subjects to collect frogspawn for educational purposes. It has been established practice for many years in biology examination papers to require candidates to draw diagrams of a variety of objects including tissues and organs. The published marking schemes and published chief examiners' reports have indicated that marks are awarded for diagrams and teachers are aware of this practice.My Department does not intend to set an alternative examination paper. All correspondence from individuals and organisations should be forwarded to the examinations branch. They then will be brought to the attention of the chief examiner and the examining team in the context of developing a marking scheme that will take into account any valid issues raised. The marking scheme for this paper will be published along with those in all other subjects in advance of the viewing of scripts in late August. In that way, examination candidates who view their scripts will have the opportunity to see in detail precisely how marks were allocated.

A further phase of investment in broadband will involve each of the Twenty-Six Counties.Phase one of the broadband programme will see 19 towns, many in the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region targeted immediately. Metropolitan area fibre optic networks will be built in these towns to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide "always on" low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda. The relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. The first phase is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities which will receive 90% funding from the Exchequer. The launch of the second phase of the broadband programme will be contingent on the success of the first phase.

In October 2000, my Department requested the seven regional fisheries boards to encourage the development of measures at catchment level to incentivise the reduction of the commercial salmon fishing effort based on consensus and local contribution and to forward such proposals to my Department and the National Salmon Commission. The person referred to by the Deputy, who I understand is a member of the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, was advocating a set aside of commercial salmon fishing engines in the Boyne estuary, which is situated in the fisheries region of the board. However, to date my Department has received no substantive proposal for a set-aside in the Boyne estuary from the eastern board or any other group.

The consultants concluded, inter alia, that until the challenges facing the forest sector had been resolved, a change in the ownership structure of Coillte should not be considered. Various options outlined, including outright or partial sale and IPO, were regarded by the consultants as realistic options for consideration in the longer term. The consultants recommended no change in the ownership of Coillte for the forseeable future – probably the subsequent five years or so. My predecessor accepted the recommendations of the consultants and I see no reason to review the position at this juncture.As to joint ventures, the Deputy may wish to note that, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, my predecessor gave approval last month to Coillte to enter into a joint venture with an Austrian company, GriffnerHaus GmbH, in relation to the building of modular timber houses. No proposals in respect of further joint ventures have been submitted by Coillte.

The new vessel initiative involved a total investment of €56 million, including €15.7 million in grant aid. This is the largest single investment in the fishing sector since the foundation of the State.Seventy four applications were initially received under the new vessel scheme of which eight were subsequently withdrawn. All remaining 66 applications were rigorously assessed by BIM in accordance with published selection criteria. Thirty eight projects were approved by BIM for grant aid. BIM's approval of the 38 projects was in line with the available funding for new vessels as published in the financial programme for the measure. BIM did not, on this basis, compile a "reserve list" of projects. Accordingly, I do not have the scope to expand the new vessel scheme. However, other elements of the current programme provide our fishermen with significant opportunities to apply for support for investment projects. These elements include support for the modernisation of existing vessels and for the purchase and installation of vital safety equipment. In addition, special assistance is available for young fishermen and women acquiring their first vessel.

Funding of €247,969.30 was provided over the past two years for safety works, minor improvements and surfacing. A portion of the funding provided in 2001 was in respect of a cost benefit analysis of the local authority's development proposals for the harbour. This cost benefit analysis is now nearing completion and I expect the county council to submit the findings to my Department for consideration in the near future. Funding allocation will be informed by the findings of the cost benefit analysis. However, under the national development plan, funding for major fishery harbour development work is substantially oversubscribed at this point. Future capital development of Clogherhead will be assessed in the light of the cost benefit analysis and the overall funding envelope available.

Section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 – No. 26 of 1995 –  provides that a marriage shall not be valid unless both parties to a marriage have given three months written notification of their intention to marry to the appropriate registrar of marriages or an exemption to this requirement had been granted by the courts as provided by section 33 of the Act. Where the requirements set out in section 32 have not been fulfilled, a marriage is not valid in civil law and may not be registered. Unfortunately, the marriage referred to by the Deputy may not be registered because the three months notification required by section 32 of the Act of 1995 was not received by a registrar of marriages and a court exemption to the requirement to give three months written notification was not obtained.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	651	In recognition of the importance of leisure activities and their role in promoting and sustaining personal and community development, the new programme for Government builds on commitments given in the national children's strategy. The strategy, which is a significant Government ten year plan to improve the quality of all children's lives, includes a commitment to the development of play and recreation policies.Approximately 2,500 children and 300 adults participated in a consultation process feeding into the preparation of the national children's strategy. The main issue raised by children in the consultation process was the lack of play and recreation facilities for children and young people. The deficit in the provision of public playgrounds was often highlighted. At the launch of the strategy, the Taoiseach announced that a national play and recreation policy would be developed to address this issue. The development and implementation of the new policy is one of the priority areas for attention by the National Children's Office.The new policy will provide a framework for future development and will look at a range of issues, including: guiding principles; a partnership approach between the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors; developing a play infrastructure; other issues including safety, public liability insurance and litigation matters; and funding arrangements. It is proposed to address the leisure needs of children up to 12 years of age in a national play policy and to deal with the wider range of recreational opportunities for teenagers in a national recreation policy.There are a number of inputs to the development of these policies. These include advice from the National Children's Advisory Council, the establishment of a working group comprising key statutory and non-statutory agencies, a survey of public playground provision and the establishment of pilot projects to identify the issues likely to be encountered in providing a public play facilities of a high standard. Research into the influences on young people's recreational choices will also be undertaken. It is hoped to circulate a draft play policy for consultation in the autumn. The policy, including the financial implications and the identification of responsibility for implementation, will be submitted to Government for approval.

Under the Health Act, 1970, entitlement to health services is primarily based on residence and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioners services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.Persons in category 2 – non-medical card holders – are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services. Dental and routine ophthalmic and aural services are excluded from out-patient services available. However, such treatment is provided to children who have been referred from a child health clinic or a school health examination.

My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised and reply direct to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I propose to take Questions Nos. 457, 528 and 553 together.My Department has received legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on this matter, the implications of which are currently under examination by the Department. I would point out that the drugs payment scheme, introduced on 1 July 1999, essentially amalgamated the existing drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes, and provided that families would only have to meet the first €53.33 per month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The threshold for the DCSS scheme was €40.63 per month per individual, and €114.28 per quarter for each eligible person and dependants for the DRS. Under the DRS the person had to pay for the drugs at the pharmacy, and claim a refund from the health board at the end of the quarter.The new drugs payments scheme was designed to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes, to be more user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The scheme was also designed to iron out anomalies whereby, for example, a person or family who might spend €101.58 in one month on medicines and have no expenditure for the remainder of the quarter would not be entitled to any refund. Accordingly, under this new scheme families are able to budget for the cost of prescribed medicines.Regardless of the cost of their prescribed medicines, families are liable only for a maximum of €53.33 in any month. A further advantage is that applicants are not required to pay and claim a refund as in the previous schemes. In addition there are no qualifying criteria for the DPS unlike the previous DCSS where a person had to have a certificate from a doctor and be approved by a health board as having a long-term medical condition requiring regular and continuous prescribed drugs in excess of €40.63 per month.The financial benefits of the new DPS are reflected in the significantly increased spending level relative to the earlier schemes it replaced. The total cost of the DPS and the DCSS in 1998, the last full year of operation, was £74.69 million. In contrast the new DPS cost £110 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to £140 million in 2001. The aggregate benefits of the new scheme are clearly significantly greater than the previous schemes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	656	Responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapy services to children and adults with an intellectual disability in the north east is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, in respect of the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In addition to this ringfenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.However many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.

In this regard, I would like to inform the Deputy that my Department is not seeking to restrict availability of these medicinal products, other than in cases where there may be overriding public health considerations. On the contrary, in order to seek to ensure the continued availability of such products that are of appropriate quality and safety, my Department is currently examining proposals from the Irish Medicines Board for the control of these products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional medicinal products which they buy are: produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the recommended conditions of use; can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use, and are appropriately labelled.In order to gain the most from these types of medicinal products, it is essential that they be controlled by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicinal products, they are of an appropriate quality and safe for the consumer to use. The interests of public health can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for the assessment of these products and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to assure their continued safety in use.

All health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s).

The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional €1.191 million last year for orthodontic services of which €1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to inter alia recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of whom will be located in Kerry.The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that the Local Appointments Commission has recommended a candidate for one of the consultant orthodontist posts, to be based in the north of Cork city. This candidate is expected to take up duty with the board in September 2002. The board is presently examining the possibility of re-advertising the other consultant post for the Tralee unit in order to expedite an appointment. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. My Department has provided additional funding of €0.932 million for orthodontic services in 2002 of which €0.541 million was for a specialist training programme in orthodontics. Six dentists from the health boards – four of which are from the Eastern Regional Health Authority – commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.

There are no plans to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with Crohn's disease.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

My Department asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is responsible for the delivery of health services in counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, for its comments on this matter. The difficulties experienced by clients in waiting for assessment, therapy and the provision of appropriate aids by the authority are acknowledged. These difficulties arise from problems encountered in recruiting specialist staff such as occupational therapists. I have asked the authority to outline directly to the Deputy the steps being taken to overcome these problems.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	667	Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range  of services to meet the particular needs of patients, with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. In the light of this, a large element of rehabilitation services is provided on a day or community care basis. The relevant services range from specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation through such services as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. These services are often initiated in the context of in-patient treatment for another underlying illness or condition and subsequently continued on a day care basis or in the community, consistent with patients needs. It is, therefore, more appropriate to focus on ensuring that rehabilitation is provided to patients in the most appropriate setting rather than on the basis of identifying dedicated services for particular categories of patients other than those requiring specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation.The provision of appropriate rehabilitation care is also an integral element of the service required by many types of patients and proposals for development of additional capacity in the services that contribute to rehabilitation are often presented in the context of proposals for broader service developments. For example, the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative identified that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of "step-down" or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.Rehabilitation services also have an important role for groups such as people with physical disabilities. Rehabilitation services in this area are provided as part of a comprehensive range of community based services. Since 1997, additional funding of just over €185 million has been invested in the maintenance and development of health related support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with significant disabilities (young chronic sick).In December 2000, I gave approval for the establishment of a project team to oversee the developments at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cork. The establishment of a purpose-built acute rehabilitation unit with associated treatment and ancillary facilities is part of the proposed development. This unit will serve the Cork and the greater Munster region and will provide services similar to those currently being provided in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. A design brief has recently been submitted to the Department.

The problems in the Eastern Regional Health Authority arise primarily due to the high level of demand for assessments combined with current difficulties in recruiting social workers. A range of actions have been taken to assist the ERHA to improve the service available, including allocation of an additional €830,000 over the last four years. I understand that the ERHA is continuing to look at options to further increase the number of assessments carried out, including involvement of other health boards and agencies.

The position is that the cost of capital projects in relation to services for older people must be met from the level of indicative national development plan funding notified to the Western Health Board for the period up to and including 2006. It is a matter for the board to decide on the order of priority of individual projects.In a written communication to my Department earlier this month, the Western Health Board stated that it was its intention to submit a formal proposal to my Department to enable the full refurbishment of the building to take place, that such submission was currently being prepared and would be forwarded for consideration in the very near future. I will give full consideration to this proposal when it is received.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	689	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility – category 1, that is, medical card holders – or limited eligibility – category 2 – for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services, including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	690	A range of dental services for adult medical card holders over 70 years of age are available under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, DTSS, from participating dentists holding contracts with health boards. In 2002, I provided additional funding of €6.166 million to the DTSS in order to meet an increased uptake of it. The scheme is administered by the general medical service payments board on behalf of boards and it is monitored at a local level by principal dental surgeons with a regional responsibility for the DTSS. The guideline time for replacing dentures is every five years; this time-limit may be varied by agreement with the principal dental surgeon in exceptional circumstances. A difficulty with the provision of dentures to medical card holders under the DTSS has already been raised with my Department and this is being addressed through the appropriate industrial relations mechanism.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	691	The provision of dental treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. All health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school.

In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of this year of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This plan is being prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.As part of this work, a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum has recently been established on generic screening. This group is currently reviewing all issues relating to screening, including looking at specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. Their recommendations will help to inform policy developments in this area on an ongoing basis.As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, over 75,000 women have been called for screening and over 55,000 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 73%.

A planning group for the community hospital and the proposed day care centre is also being established and will be requested to prepare the planning brief and bring the project to design stage. Progress on the planning and construction of the community hospital will depend on the availability of the required funding and on the priority accorded to the project by the Western Health Board.

Therefore, my Department has asked the chief executive officer to investigate the issues raised by the Deputy regarding the ambulance service in north Mayo and to reply to him directly.Response times are an important measure of the operational efficiency of the ambulance service and are monitored on an ongoing basis by the individual health boards.

Under the terms of this scheme, persons with an long-term illness card are entitled  to receive drugs and medicines for their specified illness free of charge.The provision of health related services, including therapy services for persons with cerebral palsy is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Since 1997, the Government has provided additional ongoing development funding of almost €11 million for therapy services, including physiotherapy.In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including occupational therapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places.Following the recommendations of this report, I announced in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, on 29 May last, the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places, including 25 physiotherapy places, for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present. The first intake to the extra places is expected to commence in the 2002-03 academic year.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	704	In relation to the scheme operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, my colleague, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has informed me that participants on community employment schemes may retain their secondary benefits, at the level which obtained prior to participation in the scheme, subject to a weekly gross household income limit of €317.43. The retention of the medical card is not affected by the operation of the limit.The key secondary benefits under the social welfare system are rent and mortgage interest supplement, fuel allowance and back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance. In the case of rent and mortgage interest supplement, the payment is phased out over a four year period, with 75% of the claimants previous entitlement being paid in the first year on the programme and 50%, 25% and 25% being paid in the subsequent three years.In relation to retention of medical cards in this area, as part of budget 1996 the then Government announced that "persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment." Persons on the live register for at least one year, who take up paid insurable employment were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance, BTWA, community employment, Jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.The retention of medical card eligibility is approved for a period of three years when a person or the spouse of a person who has been unemployed for a minimum of one year takes up employment. In this context, time spent on the live register, approved schemes or courses for the long-term unemployed is treated as an unemployed period.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	706	A wide range of plans is in train to target health inequalities in accordance with the commitment in this regard in the programme for Government. These plans build on the substantial investment in social inclusion issues made over the period 1997-2002. Plans going forward are set in the context of the national health strategy: Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, which has been identified in the programme for Government as the blueprint for the future direction and development of the health services. One of the key underpinning principles in the strategy is equity. The strategy was developed following an extensive consultation process including that carried out with vulnerable groups as part of the process of developing health targets for the national anti-poverty strategy. These latter have been taken on board as an integral part of the national health strategy. Some examples of plans for targeting health inequalities are outlined below.The health strategy provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and for improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the action required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The target set out in the strategy is that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment.

The current estimated cost for the project is in the region of €60 million. The projected programme for design, build, equip and commissioning of the total project is for completion by 2006-2007. Elements of the project will be handed over in stages. It is not possible at present to give estimated expenditure for each year of the project given the possible implication of future construction inflation and without a design proposal illustrating the phased development of the project. It is a matter for the Midland Health Board to progress the project under the NDP in the light of prioritising capital demands on the funding resources available each year.A design team for the project had been selected by the board and funding of approximately €0.6 million has been provided by my Department in the current year for the preparation of a development control plan for phase 2B.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	742	Article 43 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, S.I. No. 182 of 1997, provides for the issuing of permits by local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association to a person who is suffering from a disability that prevents that person from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking. The regulations do not restrict access to these permits on an age basis.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The Road Traffic Acts and regulations made under those Acts already provide an ample framework for the application of restrictions and prohibitions on the use of roads by traffic generally. There are no restrictions placed on the access of vehicles to urban centres based on occupancy. I have no proposals at present to apply such restrictions.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	744	In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. The age and consequently the first-test-due date is determined by reference to the date of initial registration of the vehicle with subsequent test-due dates falling every two years after the first test-due date. Where a NCT inspection does not occur on the original test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test-due date. This is to ensure that the car is again liable for a test in accordance with the test schedule laid down in the directive. As ownership is not a criterion in determining the test due dates, I have no plans to change the current arrangements.

The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The position in relation to early release for these prisoners has been stated on numerous occasions by both my predecessor and the Taoiseach.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I am informed by the Garda authorities that on the 7 May 2002 a community meeting was held in the above mentioned locality which was attended by public representatives, Dublin City Council, local residents and the gardaí. As a result of this meeting, it was decided to increase the number of both foot and mobile patrols carried out in the area on a daily basis.

In 1997, the Government established the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care – chaired by my Department – with the responsibility to develop a national strategy for the child care sector to meet the needs of society in general. The expert working group made a series of recommendations to Government in February 1999 on the development of quality child care services to meet the increasing demand by parents for child care places. This report forms the basis of the Government's current child care programme in relation to the development of the supply side of child care.In 1998, my Department developed the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 1998-1999 which provided funding under a broad range of initiatives from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. The programme had a budget of almost €14 million and provided capital grants for the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of 106 community based child care facilities as well as grants towards the cost of two senior level child care personnel in each of 25 identified flagship community projects. Funds were allocated to employer involvement in child care provision, enhancement of the national voluntary child care organisations whose membership base comprises service providers, completion of a national child care census and database and a research project in relation to family friendly policies.

One aspect of this is the introduction of a personal injuries assessment board which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employ ment. I believe that this initiative will reduce the cost of delivering compensation for personal injury sustained in accidents at work and motor accidents and that it should have a significant impact on the number of cases that go to court. I am also having court procedures in general reviewed so as to see how civil litigation can be speeded up.

The advisory committee are also considering applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. When this process is completed, they will submit their recommendations to me and I will then decide on the matter.Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances or needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.The Deputy may wish to note that the number of Garda CCTV systems are to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Tallaght and Waterford. Contracts have been placed in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. It is intended that these CCTV systems will be installed and operational by the end of 2002. The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers soon. Work on installing systems in a further seven areas – Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo – will commence in 2003. This will bring the number of areas where Garda CCTV systems are to be extended to by 2003 to 17 in all.

To date, a number of local authorities working in partnership with the private sector have developed such schemes. In Dublin more than 180,000 households are currently serviced, and it is anticipated that this service will extend to more than 250,000 households by the end of the year. Segregated collection has also been introduced in other areas including Galway, Nenagh, Waterford and parts of Louth and Meath. Repak Limited, the voluntary industry initiative for the recovery  of packaging waste, subsidises packaging waste recovery by local authorities through segregated kerbside collection schemes. Local authorities also have powers under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to require the segregation and separate collection of household waste and I expect local authorities to use these powers where appropriate in support of increased segregated kerbside collection.While my Department's grant scheme for waste infrastructure will provide capital support for recycling facilities, an ongoing subsidy for segregated waste collection is not envisaged. I will continue to monitor and keep under review progress in relation to the expansion of segregated collection of recyclables.

When deciding on planning applications a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities. The planning guidelines on residential density published by my Department in September 1999 indicate that public open space is one of the key elements in defining the quality of the residential environment. The guidelines recommend that the achievement of higher densities must be coupled with a higher standard of residential environment: the provision of higher quality communal and public open spaces is therefore highly important. The guidelines recommend that any acceptance of lower quantitative standards of open space must be accompanied by a parallel increase in qualitative  standards of open space. The guidelines recommend for higher density developments that in greenfield sites public open space should be a minimum of 15% of the total site area and in all other cases it should be a minimum of 10%.The social housing design guidelines published by my Department in September 1999 contain recommendations regarding open space within social housing schemes. They recommend that regard should be had by local authorities to the size of the scheme, the nature of the accommodation being provided, existing open space provision in the area and the requirements of the development plan for the area in deciding on the extent and nature of provision for public open space within a scheme.

However, where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken. To date, such funding has been provided to Dublin City Council under the following schemes: the remedial works scheme which assists local authorities in carrying out major essential works to dwellings in designated estates; the special area regeneration programme which consists of a  once-off programme of upgrading high density older flat complexes; and the redevelopment of a number of seriously rundown flat complexes involving a mix of new building, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement. My Department has provided some €210 million to Dublin City Council under these schemes to date, in addition to the major programme of regeneration of Ballymun.Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works scheme programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock. Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings and Dublin City Council has been advised to this effect.

Nevertheless, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has been in regular contact with the UK's nuclear installations inspectorate, NII, with a view to obtaining as much information as possible with regard to security measures at such facilities. Following the  11 September attacks, the Irish Embassy in London contacted the relevant Government Departments to ascertain the security measures in place at nuclear installations. The embassy was informed by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry, DTI, that it is not UK Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites. However, the DTI indicated that stringent security measures applied and that these were regulated by the DTI's Office for Civil Nuclear Security, OCNS. The OCNS works closely with the UK's health and safety executive, which provides advice on the safety implications of events including external hazards such as plane crashes at nuclear installations. The DTI also confirmed that security and safety precautions at nuclear installations are kept under regular review and that the regulators were reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of the events of 11 September.On 3 November 2001 the head of safety at BNFL, in a speech to a public forum on Sellafield in Drogheda, invited the RPII to assess the BNFL evaluation of the consequences of a large aircraft deliberately crashing into the high level radioactive liquid waste storage tanks at Sellafield. As a follow-up to the BNFL invitation, the RPII and BNFL met in Dublin on 14 January 2002. BNFL outlined its evaluation on a confidential basis, and assured the RPII that the storage tanks are robust enough to withstand such an attack. The issue of security at Sellafield was also raised at a meeting between the NII and the RPII on 30 November 2001. At this meeting the NII chief inspector indicated that he was under instruction not to discuss the details of these arrangements and that any request for such information should be directed to the DTI via the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.The OCNS recently prepared a report for the DTI on the state of security in the civil nuclear industry and the effectiveness of security regulation. This concludes that, inter alia, “stringent security precautions are being taken to protect civil nuclear sites and material in the United Kingdom, commensurate with current threats to national security” and “satisfactory arrangements have also been made with the Ministry of Defence to protect civil nuclear sites from attacks from the air”. However, the RPII has advised my Department that due to UK security restrictions neither BNFL or NII briefings nor the OCNS report provide sufficient technical detail to enable the RPII to evaluate these conclusions.

The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Direct provision came into effect on 10 April 2000.Where a person in direct provision receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child. These rates are currently under review by a working group which was established to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the State where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments will be made by the health board.Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation in direct provision and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to €118.80 per week for a single adult, €197.60 per week for a couple and €16.80 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who arrived in the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to €99.38 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to €269.30 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.

For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or whenever the capital was moved from one investment option into another.Up until 1997, the assessment rates for savings that applied to old age, non-contributory, pensions were: first €253.95, £200.00 – nil; next €476.15, £375.00 – 5%; balance – 10%.Gradually between 1997 and 2000 the method of assessing capital was streamlined across the various social welfare schemes. As the most recent step, my predecessor made provision in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital which came into effect from October of that year. This new method applies to all social assistance schemes, other than supplementary welfare allowance.Under the new method the first €12,697.38, £10,000, of capital is disregarded; capital between €12,697.38, £10,000, and €25,394.76, £20,000, is assessed on the basis of €1.27, £1, weekly means for each €1,269.74, £1,000, of capital; capital between €25,394.76, £20,000, and €38,092.14, £30,000, is assessed on the basis of €2.54, £2, weekly means for each €1,269.74, £1,000, of capital; and capital above €38,092.14, £30,000, is assessed on the basis of €5.08, £4, weekly means for each €1,269.74, £1,000, of capital.The revised arrangements introduced in 2000 considerably benefited both single and married old age, non-contributory, pensioners by up €27.93 per week in the case of single pensioners and €41.90 per week in the case of married pensioners.

Those who do not qualify on age grounds are eligible for free travel if they are in receipt of payments under specified schemes such as the carer's allowance, invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension. Concessions are also made for some widows and widowers whose late spouse had been receiving free travel.There appears to be little demand for a lowering of the qualifying age and, indeed, this did not figure as an issue in submissions received in connection with the review of the free schemes which was published in 2000. In the circumstances, there are no proposals at present to reduce the qualifying age.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	818	The Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, introduced an occupational injuries scheme which replaced the workmen's compensation scheme and provided for compulsory insurance against injury arising out of, and in the course of, employment and against prescribed diseases due to the nature of the employment. Contributions were paid into the occupational injuries fund and a range of benefits were paid from that fund. The occupational injuries fund was merged with the social insurance fund in 1990.The principal occupational injuries benefits payable, at present, are disablement benefit, injury benefit and death benefit pension. The weekly rates of these benefits over the period from 1993 to date is shown in Tables 1 and 2 which follow while the rates of disability benefit and invalidity pension are shown in Table 3. Death benefit pension is the only occupational injury scheme which is payable at different rates depending on death benefit pensions, whether payable to widows and widowers aged 66 and over and those under 66, are paid at a higher rate than similar age related social welfare payments. For example, the current rate of death benefit pension payable to person age 66 or over is €4.40 higher than the rate of old age contributory pension and €6.90 higher than the rate of widow/er's contributory pension. The rate payable to persons aged under 66 is €23.30 higher than the analogus rate of widow/er's contributory pension.The aim of the special increases which have been given to those aged 66 and over since 1998 was to achieve the last Government's priority of the attainment of a minimum rate of €127 a week for all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. This target rate has now been well exceeded for all pensioners.There are a number of important commitments in the new Government's An Agreed Programme for Government in relation to social welfare rates generally; in particular, the Government is committed to increase the level of the basic State pension to €200 per week by 2007. The level of future increases in the rates of occupational injuries benefits generally will be considered in the context of the overall social welfare commitments in the new programme.In addition, the question of providing more preferential benefits as a consequence of accidents at work is one of the issues being addressed in the context of the expenditure review of the illness and disability payment schemes, which is currently being carried out. The findings of this review will guide future policy in this regard, and I look forward to receiving the results later this year.

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied.Having examined all the medical evidence submitted with the application, my Department's chief medical advisor expressed the opinion that the care recipient is not so disabled as to require full-time care and attention. In addition, it was also established that the person concerned does not provide full-time care and attention as prescribed in regulations. Accordingly her application for carer's allowance was refused. She was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.

This respite care grant is payable where a person is entitled to, or in receipt of, carer's allowance during a particular period specified in legislation. This year the period is from 6 June 2002 to 14 June 2002. There is no provision for payment of the grant on a proportional basis.The person concerned was in receipt of carer's allowance at the maximum weekly rate up until 8 April 2002 when the care recipient died. An additional six weeks payment of carer's allowance was also made following the death of the care recipient. As her entitlement to carer's allowance had ceased she has no entitlement to the respite care grant for 2002.

This obligation reflects the general policy of the scheme that, in so far as possible, one-parent families should be maintained by their former spouses or partners rather than have to rely on social welfare support.The person concerned applied for one-parent family payment in January 2002. She was asked by the Department to seek maintenance from her spouse by contacting her local district court clerk, and to forward documentary evidence to the Department that she had done so. Her claim was rejected by the Department when she failed to supply the necessary information.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	837	The Report of the Working Group on Foster Care was published by the Department of Health and Children in May 2001.  The report proposed that the weekly rate of foster care allowance be increased from €90.85 to €253.95 for children aged under 12 and from €108.63 to €279.34 for children aged over 12.In light of the Report of the Working Group on Foster Care, the Government decided to increase the rate of the foster care allowance as recommended while also ensuring that all foster children benefit from the orphan's (non-contributory) pension or orphan's, contributory, allowance.I understand that there were a number of foster carers and members of the Irish Foster Care Association represented on the working group and that there was wide consultation and general agreement on the recommendations of the report. The working group on foster care also highlighted "the need for administrative efficiency in the payment structure as well as the adequacy of financial supports to foster carers".Accordingly, orphan's payments which were formerly paid by my Department on behalf of some children in foster care, are now payable in respect of all foster children. Since August 2001 the orphan's payment is paid directly to the health board, on behalf of, and for the benefit of, children in foster care. It is also the case that an orphan payment will continue to be paid in respect of eligible children up to age 22 where they are in full-time education.Under the new arrangements a foster parent receives a much higher single payment from the health board and no longer has to apply for separate discretionary payments from the health boards or for orphan payments from this Department. This change in arrangements addresses many of the concerns raised by the Irish Foster Care Association concerning the involvement of my Department in foster care situations. It also accords with their strong recommendations that the foster care allowance should be inclusive of all former discretionary payments and entitlements.These arrangements are under social welfare legislation which provides that the orphans payments may be made to the guardian or to another person for the benefit of the child. In the case of children taken into care, the health board is the legal guardian.

A payment of €9 per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional €3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to €12.90 per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the €3.90 per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test, and must live alone or only with other qualified persons.Over the course of recent budgets a number of improvements have been introduced in relation to the operation of the scheme. In the budget of 2001, the duration of the fuel season was extended from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The fuel season now runs from the first week in October until late April. In addition, the means test was eased. Since October 2001 a person may have a combined household income of up to €50.79 per week or savings-investments of up to €41,266.49 over and above their pension and still qualify for a fuel allowance. In the budget of 2002 the payment rate of the standard fuel allowance was increased, with effect from January 2002, from €6.35 to €9 per week.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides support to carers on low incomes who look after people who are in need of full-time care and attention. It is not a payment for caring.The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous in terms of the assessment of household income and it is necessary in order to target scarce resources towards those who are most in need of support. These views were borne out in the review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998.However, to increase the number of carers eligible for carer's allowance, the Agreed Programme for Government commits to the relaxing of the means test so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify. The current weekly income disregard is €191 for a single person and €382 for a couple. Average industrial earnings at December 2001 were €491.30 per week. Further improvements in the means test will be examined in the context of the next budget.

The availability of these benefits are subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions. The PRSI contribution classes which qualify for treatment benefit are A, E, H and P.The PRSI contribution eligibility requirements vary depending on the insured person's age. Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. Persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66.The relevant tax year for claims made in the year 2002 is 2000-01. Currently I have no specific proposals for changing the qualifying contribution conditions. However, my Department monitors the operation of the treatment benefit scheme on an ongoing basis.

These categories comprise a dependent spouse-partner, dependent child or children, a person who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, a person who gives the claimant full-time care and attention if he or she is disabled or a semi-invalid, or a person receiving short-term unemployment assistance.In July 2001, the person concerned applied for the fuel allowance. However, her application had to be disallowed on the basis that her son who was residing with her was not one of the excepted categories of people mentioned above. However, he subsequently applied for and was awarded a carer's allowance with effect from 20 December 2001. As a consequence, his mother would have had an entitlement to the allowance from that date.On this basis, a decision has been made now to award a fuel allowance to the person concerned with effect from 21 December 2001. A cheque for €156.70, representing arrears of the allowance for the 18 week period from 21 December 2001 up to the end of the heating season on 25 April 2002, will be issued to her shortly. In future, this allowance will be paid automatically as part of her pension payment, provided her household circumstances remain unchanged.
