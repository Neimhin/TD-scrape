They are hurting due to people losing jobs, businesses going to the wall and all of the bad news that is being inflicted upon them as a result of all we have seen.This House has been closed down for long enough this summer and it is about time that we got on with the business we were elected and sent here to do.  There is a time and place for parliamentary stunts.  We want to get on with the business that we are here to do.We are about to embark on a debate on what is probably the most serious economic measure ever brought before this House since Independence and we should get on with it.  We will disagree with it but attempts to disrupt the holding of this sitting for which we have been waiting since July last should be ceased.  We should get on with the business.Let us have the arguments during the course of the debate.  We will argue with it.  I have my point of view.  The Labour Party has its point of view.  The members of my party want to have the opportunity of expressing that point of view.  They want to communicate to this House the many things that they have been hearing over the past number of weeks from people all over this country.  The people have sent us here to express that and we should waste no more time and get on with the business of the House.

It is very important that the Opposition exercises itself to its full potential to demonstrate the real vexation and anger of the wider public in relation to these proposals.  Sitting here, willy-nilly, in facilitation of its presentation and passage in this House simply does not achieve that.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 9 p.m.; the proceedings on Second Stage of No. 3 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches of the Minister for Finance and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case, and the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case.  The resumed Second Stage shall be taken at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 September 2009, and shall commence with speeches by the Taoiseach and the leaders of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn Féin, or Members nominated in their stead, who shall be called upon in that order, which shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case, and the speaker in possession shall resume thereafter; the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. tomorrow and business shall be interrupted not later than 7 p.m.  There shall be no Order of Business, Oral Questions shall not be taken and matters may not be raised under the provisions of Standing Orders 21(3) and 32 on that day; Private Members' business, which shall be No. 32, Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2009 — Second Stage, shall be taken tomorrow on the conclusion of the speeches by the Taoiseach and the leaders of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn Féin on Second Stage of No. 3, and shall be brought to a conclusion after three hours on that day.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I oppose the Order of Business on the basis that the Bill being presented to the Dáil today — namely, the National Asset Management Agency Bill — is not the Bill that will emerge at the end of the process, for the simple reason there is no common agreement on this Bill among the constituent parties of the Government or even among the members of the major party in Government.  I am also opposed to it on the basis of my deep concern about the proposed overpayment for the acquisition of assets, which is now commonly seen as a massive bailout for the banks——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	102	——with no bailout for mortgage holders or taxpayers.  I am equally concerned about the absence of any independent review by the Oireachtas of this or any other proposal that may come from the Bill.  In essence, it is a proposal to shift between €50 billion and €60 billion onto the backs of Irish taxpayers.  This is not how we should do business.  I am opposed to the Order of Business for these reasons.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I, too, on behalf of the Labour Party oppose the Order of Business presented by the Government.  The Bill before us, the National Asset Management Agency Bill, is the most important economic legislation that has come before the House since Independence.  Not only today's taxpayers but future generations of taxpayers — our children and even our grandchildren — may pay for decades to come for the measures proposed by the Government today.  The Labour Party is opposed to this legislation and we have proposed an alternative.The circumstances in which we are dealing with this legislation are extraordinary.  First, it is still unclear as to what exactly the Government will put through the House by way of this legislation.  We were told it would be introduced last April.  A draft of the Bill was eventually published at the beginning of August, but that was changed again and the legislation was published a few weeks ago.  We now have been told that further changes may be brought forward, but it is not clear if the Government is in agreement on that.  In any event, we have not got an assurance from the Government as of yet as to what arrangements will be made for debating the Bill in the House.  Up to today the Government was insisting that this Bill would not be debated in the House next week.  I am glad to hear that position may have changed.  The Taoiseach should take this opportunity to confirm to the House that arrangements will be made for the Bill to be debated in the House next week.Arrangements have not being made for the continuation of the debate.  I want an assurance that all members of the Labour Party who want to contribute to the debate on this Bill will have an opportunity to do so and that there will not be an attempt by the Government to introduce a guillotine to the debate.  We have got no assurance in that regard.  Neither have we got any assurance that Committee Stage will be taken in the Dáil Chamber rather than in the bowels of the building in a committee room where it will not get the same degree of either parliamentary or public attention.The arrangements for the taking of this Bill are not satisfactory for the Labour Party.  This is fundamental legislation.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I oppose the Order of Business the Taoiseach has proposed for today.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I join earlier speakers in opposing the Order of Business as presented, which covers not only the business of the House today but tomorrow's business.  There are real concerns that the NAMA proposition — in regard to which we may be merely going through the motions in terms of the taking of the various Stages of the legislation on which there is already a done deal in regard to the Government formation — will be foisted on the Irish people.  It is a proposition that spells economic disaster potentially not only for this but for future generations.  It is as if the Minister for Finance had stood before a slot machine and pulled its arm in the hope that things would turn out right.This is a serious matter and the Taoiseach's continual referencing to this being the only way in which the current difficulties can be addressed is simply not the case.  Alternative propositions have been put forward by all the Opposition parties, including Sinn Féin, for their meritorious scrutiny and debate in this Chamber.  In the way the debate is structured, there will not be an opportunity in the course of the passage of Second, Committee, Report and Final Stages of this legislation to question much of its detail.  We can make our respective contributions but we will not have the facilitation of a question and answer session with the Minister and the Taoiseach to go into the core, nitty gritty and fine detail of the legislation, aspects of which they can, and may, withhold from the Members of the House.The Government does not have a mandate to introduce NAMA.  That is a fact.  It is something on which the Irish people should be asked to pass judgment.  The only way that can be done is in a referendum.  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate here today that he will request that the Government support a request of the President — which she is entitled to do under the Constitution — to refer this matter to the people.  If there is opposition from the Government to such a proposition, there is within the Constitution the right of one third of the Members of this House and in excess of a majority of the Seanad Members to appeal to the President to refer the matter to the people by way of a referendum.  The people, ultimately, should be given the opportunity to pass judgment on this proposition.  We hold strongly to this.  I appeal particularly to the Fine Gael, Labour and Independent Members of the Opposition to append their support to this proposal to petition the President.I, too, have concerns about the ordering of the passage of the further Stages of this legislation.  We have no indication as yet on what is to happen next week, post the week's recess, in order to facilitate the final week of campaigning on the Lisbon treaty.  What are the Government's intentions on ordering this legislation's passage through this Chamber and the Upper House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	105	This Bill is being brought forward by the Government as its response to the necessity to ensure that we have financial stability in this country so that we bring forward in a transparent way the means of solving the problems that have been bedevilling the credit system in the banking sector for some time, and that we do so on the basis of a very considered proposal, which is the National Asset Management Agency Bill, for discussion before the House.  There continues to be a lot of misrepresentation — for whatever reason — about the motivation and purpose of this Bill, none of which is supported by the facts, as will be outlined by the Minister for Finance when he opens the debate today.The Chief Whip has informed me that in the normal course of events the Whips will meet this evening to decide on next week's business.  That is a matter for decision by the Whips.  The Government has made no prior decision on the business for next week.  We decided to come back this week because of the urgency and importance of this legislation to begin the legislative process.  The Minister provided a draft Bill to the House more than seven weeks ago and because of the importance of the legislation he indicated his preparedness from the outset to listen to all and any constructive comment and to see in what way people wished to assist in making sure that we provide a response commensurate to the challenge that faces the economy at this time.  This Bill is a full, comprehensive response by Government to meet the scale of that challenge.  It has the support of the European Central Bank and the IMF and it is in compliance with EU state aid rules.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	107	It is a considered proposition put forward by the House.  As has been said by others, it is a matter for this House in its democratic debate to decide on the merits or otherwise of this legislation.  We are very strong supporters and advocates of this legislation.  We believe it is essential as part of the response of this country to the challenges we face today.  That is the Government's position and we wish to proceed with it on that basis.  We look forward to a debate that can be constructive, if people wish it to be.  People can hold strong views one way or the other, but it is through the democratic debate of this House and the primacy of this House in compliance with the rules that apply to us all that we willperhaps ensure that the people of this country see that this Assembly discharges its duty properly.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I repeat that no piece of legislation that has gone through this House since the foundation of the State has ever cost in the region of what this is likely to cost, whether €40 billion, €50 billion or €60 billion.  The Bill presented to us today will eventually be debated by force of vote in the House.  As I understand it, the Bill does not have the total support of the Government, nor does it have the full support of members of the Taoiseach's party, some of whom have pointed out that changes should be made.  This Bill, therefore, is not an agreed conclusion of the Cabinet.  This is not the way we should do business regarding a matter that is as fundamentally important to our country and all our citizens and taxpayers as this one.I ask the Taoiseach to respond on the basis of whether this is the agreed position to be debated.  As an Opposition party, we have not had full disclosure of the circumstances in which this arose.  I am concerned by reports that some people seem to have freedom of access to the higher echelons of Government on a regular basis.  I am concerned that there is no independent review by the Oireachtas of the appeal system.  On that basis, I oppose the taking of the Order for Second Stage.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	110	On behalf of the Labour Party, I too oppose this proposal.  In doing so, I take issue with the patronising remarks of the Taoiseach in responding to the words of opposition that were expressed on the previous proposal.  He rather patronisingly referred to his willingness to listen to constructive proposals and ideas.  He and the Minister for Finance have been getting constructive proposals in regard to this matter for months.  The problem is that they are not listening to those proposals.  The difficulty we have today is that the Taoiseach and his Government got the country and our economy into this hole in the first place.  We do not have confidence that he, his Government and the measures they now propose will get us out of the difficulty we are in.  We have been putting forward serious proposals and alternatives for some time.  The rather condescending way in which the Taoiseach responded to them in his earlier contribution does not augur at all well for the way in which this debate will be conducted.

As Deputy Gilmore said, it is not only a case of the same political faces who have presided over and deepened the economic crisis the Irish people currently face; it is the advisers and those with whom they consult who have been, over this period of time, an integral part of the writing of the script for where we are today.  Neither these advisers nor the faces opposite should determine how we will get out of this mess.  The Irish people have no faith in this proposition or in the Government.  Although opinion polls are not the best way of measuring public opinion, I have confidence in the recent poll which showed the Government at the lowest ever recorded support level of 20%, with 17% for Fianna Fáil and 3% for the Green Party.  This is a close reflection of the anger and anguish of so many citizens across the length and breadth of the State.If the NAMA proposition is to pass, it should be referred in a call for a referendum to the President.  The most appropriate response the Taoiseach could offer today would be a decision to tender his resignation and to allow the people to have a full opportunity to pass judgment on NAMA and the myriad issues he is currently considering in the context of the preparation of a budget that will significantly affect the least well-off, the most marginalised and those who are finding it difficult to make ends meet.

I was simply making the point in my previous contribution — which was neither patronising nor condescending but simply a statement of fact — that we are open to listening to the points made in this debate because of the importance of the legislation for the country.  I also made the point in my previous contribution that there may be others who wish to put a different proposition, and that the House will divide and decide on that.  I was simply referring to the fact that rather than some of the juvenile behaviour we have had at the beginning of this session, we must get down to the serious business of doing this work because it is what the country requires at this time.

This is yet another failure on the part of the Department to present very important legislation on the rights of citizens to access health and personal social services.  The legislation in question has been promised for many years.  Earlier indications were that the Bill would be published, Second Stage addressed, etc., but in recent years the only answer we receive from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and her Department is that it is not possible to indicate when the Bill would come before us.  This is simply not good enough.  What efforts is the Taoiseach employing to ensure that entitlement and eligibility for health and personal social services will be addressed substantively in the presentation of this long-awaited legislation?

Given the urgency of the issue, is it proposed to introduce amending legislation to change the timing of the Exchequer's rebate of 60% for redundancy payments to provide that such rebates be reduced in cases of profitable trading companies and that payment would only proceed when a company had complied with any findings of the Labour Court or Labour Relations Commission?In light of recent controversy, is it intended to introduce amending legislation to allow Ministers to be held to account for the expenditure of public money in the form of expenses, including excessive expenditure?  Will the Government amend the Standards in Public Office Act to provide for an annual statement of ministerial expenses and to allow the Dáil to question Ministers or former Ministers, regardless of whether they occupy the Office of Ceann Comhairle, about such expenditure?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Legislation is not promised on the first issue.  In recent times, changes have been introduced on internal and foreign travel, as is proper in the new circumstances in which we find ourselves and given the need to ensure we use taxpayers' money and scarce resources in the best possible way.  It is also the case that all such expenses are audited by the Accounting Officers of the respective Departments.

On the first matter, the Minister of State visited Vietnam where he dealt directly with his counterpart on the question of foreign adoptions.  As we all know, this is an important and sensitive matter and one on which the Minister of State has been seeking to make progress.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is active in that area but we have not yet resolved the issue to everyone's satisfaction.

First, when does he propose to introduced the promised European defence agency Bill?  Second, the report of the Standards in Public Office Commission was made in the context of the referendum in July last year.  A request was made to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that legislative sanctions be introduced concerning third parties who failed to provide information on their spending.

Most of the letters end with the same sentence — that signature by Ireland is imminent.  It is now nearly two years since the first commitment was made.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	165	As I go around the country on the Lisbon referendum campaign seeking an endorsement for a strong "Yes" vote, the number of people who express genuine concern about the NAMA legislation is quite astonishing.  No Bill that ever went through the House cost anything remotely in the region of what we are talking about here.  This Bill does not have the support of the people.  It amounts to an act of economic madness to attempt to shift a burden of possibly €40 billion, €50 billion or €60 billion on to the taxpayers' shoulders.  There are alternative ways to have liquidity flow into the banking system.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, rang me last year and asked me if I would support the guarantee scheme for the banks, I said "Yes" because I believe in a vibrant, competitive and energetic banking system.  There are alternative ways of having liquidity flow to business besides what is being proposed in the NAMA Bill.There is a growing body of opinion, both at home and internationally, from very respected people and institutions, that what the Government is doing is wrong.  There are a number of ways by which an alternative can be produced that would be fairer, would protect taxpayers and would not involve paying over the odds.  In addition, it would allow liquidity to flow into business for the protection of Irish jobs.  I am not dogmatic about my party's proposal. which was put out some time ago, because there are no perfect solutions here.  I know that.  In the interests of our country, however, and all the taxpayers, including those who are working and fearful for their jobs, and families watching these proceedings, let me make the Taoiseach a proposition, as leader to leader.  If he is willing to withdraw the Bill, and there is time to do so, my party, for one, is prepared to sit down with the Government to work out a more acceptable and fairer alternative that will not involve taxpayers being exposed to an enormous liability.  It would be fairer, in everybody's interest and would allow for liquidity to flow into the system so that jobs can be protected.  The Taoiseach said earlier that he was open for business.  There is a choice here.  There will be a long Second Stage debate and a long Committee Stage debate also.  He can still withdraw the Bill and do this another way in the interests of all the alternatives and opportunities that exist.  In that way, he would not be locked into a cul de sac and pulled by the nose by the banks in one direction only.  I am making a proposition to the Taoiseach in the interests of Ireland and all our people.  If the Taoiseach is prepared to withdraw it, I am prepared to sit down with him and work out a more acceptable and effective alternative.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	168	This Bill is being brought forward for one purpose, namely, to provide a stimulus to this economy by means of the mechanism we have devised.  Making populist statements about it or misrepresenting it does not help anybody but if that is what the Deputy wishes to convey, I cannot dictate that.Since last April the Minister for Finance has been very clear about putting forward this proposition and, as late as August, he made available to the Deputy an invitation to discuss these matters with his advisers and anyone else the Deputy wished within the Department.  That offer was not taken up and that is a matter for the Deputy.  The issue before the House is that we must take action now to bring forward this proposal.  When we commence the Second Stage debate, we can hear what ideas are in this House but we put forward this proposal following due consideration and careful analysis, having sought advice both domestically and internationally and with the support of institutions that will provide funds for this mechanism in line with guidelines set out at EU level.  This is a considered proposal by Government.  It is being brought forward for the reason of confronting the challenge that faces us today and not for any fearful reason.By bringing forward this proposal, we are giving an opportunity to Members to make their proposals and statements and we will put our position.  We have had a view which, when I mentioned it earlier was regarded as patronising, but which is genuine.  The Government has been open and has set out its preparedness, since it drafted the Bill and put it before everyone because of its complexity, importance and urgency, to listen to any views people have, to discuss them and to see how they wish to proceed.  However, we have to do it in a way we believe has the best prospect of success.The motivation behind the legislation on the part of the Government has continually been characterised in a very negative way by Opposition Members for their own reasons and I cannot dictate those reasons.  I assure them that the motivation for bringing forward this proposal is to achieve the common good and to bring a stimulus to the economy in a responsible way and in a way which has the support of important institutions that are vital to making it work.  That is our sole motivation and, rather than perhaps characterising it any other way, let us get on with the business now.  There is a proposition before the House for discussion.  Let us have a debate and meet, as the Deputy said, the concerns of the people, which are about moving forward, dealing with the issue and not continuing with paralysis by analysis.  This is a considered proposal by Government, which is about to be brought before the House.  Let us get on with the debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	175	As the Taoiseach is set on this road, perhaps he might answer a few questions.  We are proceeding to commence with a debate on the Government's NAMA Bill, which will not be the legislation that will emerge at the end of this process, principally because the Taoiseach's partners in Government and members of his own party have yet to decide what further changes they will demand.Will the Taoiseach explain the circumstances in which an individual, Dr. Bacon, was chosen by Government to produce a report without any other economic analysis or input resulting in the Government  being led down one road only without any flexibility to change?  How much will the Government pay for the loans to be acquired?  Will it be €40 billion, €50 billion or €60 billion?  What discount will be applied?  The taxpayer wants to know this and I would like the Taoiseach to respond to that.Is the Taoiseach prepared to move away from paying the long-term economic value and paying over the odds for assets that, in many cases, are useless?  What guarantee can he give that in the event of the Bill going through, the money acquired by the banks will be available for lending by them to businesses all over the country?  Is it his intention, as reflected by one of his backbenchers, to remove the Minister for Finance from the valuation system in order that there would not be a perception — I do not suggest that the Minister would influence the system — of influence by the Minister of the day on the system?  Is he prepared to deal with that?  As we are proceeding down this road, the Taoiseach might answer these questions.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	178	This is about the Government presenting bonds, which will provide access to ECB funds to provide a stimulus to the economy for the purpose of improving the lending capacity of our banking system.  Throughout the last session, week in and week out, we discussed the insufficiency of lending in the economy.  We are seeking to address that issue through this proposal.  We are not in a position to provide a fiscal stimulus to the economy because of the state of our public finances but a stimulus can be provided through this mechanism.It is, therefore, also not correct to continually portray this as costing the amounts to which the Deputy referred since we are seeking to design a mechanism that will ensure we protect the interest of the taxpayer to the greatest extent possible.  We have no motivation other than that in coming forward with this proposal and enacting it after debate having listened to what Members have to say and making sure we can get this as right as we can.  It is important that it works and what we are seeking to achieve is that the management agency manages the assets in line with guidelines set down by the EU with the support of the ECB, which supports this proposal.

It is on that basis that we put the proposal.  We have considered all the options as we have seen them.  We have brought forward this proposal and we have dealt with all the issues in so far as we can.  We are open to dealing with any issues raised in the debate in so far as that is appropriate or possible.  We are seeking to look to the collective wisdom of the House.  If parties want to proceed in a different way or have a totally different proposal, they are entitled to put their point of view on Second Stage.  That is the way we conduct debate in the House.  When we reach Committee Stage, it will be open to Members to decide what they wish to do at that point.However, the bottom line is we must bring forward this legislation to deal with a fundamental problem affecting the economy generally, taxpayers and business.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I seek the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence before I ask my Leaders' question.  I understand there has been a bad crash on O'Connell Street, Dublin, between a Luas tram and a bus.  I wonder if the Minister for Transport might take an opportunity during the afternoon to report to the House on it and perhaps to exchange views with transport spokespersons.The Taoiseach is asking the people to bear a very heavy load.  The legislation the Government will bring before the House will mortgage the future of taxpayers for decades to come.  He is asking people to consider increases in taxation and cuts in pay.  People are already losing jobs and businesses.  It is a very difficult time.  While the Taoiseach is asking people to do that, we are being informed on a weekly and daily basis of the extent of the waste of taxpayers' money which his Government has presided over for the past number of years.Last week the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on FÁS was issued.  FÁS was going to hold a raffle.  It bought a car for the raffle.  The raffle was never held and the car disappeared.  It ordered a television advertisement for €600,000 which was never screened.  In fairness to the board of FÁS, its members have done the decent thing and offered their resignations.  However, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who was responsible for expenditure 100 times that of the television advertisement and spent some €60 million buying an electronic voting system that was never used, has not resigned and came out at the weekend to justify it.On top of that, we learn of the splurging and indulgence of ministerial expenses over the period of that Government.  I acknowledge the Ceann Comhairle's letter of apology he issued today, but it suggests that this was by no means the exception and appears to be the norm.I saw the Taoiseach giving a number of newspaper and television interviews during the summer recess and I want to put a question to him this afternoon.  Does he accept that the Government he served in for 12 years, during which he was responsible for the Government's finances for four years and which he now leads was responsible for a huge waste of taxpayers' money?  Will he apologise to the Irish people for that waste of taxpayers' money?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	187	It is not a question of seeking to mortgage the future of taxpayers.  We are seeking to crystallise the losses that have to be transparently shown now in order to ensure that international finance will continue to fund our banking system and return it to a viable future for our country.  That is what we are seeking to do.  The Bill is again being portrayed as an attempt to mortgage futures.  It is about trying to make sure that we deal with the present situation to avoid a continuing contraction in the economy by means of improving lending into it.  We are doing it by crystallising losses for banks and those who hold those loans so we can present bonds to obtain money to get it into the economy where is it badly needed for Irish businesses.Another point raised by Deputy Gilmore concerned my time as Minister for Finance.  I stand over the budgets I brought into this House, which were regarded by people in Deputy Gilmore's party and the other Opposition party as being mean and not sufficient.  The critique at the time was that the Government was not doing enough to provide further expenditure programmes in a whole range of areas.  I brought forward surpluses on those occasions——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The people want to know where we are going from here and I am here to say that the initiatives we are bringing forward are seeking to address that problem.Regarding the question of expenditure that was wasted, no Member of the House can stand over wasteful expenditure since it is taxpayers' money.  We have seen accountability being exercised through Comptroller and Auditor General reports on an annual basis in successive Governments.  It is a continuing challenge and the need to reduce and eliminate waste is a continuing challenge that is part of the functioning of Government and of the committees of this House, including the Committee of Public Accounts.None of us holds a brief for that but I want to know what part of the expenditure that related to improvements in pensions and increases in education allocation and the health service people opposed at the time.  The critique at the time was that we were not doing sufficient work in those areas.  That is the record of the time, in respect of what the House thought of what I was doing.I want to make a general point.  At present it is all the more important that taxpayers' money is spent efficiently, effectively and wisely and there is a need to prioritise, eliminate certain programmes and ensure that the manner in which moneys are spent in the course of conducting our public affairs here is such that it has public confidence, and that is the challenge we wish to confront.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The Taoiseach did not understand the question I asked him or has deliberately decided to avoid answering it.  I did not ask the Taoiseach to give his opinion on the waste of public money; I am taking that for granted.  None of us stands over the waste of public money.I asked the Taoiseach if he accepted his Government's responsibility for that waste and if he would apologise to the people for it before he looks them in the eye and asks them to dig into their pockets to pay extra taxes or suffer reductions in services or, in some cases, reductions in pay and loss of employment.  The Taoiseach said none of us holds a brief for waste.  He did hold a brief for waste.  It was his brief.  He was in charge.  His Government was in charge when all of this was taking place and some of his Ministers have direct responsibility for the agencies, Departments and, in some cases, for the direct expenditure involved.We are not engaged in some kind of academic commentary here.  The people of this country are being asked by the Taoiseach and Government to pay now for the consequences of what they did.  In some cases they are being asked to pay for it with their employment and businesses.  They are being asked to pay for it with taxes and the loss of services provided to the public.All I am asking the Taoiseach to do — something he has avoided doing in interviews he gave during the summer — before he says to hardworking people that he wants more money from them in taxes, that he wants to cut their pay or that they might lose their job, is to look them in the eye and say he accepts he has been in Government for 12 years, that he was responsible for the country's finances for four of those and that he is now in charge of the Government, and that he accepts, on behalf of the Government, that a huge waste of taxpayers' money was perpetrated by that Government.  I want him to say to them that he is sorry and say it before he asks them to contribute any more.

It is incumbent on us to make sure we do whatever is necessary and that is why we are bringing forward an expenditure control programme throughout all aspects of services to see where we can find savings and improve efficiencies and effectiveness before we have to ask people to go further than that.

In the history of this State, few subjects have been debated more intensively and more passionately than the Government's proposal to establish a National Asset Management Agency.  Since I published the draft legislation on 30 July last, there has been a fast and furious debate on the airwaves, in the print media, on websites, at public gatherings, at a lengthy Oireachtas joint committee meeting two weeks ago and, I am sure, in many households throughout the country.  This is as it should be.  It is impossible to overstate the fundamental importance of the resolution of our banking crisis to our economic recovery.  A clear understanding of why our banking system got into this crisis is of the utmost importance.  We must learn lessons from this crisis.  We must and will take the necessary steps to ensure we never make the same mistakes again.  I accept the good intentions of most contributors to the debate.  Some of the commentary was ill-informed and some of it, from those who should know better, was mischievous.  Many constructive suggestions and amendments have been proposed, however, and the Government has taken on board the best of them.  I emphasise that I am open to further constructive amendments from Members of this House which will improve the Bill and protect the citizens of the State.Much of the debate has centred on the risk involved in NAMA.  I wish to make it clear that the resolution of the banks' difficulties involves risk the private sector will not take.  That is why the Government, like governments throughout the world, has had to step in.  Another risk that has been less prominent in the debate is the risk to the taxpayer of paralysis and delay.  If we do not act now to free our banks of their higher risk loans, we will not be in a position to benefit from the economic recovery that appears to be emerging in the United States and in Europe.  Without a healthy and functioning banking system, our businesses and service providers will not be able to grow and develop their products for our main markets.  If we do not stand ready to take advantage of a global upturn, as an open free market economy dependent on foreign direct investment and international capital flows, we will lose market share and jobs.  That is the very real risk confronting our economy.  As the time for debate comes to an end, the Government has a duty to act.  Our proposal to establish an asset management agency has received the endorsement of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.  It is clear that our proposal enjoys credibility in the financial markets.  Since it was announced, the cost of borrowing by the State has fallen by 1.5% for ten-year money, which is tangible evidence that the Government's strategy is working.  I note that NAMA has received the endorsement of two of my distinguished predecessors, Mr. Ray MacSharry and Mr. Alan Dukes, both of whom sat at the desk I currently occupy at another period of great peril for this country's economy.  In light of their record of service during difficult periods, their assessment is deserving of our respect.  The citizens of this country are understandably angry about the state of the banks, bitterly disappointed by the failure of our regulatory system and appalled by the details of the reprehensible behaviour of people in the financial and property sectors, in whom they placed their trust.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	206	They are also angry with the Government.  Many of them have asked why we are putting money into the banks while they endure the brunt of the difficult budgetary decisions we needed to take.  It is unfortunate that there has been a breakdown of trust in the entire banking system, but the public knows we need the banks.  People understand that we cannot have economic recovery unless we fix our banking system.  It is not just a question of bank guarantees, recapitalisation and asset management solutions for impaired assets.  It is a question of something much more fundamental and tangible.  People need to be reassured that their deposits are safe.  They need to believe that senior management and directors in the banks are responsible, trustworthy and accountable for their actions.  This will not happen overnight.  It will require much hard work on the part of all of us.  We must overcome our understandable anger and get on with the business of reform.  The Government is determined to refashion the financial and banking system and to address and correct all regulatory and governance shortcomings.  We will give clear direction to the banks about what is expected of them.  As I stand here today on behalf of the people of Ireland, I wish to make it clear that the banks should be extremely grateful for the continued support and forbearance extended by the citizens.

This Bill is the centrepiece of the Government's plan to resolve the problems that have beset our financial and credit system.  Before I deal with the details of how NAMA will work, I will set out the context in which the decision to establish the agency was taken.  Just under a year ago, the banks in this country were on the brink of financial collapse.  The well-being of our nation and our people was under threat.  The State guarantee, which was introduced overnight on 29 September 2008, pulled us back from the brink.  As a result, our banks and financial institutions were again able to raise from international markets the funds they needed to ensure their customers — big or small, young or old — could go about their daily business in the knowledge that their deposits were secure.  In the year and, especially, the months before the guarantee, our banks were squeezed by the severe correction and withdrawal of funding that took place in the international markets.  This correction followed a period of unsustainable cheap credit and inadequate regulation of the global banking system.  The failure of the Lehman Brothers international investment bank and the decline in other global financial institutions further exacerbated the position.  Smaller and more open economies like the Irish economy were particularly badly affected.Having moved away from more traditional forms of funding, with balance sheets expanding by more than 100% in a few short years, Irish banks availed more than most of cheap credit.  They borrowed in the short term to fund long-term assets and extensive property-based lending.  When this cheap credit dried up overnight, the Government, like most governments in the developed world, had to step in.  As other countries followed our example in the use of guarantees, funding conditions became extremely difficult for Irish banks and building societies once more.  Large levels of speculative property lending left the banks exposed to a property market that had passed the peak of its cycle.  The property industry shuddered to a halt.  Sales of houses and other property stopped and repayments of interest and capital could not be met by borrowers.  International providers of funding and capital recognised the risks, cut credit lines and, in some cases, stopped dealing with financial institutions.  In this weakened state, our banks started to hoard capital to protect themselves.  Stress on their capital and funding positions damaged their ability to provide an essential flow of new and existing lending to the economy.  To address this problem and to further stabilise the system, the Government moved to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland.  As details of the shameful behaviour of some senior executives in Anglo Irish Bank began to emerge, that bank was taken into State ownership to prevent it from destabilising the rest of the banking system and the economy.  As we know, these events are the subject of a number of investigations, which I hope will conclude sooner rather than later.  It suffices to say that the damage done by certain individuals to the reputation of this country will take some time and much hard work to repair.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	214	It is important to remember that the Government's support for our banks has not been unconditional.  Financial benefits have accrued to the State from the fees related to the guarantee, which will amount to €1 billion.  The State also holds warrants for a 25% shareholding in AIB and Bank of Ireland, which have gained significant value since the investment.  Operational restrictions have been imposed on the banks.  Executive pay has been limited.  New rules have been imposed on the banks in their dealings with business customers and residential mortgage holders.  Nor has State support saved the banks from losses in this crisis.  Shareholders, many of them ordinary citizens saving for their future, have suffered from enormous falls in share values and banks have taken large losses on their loan books.  Subordinated bondholders have also been hit, with a large amount of subordinated debt being bought back by the banks in recent months at a significant discount.  The outcome of these transactions was a loss representing approximately €4 billion to these bondholders and a material contribution to the capital required for the institutions.I want to reiterate that in all our actions over the past year, our sole concern has been the best interests of the wider economy.  The simple fact is that credit remains the lifeblood of any economy.  It allows businesses to source funding for productive developments and to foster creativity and innovation so that we can become a more competitive, export-orientated economy.  It allows individuals to access mortgage funding and finance the purchase of consumer goods.  The only way to restore the flow of credit is through a cleaned up banking system.That is precisely why the Government has decided to set up the National Asset Management Agency.  NAMA will facilitate the speedy removal of higher risk property related assets which are clogging up the banks' balance sheets and greatly hampering their ability to lend to creditworthy individuals and households and thereby support economic activity.  This general approach to dealing with distressed assets has been supported and recommended by banking experts across the globe.  The model has been successfully implemented in a number of countries in the past where similar issues with problem loans have arisen.  Countries such as Germany and the UK are also introducing asset relief schemes.  Indeed, the European Commission has issued state aid guidance in this area specifically to assist member states that have chosen to take steps to establish asset relief schemes.  International agencies such as the IMF and the ECB have commented favourably on the approach.  In other words, this is a proven policy response which has been successful elsewhere and will be successful in Ireland.As we rebuild our banking infrastructure we must reform our oversight mechanisms so that our regulatory and supervisory system ensures we have a banking system that is fit for purpose, supports economic recovery and will prevent the economy from being undermined by rogue and undisciplined actions within the sector.Turning to how NAMA will operate, individual institutions must apply and be accepted as participating institutions.  The Bill includes fair and objective criteria for the selection of the institutions that would participate in NAMA consistent with the EU state aid guidelines.  As I made clear at the discussion with the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the draft National Asset Management Agency Bill on 31 August, under the legislation any credit institution in Ireland can apply for participation in NAMA and each application will be assessed strictly in an objective and non-discriminatory manner in accordance with the statutory criteria included in the Bill and EU state aid requirements.  With this in mind, I will be proposing a Committee Stage amendment to section 60 of the Bill to increase from 30 to 60 days the period of time that credit institutions have to apply for designation as participating institutions in NAMA to facilitate the application process.The figures I am presenting today relate to five institutions, namely, Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  These are the institutions in which we have had the opportunity over the past year to carry out the necessary due diligence, analysis and stress testing.  The agency will buy the land and development property loans and certain associated loans from the banks at prices well under the current book value.  It will then manage these loans over time to achieve the best possible financial return for the taxpayer.  NAMA will start with the largest systemic exposures across the institutions and it is expected that by the middle of next year most of the loans will be transferred.  NAMA will leave behind smaller, cleaner and better funded banks that can focus their resources on their core function of lending to the productive economy.It is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital.  I want to make it clear that the Government would expect such an institution to explore all available options for raising such capital.  It is the Government's preference that private market solutions are found and implemented.  The banks and building societies will be expected to increase the equity component of their capital base as the NAMA asset transfers are implemented.  To the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing such banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements.  This will be done in a manner consistent with EU state aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy.  Any recapitalisation of a credit institution in such circumstances must be followed by restructuring in a manner which complies with EU state aid requirements.  Not only is this a bare EU requirement, it is essential that restructuring takes place side by side with capital investment.It is expected that NAMA will purchase loans with a book value of approximately €77 billion.  The approximate breakdown is as follows: Allied Irish Banks, €24 billion; Anglo Irish Bank, €28 billion——

It is projected that 36% of the assets will be land, 28% development property and 36% in associated commercial loans.  The estimate is that 40% of these loans are cash flow producing.  The cash flow produced will be sufficient to cover interest payments on the NAMA bonds and operating costs.  The geographical breakdown of the assets is about two thirds in Ireland, one fifth in Great Britain, 6% in Northern Ireland and most of the remainder in the USA and Europe.The price to be paid for these assets will be a lot less than their €77 billion book value.

This strikes a balance between reflecting the long-term potential of these assets while minimising any potential risk that NAMA will make a loss.The legislation sets out a comprehensive methodology on how assets will be valued and I am publishing today draft valuation regulations which provide further detail on the valuation process.  This valuation framework must accord with EU state aid guidance and is subject to EU approval.  Application of the valuation methodology is a complicated and extensive process and it must be remembered that each loan must be valued individually in accordance with the methodology.  In that context, any estimate of the price to be paid for the assets is provisional in nature.  From our estimates, it is expected that NAMA would pay approximately €54 billion in relation to the €77 billion in loans.  This is an estimated aggregate discount of 30% and the final figure will depend on the detailed evaluation of each individual loan.  Nevertheless, it is essential for this House and the Irish people that an estimate be provided at this stage.The final figure will only arise if the Oireachtas enacts this legislation and the individual valuations are completed.  Loan quality, geographic distribution and type of loan will all vary from institution to institution.  These figures cannot be applied to extrapolate to individual portfolios or loans.  It is essential to the NAMA process that final decisions on these kinds of numbers will be made only after an exhaustive bottom-up valuation process.  The valuation process will be designed to meet the standard that will be expected by the EU Commission.The estimated current market value of these assets is €47 billion.

In addition, we intend to introduce a levy if on the winding up of NAMA there were to be a deficit.Finally, I should note that the State owns 100% of Anglo Irish and, currently, substantial economic interest in the two largest banks.

Let me repeat this point: the protection for the taxpayer of the risk sharing mechanisms, and if necessary a levy, will ensure that any unjust enrichment of private shareholders by paying an allowance over current market value can be recouped, but of course if NAMA makes money, this will accrue to the taxpayer.

Let us put that figure in perspective; assuming that NAMA were to dispose of the majority of its assets in the second half of the decade, this uplift in property values would be achieved even if values kept pace with general consumer price inflation.  In that case, real — that is, inflation adjusted — property prices in ten years' time would still be 45% below their values of late 2006.  To be clear, there is no assumption in our work that peak property prices will be repeated.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. John Hurley, and the incoming Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, have stated to me that having regard to the uncertainty in property price movements, the proposed add-on of 15-18% to the estimated current market price does not seem out of proportion with the range of potential upward price movements, especially when a risk sharing element is included.

The agency will have a statutory duty to maximise the taxpayers' return and will therefore be expected to use all of its means to this end.  The Bill provides the agency with a wide range of powers it needs to pursue borrowers and enforce security.  In some cases this will mean that borrowers' personal assets will have to be assumed by NAMA.I am also conscious of the need to avoid a repeat of the current position in the market for development land.  A requirement has been included in the Bill obliging NAMA to have regard for the need to avoid undue concentrations or distortions in the market for development land.  I intend to issue guidelines governing the agency's interaction with borrowers in the completion of properties acquired by NAMA.The banking system has let us down.  However, it can revive and serve our economy in a proper manner, but the existing structures cannot remain the same.  Already a number of banks are developing restructuring plans to tight deadlines to meet EU requirements arising from recapitalisation options.  Any institution participating in NAMA will be required to restructure its operations and I will be insisting that this is a real process leading to a reformed and re-invigorated banking system.  It is too early to outline a definitive shape for the new system and there must be scope for subsidiaries of external banks to play their full part.  This will be the focus of my work in the coming weeks.I referred earlier to the importance of the bank guarantee scheme in stabilising the banking system following its introduction last year.  In June last, I introduced changes to the scheme as part of the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which allowed for the extension to the Government guarantee contained in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 beyond the current expiry date of 29 September next year.  As I announced in the supplementary budget, the guarantee will be amended to facilitate access for Irish financial institutions to longer term debt.  I propose to adjust the current guarantee but retain all of the most important features.  The details of this will be published on my Department's website this afternoon.  The new scheme will be somewhat more targeted.  It will allow for greater long-term debt issuance under the guarantee, moving it more towards the European model.  The revised guarantee scheme will represent the necessary first step in an exit strategy for the State from the blanket guarantee offered in September 2008.  However, it is clear that the stability provided by the guarantee remains important and it will remain extensive and retain the blanket guarantee for deposits.A key feature of the modified guarantee scheme is that it allows the covered institutions to access un-guaranteed funding.  Over the past month certain Irish institutions have started taking the first steps towards issuing un-guaranteed term debt and I very much welcome this positive trend and sign of improved vitality in the banking system.  EU State aid approval for the scheme is at an advanced stage.  A formal market notice will be issued later this month once Commission approval has been secured and I anticipate that I will bring the necessary statutory instrument to commence the scheme before the House in early October.The funding advantages provided by NAMA, together with the continuing support of the guarantee scheme, will underpin the stability of funding for the Irish financial system.  The House will be aware that market participants pay keen attention to our debates on financial matters.  For the avoidance of doubt in the market, all liabilities covered under the existing guarantee on liabilities, known as the CIFS scheme, will remain fully guaranteed until 29 September 2010.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The Central Bank of Ireland is taking its position at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight.  Professor Patrick Honohan will succeed Mr. John Hurley as Governor later this month.  I thank both of them for their assistance.A new head of financial supervision will be recruited shortly.  New resources and additional expert staff will widen skill sets and expand and enhance the capacity for the reformed institution.  I expect the draft legislation providing for the reform of the regulatory system to be published before the end of the year.As part of the reform package for financial regulation and longer term planning, I am looking at options for a legislative regime to deal systematically with distressed financial institutions.  I want to ensure that the State has in place a range of tools to protect deposit holders and ensure we can deal effectively with problem institutions and at the same time maintain the confidence of international markets.  My officials and the relevant authorities are examining the scope of such a regime.  I hope to bring forward proposals in this area early in the new year.Everybody in this House is aware of the effect of the crisis conditions of the last year in the availability of credit to businesses and households.  The flow of credit is essential to the proper functioning of the economy.  All of the Government's actions in stabilising the banks have been undertaken to ensure that the financial system continues to fulfil its essential functions in providing credit for businesses and individuals.  The establishment of NAMA and the removal of identified risky assets from the balance sheets should in itself improve credit supply.  The basic business model of a bank — and what generates profits — is on-lending at a margin appropriate for the risk involved.  This proposal allow banks to focus on this and addresses the two key existing limitations to new lending.  First, it will strengthen and improve the funding position of the banks meaning they have available funding to on-lend.  The simple fact is that every euro lent by a bank to a customer must be drawn from deposits or borrowed by the bank from somewhere else.  The agency will pay for the loans by giving the banks Government bonds that can be swapped for cash in international markets and at the European Central Bank.  Second, the removal of higher-risk assets will allow banks to focus their human and capital resources on their core business rather than trying to work out problem loans.  Every new loan requires new capital and banks in their current position need to maintain existing capital buffers to absorb current and future losses.Specific credit supply measures were incorporated into the Government's recapitalisation packages for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Credit for small and medium-size enterprise — SME — has been a particular focus of concern.  As part of the package each bank committed to increasing capacity for SME lending by 10%, established a €100 million fund for clean energy and environment-friendly investment and a further €15 million for seed and venture capital.  The banks report on all of these commitments quarterly and their reports are monitored by the Financial Regulator.  The reports clearly show that new business lending is taking place month by month, although at a lower rate than last year, and that substantial numbers of new business accounts are being opened each month.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has established a credit clearing group involving business groups, banks, State agencies and Departments which is examining cases of credit refusal referred to it and an e-mail postbox has been set up to facilitate referrals.  In addition, that Department is operating the stabilisation fund and the temporary employment subsidy scheme to help viable businesses get through their current difficulties.To summarise, the Government has made lending to small and medium-sized enterprises a major priority.  Various actions have been taken to support viable businesses, to track the real situation and to facilitate access to credit on a proper commercial basis.  In terms of specific credit supply measures attaching to NAMA, the Government continues to examine options in this regard and I look forward to the debate in the House.Some have argued for alternative approaches.  As I discussed earlier the risk to the taxpayer of overpaying for assets by paying an allowance for long-term economic value can be mitigated by risk sharing mechanisms and the levy.  I wonder if those who argue that NAMA should ignore the fact that the market is currently distressed and that the institutions should be paid current market value realise the cost implications of what they are proposing.  The additional capital required by the institutions compared to what might be required under the NAMA approach would be in the region of €4 billion to €7 billion.  The capital would have to be provided——

On the assumption, as Deputy Burton indicated in public interviews, that there should be a 50% discount on the loan book, it would require the State to borrow an additional €10 billion to €14 billion to recapitalise the banks.  Even under the benign assumption that additional borrowings of this scale would not affect the interest rates on Government bonds, the interest costs of this additional capital would be between €600 million and €700 million each year.  That is some mortgage to put around the Irish people'snecks——
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	274	——and that mortgage could be put around the Irish people's necks here and now, not in ten years time.Of equal concern is the damage that would be done to any possibility of recovery in the financial system.  The new capital injections would lead to effectively full nationalisation of the banking system.  Full nationalisation is Labour Party policy, but it carries with it a very real possibility that those who provide our banks with the funds they need to continue their operations would reduce their level of funding.  The simple fact is that it is easier for a commercially orientated banking system to attract the funding it needs to provide credit for the economy.  A forced nationalisation of the system would involve significant risks of reduced funding opportunities for the banks.  Against a context of the global funding crisis, these are risks we cannot afford to take.

It is strongly the view of this Government.  NAMA will ensure that credit flows again to viable businesses and households by cleansing the balance sheets of Irish banks.

It will ensure that we avoid the Japanese outcome of zombie banks that are just ticking over and not making a vibrant contribution to economic growth.

This asset management approach protects taxpayers.  The evidence from property busts in other countries shows that the longer bankers and borrowers are allowed to deny the reality of the losses they face, the greater the ultimate cost to the taxpayer and the general damage to the economy.  Cleaning the balance sheets of the riskiest classes of assets allows the management to refocus operations towards lending to small and medium-sized firms and away from property speculation.

It comprises more than 200 sections and I propose to outline the principal aspects of each part.Part 1 sets out in detail the purposes of the Bill and includes some general provisions such as the definitions used in the legislation. It also includes a provision dealing with the sanctioning of certain offences committed under the Bill.Part 2 deals with the purposes, functions and powers of NAMA.  NAMA will have all powers to enable it to achieve its purposes and to carry out its functions.  In particular, it will have all necessary commercial powers of a financial asset management company, enabling it to take full and determined action in relation to bank assets acquired.  The agency has established the appointment of a board and a CEO and related provisions are in place.  As in the case of the appointment of public interest directors to the banks, I will, of course, consult with the leaders of the Opposition parties before making any appointments, either to the chair or the board or NAMA.

Part 5 sets out the methodology for the valuation of the assets.  Part 6 provides generally for the mechanics of the acquisition of bank assets.  Part 7 sets out two appeal mechanisms for participating institutions.  If Members of the House want to devise a valuation method, as Deputy Kenny suggested earlier, that deprives me of an involvement in this position, I am quite happy with such an amendment as long as it establishes and protects the position of the taxpayer.

Economic recovery is dependent on three key factors.  The first is getting the public finances back in order.  That work is well under way and will be debated in this House when I bring forward the budget in December.  The second is restoring our competitiveness by reducing our cost base.  The final key element is a healthy banking system that will serve the needs of the wider economy.  Without a properly functioning banking system, we will not have economic recovery.  It is as simple as that.  Having stabilised the financial institutions over the past year, we must now move to cleanse them of their infection and return them to full health.  The necessary controls have been included in our plan to ensure that the interests of taxpayers have been and will be protected throughout the process of repair.  The reforms I will introduce to our regulatory and supervisory structures will ensure that there will be fair, but forceful, oversight of the banking sector.I thank those in various Departments and Government agencies as well as my financial and legal advisers who have worked incredibly hard over the past year in highly pressured conditions to deal with this crisis.  The suggestion that, in setting up NAMA and in drawing up this legislation, they were somehow colluding in some conspiracy to protect narrow sectional interests is unworthy of any Member of this House.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I move amendment No. 2:
To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:"Dáil Éireann declines to give the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 a Second Reading because:1. The Government has published neither the Bacon report that underpins the NAMA proposal nor any proper analysis of this enormous initiative in terms of:a. The enormous risks for taxpayers of using a dubious and politically influenced valuation methodology to pay €90 billion for assets of highly uncertain long-term value;b. The growing doubts regarding its impact on bank lending;c. The growing concerns from creating a secretive, politically directed, state-managed, tax funded work-out process for 1,500 property developers.2. The Government has not facilitated a review by the Oireachtas of independent analysis of alternative banking solutions which international evidence suggests are likely to be more effective at getting credit flowing, less costly and fairer for the taxpayer and less vulnerable to political manipulation and business lobbying.".This is a decision of truly enormous proportions.  The Minister is asking us to make a commitment on behalf of the taxpayer today of €54 billion.  That is the highest commitment ever made by any Minister in any Act before a Parliament.  It represents for every family in the country €34,000 of mortgage that they are being asked to pay in order to purchase these impaired loans from the banking system.  The crisis we are now facing has not happened because some tsunami has swept onto our shores from international waters and engulfed us.  This has happened because of catastrophic policy failures.  It was the Government's regulatory system that failed to call a halt.  It was its public finance policy that led to reckless overspending and exposure of the taxpayer.  With its system of cosy relationships, it refused to confront problems and instead sought to buy them out and cosy its way around them.  It is those problems that have left us in the hole we are now in.  Those problems led to the easy money and the runaway property bubble that have brought our people to their knees.The taxpayer is being asked today not only to buy these impaired loans, but as the Minister has said also to pay €7 billion extra for them over their market value.  That is an extraordinary amount of money.  Remarkably, this extraordinary decision is being taken without any forensic analysis of the costs and benefits of this approach or of the risks and threats that are clearly involved.  It is happening at a time when funding is being slashed for many important needs in our community, including investment in vital infrastructure, care for extremely sick people and support for disabled children.  It behoves us to treat this as real money because real money is what it is.  This €54 billion is not, as the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, seems to think some sort of fairy money on which we do not need to pay the interest or ultimately pay it back.  This is real money.  We pay the interest on it and we need to pay it back.  It ultimately falls on the taxpayer and our children who need to service that debt.Let us be under no illusions about the decisions we are about to take.  If we get this wrong — I believe we are getting it wrong — we will undoubtedly prolong the recession that our people will face.  We will increase the number of job losses in businesses around the country if we get this banking solution wrong.  Let me try to assess what we have heard today.  We have heard that the write-down is to be 30%, which is strikingly low.  On behalf of the Green Party, Ministers and spokesmen were saying it needed to be at least a 50% write-down on the loans.  We have now moved away from that.  As recently as 31 August the Minister advised the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that we were protected by an equity buffer of 25% in these loans.  Today, the Minister was forced to reveal that that is not 25%, but half of that and he has only taken one element into account to determine that half of it has disappeared and that is rolled up interest.  I wonder how much more will disappear before we find the truth of the matter.We were told that the €7 billion step-up would be allocated 50-50 between senior and subordinated bonds.  However, it is not being shared 50-50.  Only one third of the extra will be shared through subordinated debt.  Already, what seemed to be pillars of the new approach are being hacked away at.Remarkably, we are told the taxpayer must pay a 15% mark-up on the value of the loans.  Where is the underpinning for that?  What evidence has the Minister offered to support his contention that we must pay that?  He suggests there will be a bounce-back in prices of at least 10%.  Where is his evidence?  A reputable commentator — one of the few who forecast the crash — has told us a further 20% fall in property prices is likely.

Yet he has not offered supporting evidence for this.  It is extremely worrying that we are being asked to make this decision without access to proper evidence.  This goes to the core of the issue.One thing Irish people have learned over the last seven years is not to accept glib assurances from Ministers that everything will turn out all right on the night.  Many of those who are telling us today there is no alternative to NAMA are the same people who told us the property price rises were based on sound economic fundamentals.

The new creed is the notion of long-term economic value, which has replaced the concept of sound economic fundamentals.  It is telling us that for these people the dream lives on: a bounce-back is just around the corner.

The Irish taxpayer is being asked to pay more than the value of these loans because the Minister or one of his advisers believes things will be rosy.  There is no buyer who goes out and pays over the ante in the marketplace on the basis that things will get much better.  There is no sound reason the Irish taxpayer should be paying over the ante either.There are also those who say to us we should don the green shirt.  Now is the time to rally round; let us all put our shoulders to the wheel.  People who say we should support proposals whether they are right or wrong are leading us down the wrong route.

That, again, is a dangerous route.  The patriotic thing to do now is to ask the hard questions, put this under real scrutiny and expose the fact that we are making a mistake.  We are embarking on a ship that is not seaworthy and heading in a direction that will not save the Irish taxpayer or the economy.  We must, even at this late stage, reconsider what is at stake.  This is a major decision and we must do everything in our power to get it right.  It has engendered unprecedented debate, as any Member who looks at his or her e-mails every day will see.  We should be proud that people are really engaged.  There is intense anger and rage at times about what is involved, but we must channel that rage to make sure we decide on this proposal in a mature way.  We are determined in this Second Stage debate — the debate on the principle of the Bill — to fight tooth and nail against this decision, because we are convinced the Minister is making a mistake we will pay for.Our approach to resolving the banking crisis starts by determining the problem we are attempting to solve.  We need to get credit flowing for ordinary businesses and families so that jobs can be protected.  That is what we need to do, not bail out bankers or developers.  We must sustain a financial system that can support employment.  At times the Government has lost sight of this important distinction.  It is a distinction economists would make: which parts of the bank are systemically important and which are not?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The Government is unwilling to discuss the notion that there are elements of the banks that are good and need protection and elements that are bad and do not need to be protected.Fine Gael's approach to this has led us to separate the flow of credit solution from the bank resolution solution.  We are doing that for sound reasons: we can use public money more effectively if we make that distinction.  This means establishing a national recovery bank and using €2 billion of taxpayers' money to put credit straight into the arteries of businesses who need it.  This idea was debunked by Ministers and spokespersons on the other side, I recall a mention of fantasy banks.  However, such a scheme was up and running in France within months.  RTE had a piece last night in which this was described.  This is not something that is bizarre and extraordinary, as Ministers would like to pretend, but something other countries are doing, which is working.  These institutions are providing credit to businesses who will not get credit from zombie banks.  That is an important point.The second phase should be a bank resolution system which is designed to give the banks themselves the opportunity to work out their problems.  They created them; let them work it out and take the primary responsibility.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Hear, hear.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	342	We will stand at the ready to protect and save what is systemically important in the banking system so that if the banks cannot meet stress tests and must come to the State for aid, it will clearly be on the basis of saving what is important — the parts that will keep our economy, our businesses and our families going — but leaving certain investors to deal with the toxic loans and the bad decisions they made.  That is an important distinction.This approach to bank resolution has many positive aspects that do not feature in NAMA.  The risks and the responsibility for working out problems will remain with those investors who created them and the losses that occur will be first borne by those professional investors who made them.  That is an important principle and goes to the core of many people's concerns about NAMA.  It also establishes a way of accessing money from the ECB and from markets, not to support impaired loans and nurse them along but to get money to businesses that need it.  This is also important.  It avoids creating a State-run property monopoly with all its attendant dangers, which have been analysed elsewhere, and exposure for the taxpayer.  If there is one thing we have learned in 20 years of politics it is that if we mix political power with property ambitions it is an explosive combination and contrary to the public interest.  The idea of a State-controlled monopoly, operating in a secretive way, is going back down a road we should have learned, at our cost, not to embark upon.Our proposal also offers a coherent framework not only for this banking crisis but for the behaviour of banks in the long term.  We, the Oireachtas, and the Irish public see a distinction between what is systemically important within the banks and deserves our support and protection, and what is not.  We will know the sort of lending practices and activities that we will not be supporting, and banks will know about this approach now and for the future.  This is an important principle that we ought to enshrine in our approach to this.Most importantly, the proposal does not use scarce public money to nurse along the impaired loans but to help with export-led recovery.  It avoids the debate about the need to value these impaired loans, where there are major risks even if we are using market values, as many have pointed out.  It also avoids us crystallising all these losses up-front, which we do not seek to do.  I heard the Taoiseach say this process is all about crystallising losses.  It is all very well to talk about crystallising the losses, which were created by investors in the bank, but the impact for the Irish taxpayer of the crystals the Taoiseach talked about creating will be felt like shafts of glass in terms of what he or she will have to pay.  That is the crystallising process the Taoiseach is creating.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The Taoiseach is shifting the burden from where it was created to the taxpayer.  That is not the correct approach we should adopt.NAMA fails the critical tests of being effective, fair and of involving the least cost.  It does not square up to those criteria.  Its origins do not start with the needs of enterprises and families.  It does not distinguish the important part of banking from the unimportant part.  It is built on the silly notion that in order to protect our reputation we have to stop the laws of capitalism as it deals with investors, bondholders and subordinated bondholders in our banks.  It places the objective of keeping the banks in private ownership on a pedestal above all other considerations, a pedestal on which it does not deserve to be placed.Having listened to what the Minister said and the various changes announced or suggested by backbenchers, the fundamental principles of NAMA are still the same.  It is the determination to pay hope value for these loans purchased, €7,000 million in excess of their actual market value.  Asset recovery will still be operated as a politically controlled bureaucracy.The conduct of this public business will be done under a veil of secrecy.  There is an innocent faith at the root of it that the banks will suddenly lend.  It is now the eleventh hour and the legislation is about to be passed and we have yet to see any aspects of the mechanism the Minister has told us he is dreaming up to make sure that NAMA gets credit flowing to business.  We have been told that a mechanism is being hatched together——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Once one decides to pay hope value instead of market value, one destroys the concept of fairness.  It implies that taxpayers are being forced to pay more for what they are getting than what they ought to pay.  That approach destroys the concept of fairness.There is plenty of international evidence to show that the state is not good at running asset recovery.  When political objectives are involved — one of the Government's considerations is to bring new political objectives such as various social objectives into the asset recovery process — and once one starts down the road of making political deals, sweetheart deals and special concessions for some social purpose, the evidence shows that one undermines and destroys the capacity of an asset recovery system to work.The Minister's assurances are worth very little when the evidence shows that these systems have not worked where they have been tried elsewhere.  They worked in one country, Sweden, which nationalised its banks first and then ran a tight system.  However, let us be clear, Ireland is not like Sweden.  When it comes to the relationship between property and politics and business, Ireland is not like Sweden.  We have to put in place protections, which the Swedish people appear to have in their DNA.

He has learned the wrong lesson.  The problem with Lehman Brothers was that its collapse spread panic because there was no framework for managing what it was doing.  It was not the case that it was letting investors and bondholders suffer losses; that was not what was wrong.  However, the Minister seems to believe that if we let any bondholder in our banks compulsorily lose money the world will fall in on top of us and we will not be able to borrow any more.  Let us be blunt; these debts were not debts of the Irish people.

The interests of foreign investors considering investing in Irish Government paper are the same as those of the Irish taxpayer.

The mistake the Minister is making is that he believes that bondholders cannot discriminate between investments made in banks and investments made in a sovereign state that is determined to manage its affairs effectively.  That mistake underlies the Ministers' approach.We are making an enormous decision in this legislation, one involving €54,000 million, €34,000 for every family.  One would expect that a cost benefit analysis would have been produced.  For a project that is less than one in 2,000 the size of this project, the Minister requires that a detailed cost benefit analysis must be prepared.  Where is the cost benefit analysis for this project?  Where is the White Paper?  If a defence policy initiative was proposed, a White Paper would be prepared outlining the pros and cons of it, the costs and the benefits and the reasons it is proposed.  Where is the White Paper on this proposal or any of the evaluation of the potential threats, risks and downsides of this as well as the potential benefits?  No such analysis has been provided.  All we have is 11 pages from a consultant who was hired by the Minister to provide a consultant's report.  We have not even seen his full report.The chief executive of the NTMA was kept out of the loop and therefore did not have an opportunity to evaluate the proposal.  The Central Bank has not offered any evaluation of the proposal.  It has said that it backs it without any evaluation.  Where is the hard-nosed evaluation that we would expect on even modest policy proposals showing the risks and the benefits and the analysis of the alternatives outlining their benefits and downsides?  Instead we have been treated to highly polemical and political attempts to discredit any alternative.  I have been exposed to it, as have other parties.  We have heard of fantasy banks.

Those who are defending this approach are largely conscripts and people who have vested interests in the system.  We need an objective debate on this.  Let us not forget that these are decisions where the interests of taxpayers and the interests of investors in banks are pitted against one another.  We have to make decisions that are based on proper understanding of those considerations.  Taking the approach that it is five minutes to midnight, that we must get something through and we have been waiting too long to act, is not the way to make this decision.  That would be a serious mistake.

It has not been focused on defending what has been put forward in the NAMA legislation, the overpaying that is proposed.  Why is it proposed to pay this long-term economic value?  All the debate has been about the Government trying to discredit alternatives.  Ministers need to have the confidence to put the analysis on the table.  There is an analysis and the Government is defending what it is doing; it is not analysing the impact and pros and cons of it.  We deserve to have such an analytical approach.One does not need to have a long memory in this House to remember a time when critics were brushed aside and told they should go and commit suicide——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Swedish Minister for Finance has said the Swedish model is entirely different from what the Minister proposes and it was based on tough hard-nosed approach to valuation, again something which the Minister rejects.  The IMF warned of the pitfalls of seeking to avoid nationalisation as a guiding principle of policy and so forcing the State to engage in this charade of evaluations — again that advice is not being heeded.  Patrick Honohan asked for a risk sharing mechanism that did not leave subordinated bonds of questionable value on the banks' balance sheets but instead forced the shareholders and the investors to take risk in NAMA.  That advice has not been heeded.  The IMF in its study said that state-run politically controlled asset recovery management systems are not successful.  Its advice is not being heeded.  Serious international players are offering their views but those views are not being embodied in the Bill before us.  That is something we cannot afford to ignore.  There are precedents for a different approach.  France embarked on the NAMA approach in the case of Crédit Lyonnais and 64% of the money was lost.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20639	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	374	It is important for the Minister to remember that international best practice on the way to deal with a banking crisis has evolved since he first hatched the NAMA approach.  At that stage, examples of recovery banks were not plentiful but now we have a very good example of a recovery bank that is even being reported on the national airwaves.  Bank resolutions that separated good from bad and made the professional investors pay for their bad decisions were not plentiful but we have now plenty of examples, including Northern Rock, Washington Mutual and Bradford & Bingley.  They are approaching the matter in the way Fine Gael has suggested, namely, separating what is important from what is not and protecting only what is important.  Prominent people such as Joe Stiglitz, Paul Romer and Willem Buiter are now supporting the type of resolution we are proposing, as is the big investor, George Soros.  Even the European Commission has said to the Government that it is wrong to say that bondholders cannot be forced to take a hit.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank it instructed the Government that it must not pay interest on the——

We believe that it is a mistake, but we are not going to be pigheaded.  If we lose the debate on the principle, we will persist in trying to get the best deal to protect the taxpayer in anything that goes ahead.  We want to see amendments.  We want to see a reversion to market value as the only basis on which taxpayers should be exposed.  We want to see a willingness to allow involuntary losses for the subordinated bondholders in these banks.  We want to see a satisfactory methodology of valuation that does not have Ministers at the heart of the appeal mechanism and no appeal system where it is proposed to pay too much for those assets.  We only want an appeal mechanism where the banks feel they got too little.We want to see the flawed risk sharing proposal adopted by the Minister changed to one that is robust and of the type advocated by the current Governor of the Central Bank.  We want to see the unacceptable recovery system, which is shrouded in secrecy, exposed, with full disclosure and the protection of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He should be in a position to objectively advise the House on how business is being conducted on our behalf.  We want to see proper Oireachtas oversight of this extraordinary animal the Minister is creating.We want to see robust mechanisms that will ensure liquidity flows.  In our view, that robust mechanism is the establishment of a national recovery bank.  We want to see that proposal embraced and included.  We want to see proper disclosure of all beneficiaries.  If the Government wins this principle, we need to remould this legislation from top to bottom.  It is a dangerous piece of legislation.  We have to move away from the principle.At this late stage I still appeal to the Minister to look at the alternative approaches that have been successful in other countries that have learned from the mistakes of NAMA, but the Minister is not adopting the lessons they have learnt.  We need to pull back from the NAMA approach and set as our priority the creation of a vehicle that gets credit to people and businesses that need it.  That has to be our top priority.  The trouble is that what we are seeing today is that after almost ten years of bad management of our public finances, the Bill is coming home to the doorstep of the taxpayer.  It is a bill for €54,000 million.  We should not lightly ask the taxpayer to pick up that bill when there are many better alternatives that would be more cost effective, fairer and better for our country.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	377	As I listened to the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I thought that the title of his paper ought to be "More Fairytales from Merrion Street" because the Minister is more "Minister ONAMA" than he is President Obama.  He treated us to quotes from President Obama but I remind him that, if he bothered to read the quotes and their context, they were made after President Obama became President and in the context of various large banking institutions such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac already having been taken into public ownership.  They were made after AIG, in effect, was taken into public ownership and, moreover, after a large swathe of Wall Street had been forced into mergers or been acquired and various large regional banks in the United States had either, in effect, been taken into public ownership or had been put into forced mergers and acquisitions.  When the Minister chooses to quote I wish that he would at least do so in context if we are to have a useful debate in this House.I wish to call a spade a spade.  The Minister read out a page of shame, namely, page 10, which gave a summary position of the book values of loans in the five banks.  I will take him through it again.  He said it is €24 billion in Allied Irish Banks, €28 billion in Anglo Irish Bank, €16 billion in Bank of Ireland, €1 billion in EBS and €8 billion in Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I wish to say to the Minister and his cronies among the bankers and developers and cronies of Fianna Fáil in the toxic triangle that Anglo Irish Bank, €28 billion, and Irish Nationwide Building Society, €8 billion, mean Fingers and Seanie to some of us as we read about their capers in the newspaper.

If there were others, I do not know who they are.  When Deputy Gilmore, the leader of the Labour Party, and I visited Merrion Street on the fateful night of the guarantee, I asked the Minister's officials only two questions, as did Deputy Gilmore.  We asked about those two banks and the effect they were having on the destruction of Ireland's reputation, especially in London and New York.

A whole series of other officials told us over and over again that the fundamentals of banking were sound.  In the previous two years I questioned the then Minister for Finance, now Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, about his decision to allow the Quinn family and others to gamble on contracts for difference to reduce and avoid having to pay even the modest stamp duty charged on the gambling that took place in Anglo Irish Bank.The Minister has a nerve to come in here and criticise other parties who have nothing like the track record of Fianna Fáil in terms of collaboration and collusion with some of those who have brought the Irish banking system to this low and who in doing so have put a debt on the head of every man, woman and child in this country of this generation and the next.

Any small or medium sized business person heading into a bank on the high street in any village or town in Ireland would be required to outline to that bank his or her expectations in terms of cash flowing in and out of their business and to set out the reasons the bank should provide them with a loan.

Where are the projected cashflows of NAMA over its seven to ten year life span?  A person wishing to purchase a house is required to bring to the bank manager details of his or her income and any other family income.  The bank manager then works out what he or she may or may not be able to borrow.  The Minister has come into this House and provided us with a series of summary figures — to which I will return later — which are grossly and grotesquely inadequate in terms of analysis and the respect he should have, if not the members of his party, for other Members of this House who have a mandate from their electorate to protect their interests.On the business plan, the analysis provided states that NAMA will pay €54 billion for the loans valued at €77 billion.  However, the Minister in his speech states that some of the loans have been evaluated as good loans and others as distress loans, which I do not understand even having spoken about this to some of the people working with the Minister.  The Minister also states in his speech that 40% of the loans are income bearing.  Is that correct?

Unless we get a consolidated list in regard to each broad group of loans and each developer we will not be able to evaluate the Minister's proposals.  What the Minister is asking us to do is to trust Fianna Fáil.  I do not trust Fianna Fáil and neither do most people on the street.  Why does the Minister, on this important day, a day with a price tag of €54 billion, treat us this way and ask us to trust Fianna Fáil?  This is not an episode of "The Simpsons"; it is the Dáil.  This is not a case of "Trust me I'm Irish", "Trust me I'm a Minister" or "Trust me I'm a TD".  This is a day for facts and figures that we can analyse.

Crystalising the losses for the bankers and borrowers — the developers — is one matter but where is the stimulus package?  The Minister made references at the end of his speech to worthy intentions.  The late nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, in respect of the €28 billion, was nationalisation of the worst kind, forced on the edge of a precipice when nothing else could be done.  The managing director of that bank came before us and told us it was a zombie bank.  I note that the Minister had nothing to say today in that regard.  I presume he would have had something to say had it, if we are in a nightmare movie, become undead.  The Minister never suggested it had become undead.Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society account for half of the €77 billion.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us how much of the €54 billion they account for?  I believe that there is a recognition among all parties in this House that there are different types of banks.  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank are main street banks in which people all over the country lodge their money and from which businesses expect to obtain credit and loans.  The folly of the Fianna Fáil approach to the guarantee is laid out for all to see in this document.We went to the wall this time last year.  The Minister stated at that time that we would be first-movers and that this would give us a tremendous advantage and sort of our liquidity problems but it never did, which is the reason we are here today.

He stated that it is hoped we will obtain a 10% to 15% premium in terms of long term economic value.  I received a letter the other day from a person who is falling behind in mortgage payments and is facing the prospect of house repossession.  Does the Minister know what happens when a bank repossesses a house?  People who work in the courts are concerned about the level of likely repossessions following passage of this legislation and Christmas.  When a bank repossesses a house, either through the courts or by agreement — many repossession cases do not reach the courts as many people simply hand over the keys to the house — it is empowered to sell that house for whatever price it can achieve.

Why do couples or businesses whose properties are being repossessed by the banks not receive a 10% to 15% premium in respect of their long-term economic value?  The Minister is proposing that developers——

There is a provision in various sections of the Bill for the possibility of charging interest, but our legal advisers, who have read the Bill carefully, have pointed out to us that there is no requirement to charge interest.  That is not written into the Bill; there is a capacity to do so but it is not a requirement.  I am sure the Minister is aware that developers have been walking around town happy in the knowledge that they will, under NAMA, have a holiday from interest payments.

Although the Minister has not clarified this, that rolled up interest is generally thought to have occurred in the last two or three years.

I will send the relevant sections of the Bill to the Minister.  I acknowledge that he wrote to me yesterday to indicate his intention to amend certain sections at the request of the Labour Party arising from legal advice we received on current crisis conditions.  I will send him the further legal advice to which I referred.  An undertaking by the Minister to amend the legislation in this respect would be in the public interest.Like one of the characters in Alice in Wonderland, this legislation requires the public to believe six impossible things before breakfast, all of which come down to a question of trust.  Do we trust Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Finance to head up the largest property firm on the planet?  Do we trust Fianna Fáil not to bail out the bankers and developer-borrowers?  Do we trust the Minister who claimed that the blanket guarantee he introduced for the financial institutions last September would be the cheapest bank rescue in the world?  Do we trust a Taoiseach who pleaded that Ireland’s economic fundamentals were sound when it was plain to see we were teetering on the brink of disaster?  Do we trust a Government that inflated a property bubble, ignored all advice to curtail property-based tax incentives and buried its head in the sand when the house of cards collapsed?  Do we trust the Green Party to put the country first or will it stay in office at all costs?The people are giving their verdict on these questions.  We are receiving mountains of e-mails and letters pleading with the Government to change course, because these correspondents know we are heading for disaster.  Fianna Fáil's rock-bottom standing in the polls is an indication of the public perception that its trust has been betrayed.  People see the modest prosperity they have built up through hard work in the last 15 to 20 years slipping away from them.  This is the painful reality for many.  People are angry and cannot fathom why the Minister for Finance wants to pour €44 billion into the very financial institutions that hold their mortgages, many of which are now in negative equity.  People no longer trust Fianna Fáil on the economy.During the summer I submitted a freedom of information request in respect of site acquisitions for schools in my constituency, which is also the Minister's.  In the last ten years, there has been one gigantic battle after another when 200, 500, 700 or 2,000 houses were built in various developments in Dublin West.  Substantial amounts of land were rezoned and it was only after this rezoning that school sites were acquired from the relevant developers.  I asked the Minister for Finance and his predecessors and the various Ministers for Education and Science in the last seven years to disclose what Fianna Fáil was paying to developers for school sites.  This summer, through a freedom of information request, I finally obtained the information I required.  It simply confirmed what I already knew, namely, that the Fianna Fáil way was to pay maxi prices for mini sites.  Many children in my constituency are now going to school in modern, recently built schools, but the playgrounds attached to many of these schools are merely small strips of land on either side of the main buildings.The developers involved, having bought the land at agricultural prices, then sold the rezoned land back to the Government for an average of at least €1 million per acre.  One of today's newspapers includes details of my freedom of information request.  This shows that one particular developer, Manor Park Homes — sometimes referred to as King of the Castle, for reasons of which we are all aware — received two tranches of some €5 million for a very small site to house two quite large primary schools.  The other developers, Menolly Homes and Park Developments, also received fistfuls and shed loads of money for school sites.The Taoiseach stated earlier on the Order of Business that nobody on this side of the House said anything about all of this.  In the last Dáil, the leader of the Labour Party brought forward a proposal to take this type of profiteering by developers at the public's expense out of the trade in building land.  The Taoiseach was incorrect when he held up his hands today and said that nobody on the Opposition benches did anything to address these issues.  My party did so and I am sure the Fine Gael Party can point to many measures it offered.  It is great fun for the Minister to slag off the Opposition as it gets a laugh from his back benches.  However, in the case of other countries which worked their way out of similar problems——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	421	When Mr. Bo Lundgren, whom the Government praised to the skies, visited Dublin some months ago he made three points.  He suggested one should not pay more than market value, which means we should not pay a 10% or 15% long-term economic value premium.  He then suggested that when a country finds itself in a grave position, as Sweden did at one time, the appropriate and best recourse was temporary nationalisation of important institutions.  The most important issue, however, was to have transparency so as to enable those in opposition to have a clear understanding of what was happening.On the nine o'clock news last night I watched bankers walk up Merrion Street and enter the Minister's office to receive a briefing in which they were told the real figures.  I felt a sense of rage when I saw the clip given the decision to refuse my requests to the Minister's office, which I made as an Opposition spokesperson yesterday and the day before, that I receive a briefing on an embargoed basis.  The Labour Party, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin have always honoured such embargoes.  We first received the information when the Minister addressed the House.  As we try to solve a problem that risks overwhelming the country, there is something wrong when the Minister chooses to call in the bankers, rather than Deputy Bruton or me, for a cosy fireside chat.  On the news last night we saw civil servants pulling down the window blind in the Minister's office when his face came into view.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	425	He looked like a happy camper.  What does he know that we do not know?What we heard today was not fantastic news for the poor taxpayers and citizens who the Minister will ask to take cuts in services and wages and further tax increases in the next few weeks.  Last night, I was reminded of a line from a song, "As he walked along the Bois de Boulogne with an independent air", except the location in this case was Merrion Street.  Does the Minister remember the old British music hall song about the man who broke the bank in Monte Carlo?  Yesterday, we had some of the men — if I may allow myself a less than worthy comment, all of them appeared to be men — who broke the bank strolling down Merrion Street looking much happier than the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, and others on the Government benches earlier this afternoon.  The Tánaiste does not look happy either.  What did the Minister tell the bankers that made them feel happy.  Will they get more bailouts?  Is there more money to come?This time last year, the Minister told us his bank guarantee was the best in the world and would work a treat.  It did not work and some weeks later he told us a little recapitalisation would be required.  Some time after that, he returned to tell us Anglo Irish Bank would have to be nationalised.  The Labour Party has offered the Minister a mechanism which would allow him to neatly do the job in hand.  In most European countries public ownership has been used in two ways.  First, it is used when private capital fails to invest and advance a project — electrification in the early years of this State is one example — and, second, it is used when private capital fails.  The banking industry has failed because it was caught in a bubble concentrated on property.The Minister referred to Japan.  The proposals he laid before us today indicate we are taking the Japanese as opposed to the Swedish route.  Newspaper reports have referred to a preferendum of Green Party members.  It seems party members inclined to the Swedish rather than Japanese model and we all understand the reason they did so.  We should recall that when faced with a banking crisis the Swedes temporarily nationalised those banks that were in a desperate position.  The Labour Party is perfectly happy to take a similar course of action here.My party has suggested a remedy to address the fear expressed by some that nationalised banks could be subject to political interference.  We propose the establishment of a banking commission to supervise the nationalised banks at arm's length from all politicians.  We also advocate that nationalised banks maintain the market disciplines of reporting on a quarterly basis, as they do when they have a stock exchange quotation.  Nationalisation in this context would be temporary and would be done for rescue purposes.  In light of the blanket guarantee, it would not be possible to proceed with some of the other alternatives that have been put forward.  The Minister also announced that the blanket guarantee will continue on a roll-over basis for five years.It is disingenuous of the Minister and his adviser, Dr. Alan Ahearne, to suggest NAMA will, to use Dr. Ahearne's phrase, wash its face.  The tables indicate that the bonds will be six to 12 month bonds which will be subject to an interest rate of 1.5%.  One does not have to be an economist to know that as other European countries emerge from recession and their economies stabilise, the European Central Bank will start to gradually increase interest rates.  For this reason, the 1.5% rate is only likely to last for between six and 18 months up to a maximum of two years.  I repeat my earlier call on the Minister to produce a business plan which sets out the flows of the bonds and their likely cost over their ten-year life.The subordinated bonds to which the Minister referred do not constitute risk sharing, as proposed by Professor Honohan.  His proposal was that bank shareholders be given a share in NAMA to ensure that the banks share the risk and to incentivise them to make the agency work as well as possible.  The Minister, however, is proposing to give subordinated debts or bonds to the banks as part of the overall package.  While I do not know how the market will price the bonds of €54 billion, they must, under ECB rules, be available for trading and sale on the open market.The Minister did not address what will happen to the bonds over their lifetime.  To place all of them on the open market at the same time would mean having a huge competitor flotation of Irish debt on the market at a time when the National Treasury Management Agency is trying to raise approximately €1.5  billion per month in bond auctions.  We want issues such as this spelled out to enable us to understand them.I hope the Minister does not believe he has some magical formula at his disposal that will not impose a cost on taxpayers because no one in the bond markets believes that is the case.  Once the bonds are issued, they will rank in traders' minds as Irish Government debt.  Does the Minister agree?

They will be called NAMA bonds.In his report to the Minister for Finance, the economist Dr. Peter Bacon said:Creditability is the overriding requirement of any proposal which is going to be successful in addressing banks' capital adequacy issues. This requires firstly that the operation be entirely transparent, that the resulting fiscal cost can be absorbed, and that the Government's prospective debt profile is a sustainable one. Another necessary feature is that NAMA should operate independently and without interference in the discharge of its functions.Our criticisms can be summarised as follows: NAMA's operations will not be transparent; the resulting fiscal costs cannot be absorbed; and the Government's prospective debt profile, in the way the Minister is doing this, is potentially not sustainable.In addition, NAMA will not operate independently and without interference in the discharge of its functions.  That is because in every line of the Bill, the Minister has the power to direct, commit and order.  While NAMA is finding a temporary home under the auspices of the NTMA, the reality is that NAMA is a cuckoo in the NTMA's nest because it is subject to the Minister's rule and diktat.  The Bill makes it clear that the NTMA will have no functions whatsoever in the governance, direction or management of NAMA.  It can, therefore, be argued that in its current form the Bill departs significantly from the proposals made by its original promoter, Dr. Bacon.  For that reason we ask the Government to reconsider the Bill, withdraw it and produce a new Bill that seeks to address the serious issues facing the country.I am not convinced that the Bill will do very much for the 450,000 people who have lost their jobs.  I am not sure how much the Bill will do to release credit into the economy.  Like the guarantee this time last year that was supposed to do the same thing and deal with liquidity, I am not convinced this Bill will do so.  Therefore, the Labour Party is asking the Minister to withdraw the Bill and bring forward amended legislation, or the Government could bring forward the Labour Party's proposal, which has been used around the world as the best possible remedy.I will finish by quoting from the report of the International Monetary Fund: "Insolvent institutions with insufficient cash flows should be closed, merged or temporarily placed in public ownership until private sector solutions can be developed."There have been numerous instances — for example, Japan, Sweden and the United States — where a period of public ownership has been used to cleanse balance sheets and pave the way to sales back to the private sector.  The Labour Party believes that is the best solution.  It is the only solution that is really possible in the context of the blanket guarantee the Government gave this time last year.  We recommend that to the House.

It is a hard time to be in Government, but I believe it is the right time for the Green Party to put its vision into action for it is a time of real change.  We will ensure that there is change in the strangely conservative and reckless banking system we have, conservative in that it was obsessed with property as the only area in which it saw enterprise as being possible, and reckless in the way that it let property lending go.  We will change that.  We are already starting to introduce change in the planning system, which no one else was able to do for 30 years, to end the blatant wrong whereby speculative profit could be earned from a public good, which was the rezoning that took place in that time.  We are changing that and can make further changes in our planning system learning from the mistakes that have been made.More than anything else we can change the spirit of enterprise in this country, to create a new model which is truly sustainable and gives our people not just an economic mantra for growth, but also an economic model which delivers cultural change.  It will also deliver a sustainable future that people can be proud of and buy into not just for economic benefit, but also because it is the right thing to do.It is a hard time in Government and hard decisions must be taken, which provide no political advantage.  They are easily picked up by the Opposition with trite soundbites that do not go into the complexity of the issues, which are hard to explain.  It is hard sometimes because the information one has cannot easily be shared when it comes to financial and commercial markets.  Many commentators are making comments without being apprised of the broad information one has within Government and which sets the environment within which decisions have to be made.We have been in Government for the past year when, on a series of occasions, action needed to be taken and decisions made.  That was not easy but we have made our contribution and will continue to do so for the national good.  It was not easy taking that decision on the guarantee, but I ask anyone else even with hindsight to put themselves in the Government's shoes when there was the real prospect of banks not having money to open the next day.  Would they have called the decision otherwise in seeing what they could do to take the country through this difficult time?  If they called it another way, what would they do in such circumstances?  While that guarantee was a difficult decision and has consequences — we said at the time that it was not without risks — it is one that may be part of a series of decisions that will help us to get out of these difficulties.Similarly, when it came to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, we looked into the corporate governance issue and found there were serious problems there.  We could not give that bank carte blanche to continue as if there was not a serious corporate governance problem.  We have to respect the separation between the political and criminal justice systems.  Much as we would like to see people being brought to book for that — being led away quickly in handcuffs, as they can do in America — we had to make those decisions in a responsible and correct way, putting in the necessary criminal investigations.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Yes it is, but in failing to do so the difficulty would be that the failure of one bank would lead to a failure in another.  It would lead us to the same problem we had at the start, which would have been a systemic failure in our banking system.  It was not easy to make the decision to put money into AIB and Bank of Ireland, but I believe it may be a decision from which we can ultimately profit.  We can turn the situation around and get our shares transferred to a price that is much higher than they were issued for back in February or March last year.Those were not easy decisions but they had to be made.  We have to make further decisions.  I recall attending the NTMA offices in February when the country was in crisis.  People did not realise the extent of the liquidity crisis.  It was a close call daily to have enough money to keep our banks open and to keep Government borrowing coming in.  NTMA officials said we had to raise a significant bond, which could be put into our banks to take out the bad assets and to give us time to get this to work.  Let us get the patient on to the operating table and then into intensive care before managing him or her over time.  I left that meeting with a sense of conviction and urgency.  We could not let the country fall and we had to do something significant to prevent it.I have been absolutely open to other suggestions about how to address this over the past six months.  The first time I was in the House following the February meeting I sat beside the Minister for Finance and I said to him that we would have to nationalise the banks.  I could not see any other way out because the scale of the problem was so great.  However, I have examined the issue over the past six months and while nothing is certain, no one should make categoric statements in the House about what is right or wrong.  We are dealing with markets comprising human beings, which react together in different ways, and it is not easy to judge how they will go.  All the evidence suggests that if we nationalise the banks, it may be difficult for the country to secure money.  The international markets might say there is too much risk in Ireland and they may hold money back or send it to Austria or Sweden or they could demand a higher price because of the risk all being rolled up into one.I cannot be absolutely certain what is the rate of risk but it is a potential cost and we could pay much higher interest rates that would quickly clock up a significant bill.  There is also a risk that if we try to run the entire banking system, we will not do a good job.  We can take certain actions in the political system but we would not run the banking system well.  As hard as Department of Finance officials have worked over the past year, they do not have the resources to run the system.  A proportion of the system must be in the market in order that supervision, independence, expertise and funding is ensured.  There are costs involved.  It is easy to think that it will all be sorted through nationalisation and the valuation process, but that would not reduce the cost of capitalisation that would have to be provided.  The losses on the loans will still occur and the State would have to pay for every loan.  NAMA will not take on loans worth less than €5 million, which are hassle to work out, but they would have to be taken on if the banking system was nationalised.I totally respect people's right to come up with alternatives but the complex implications and costs behind such decisions must be examined.  I have no objection to Deputy Bruton's good bank proposal but if one examines how it would work rationally, it is difficult to see how €2 billion in taxpayer's money could be turned into €30 billion or €40 billion to buy the good assets.

In addition, Fine Gael referred to the possibility of defaulting on subordinated debt.  I agree it would not be difficult for us to say to bondholders that they took a risk, which will lead to a loss.  However, if one examines what has happened in our banks, that loss has happened.  The bondholders have taken a hit of up to 75% in some cases.  I do not see where that magical, easy source of funding is in terms of tackling bondholders.The other alternative proposed is the default option, whereby we default on our bondholders.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The banks would, not us.  There is a difference.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	459	There is a difficulty with this in that even if the State defaulted on senior debt bondholders, it would have to go back to them the next day seeking money for the banking system or Exchequer borrowing and that could be more difficult to secure.  One cannot be certain but the Government has to take that risk into account.  It is easy on a hypothetical basis to say we should try this idea, but the Government has to take that risk on behalf of the people and there is also the potential risk of having to pay higher rates of interest.  Approximately 70% of bonds will mature before the expiration of the State guarantee next September.  If we take the default option, there is a risk of a flight of money out of our banks and we will be back to September 2008 again facing the difficulty of keeping money in our system to sustain lending.  This would not be done for the sake of the banking system.  If banks do not have money, they cannot open on Monday morning and cater for the housewife who wants to draw down money for her family or for the farmer who might want to buy seed.  This money would not be for the banks but to keep the system going.When one considers the various options, NAMA is complex but a number of its features stand to it.  First, it will be low cost.  The NTMA officials wondered last February whether the State could obtain ECB funding at a low rate because it would be hugely beneficial.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The ECB has stated it will provide the funding.  It is needed as part of a stimulus.  We are in a classic recession as we spiral downwards because of a lack of confidence and, in turn, a lack of spending, which has led to deflation.  All the economic analysis says a state must stimulate in those circumstances.  It is slightly counterintuitive to spend one's way out of debt and the problems associated with it, but it is the only way to do so, according to all the macro-economic analysis.This is our stimulus opportunity but it will not lead us back to the old ways.  We are at a fundamental changing point in capitalism, particularly in Ireland.  The politics of the past 50 or 60 years was about who owned the resources but this will change to how we sustain and protect such resources, which will lead to a new economy.  Keynes said in the middle of the last similar crisis in the 1930s that an economy must be stabilised before it can be reformed.  His analysis holds true today.  We are adopting a stimulus to get the patient out of the operating theatre and into intensive care for a number of years when we can make the reforms that are needed.  However, that must be done with a stimulus package.  That cannot be done while the economy continues to deflate and that is at the centre of the NAMA concept.It is important, having set out on that task and where assets are off the banks' sheets in order that they begin to lend more effectively, that there are protections for the taxpayer.  Last week, Deputy Burton said I was referring to an equal mix.  I clearly said that for any premium we pay above the current market value, the taxpayer must be protected through two key concepts.  First, we own a good chunk of the banking system and I have no problem with us taking a nationalised position in that sense in our banks and, therefore, we are on the other side of the deal for any such premium and we are protected.  Then there is the gap on risk sharing.  I read the letter written by Dr. Patrick Honohan which the Minister for Finance quoted earlier.  He is supportive of this approach and I do not know how Deputy Bruton can say he has not approved it.  Dr. Honohan said this was the correct risk sharing policy.  It is strong because the taxpayer is paid first and the bank second.  That concept is crucial in answering the taxpayer's question about how he can be sure he is not paying over the odds.  We want that concept stitched into the operation of NAMA.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	465	NAMA will be a small agency.  It is correct that the banks should be used.  Tens of thousands of ordinary, decent, capable and enterprising people work in our banking system and we should not throw that away and say that they do not have a role in this.  The Government can use their skills and credit management facilities to our purpose.  The banks' shareholders have taken a hit, losing approximately €40 billion on shares.  Trades unions, farmers and pensioners invested money in these shares.  Many people have lost a fortune and no one is protecting the banks and their shareholders.  Most of the money was lost, unfortunately, because of the fundamental mistakes made by the banks.  That does not mean we proceed on a vindictive basis with our banking system.  We will use those bank officials and the skills they have and turn them around to a new form of banking that suits our purpose.People, including those in our party as much as elsewhere, still have questions about how NAMA will work, which we will attempt to answer.  The crucial question concerns how we get a new banking system and how we can have a completely different culture where the obsession about selling property, car or simple loans turns into a banking system that is fit for the purpose we need now, namely, a clean, green energy, enterprise economy.  Our banks, as we recapitalise them, will have to set themselves to that task and make their profits there.  It may be less spectacular and speculative, but will probably be better over the long run, and it is what they have to do.  We have to get them lending and we have to guarantee and show how that will be done as we go through Second Stage and Committee Stage of this Bill.There must be further certainty around the valuation process, that is, where developers' equity exists or does not exist, which it will not in many cases because a deal might have been done in such a way that it was cross-securitised and the bank did not get the real value stitched down.  The figures today are estimates.  We are pursuing developers using the credit control facilities of the banks, and others, in a contract way that pursues developers to the nth degree, takes their houses if they cannot pay and gets the security back to the taxpayer.  That is something people need to know.  People need to know how they will be dealt with——
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	466	NAMA is the best idea the Government could come up with.

If they are not what we think they are, although a fair bit of analysis lies behind the figures given today, they will be adjusted.  It is the valuation on a loan-by-loan basis which will determine what happens.Another crucial point is that people need confidence that we are not going back to price rises in property.  The prospect of spending 25 or 30 years paying off a mortgage was a killer for young people in this country.  I got my own mortgage some ten years ago and when they showed me the figures I could not believe how much I would pay off in the end compared to how much I got in the first place.  We do not need property markets going up all the time for us to make money.  For too long we were obsessed with property and we need to get away from it.  The figures set out today include ten years estimating a less than 10% increase in property.  Any difference between the interest rate one is paying and inflation will cover that.  We are not trying to get the economy kicking again in terms of property prices.  Those days are gone.In terms of the default option, there is a view out there that says "Let the market do it".  I heard Deputy Richard Bruton say it today.  Should the Government be setting up an asset management agency at all?  Are we good or bad at that?  I had some thoughts over the past few days when I read articles expounding the theory that the market knows best.  I disagree.  Our banking system, developers and market were lousy at asset management development.  I heard Deputy Rabbitte laughing earlier and saying "Here is the Green Party bit of the Bill where we will put in special schools and parks".  I am proud of that new part of the Bill.  I am proud of getting planning that puts the school in at the same time as the houses and which does not pay over the odds.I am proud of being in the Green Party in these difficult times.  Deputy Bruton said he did not have faith in our DNA to get the planning right and act like the Swedes do.  We are comfortable with our ability to do that.  We can do it in a way that helps this country out and have a vision as to how one sticks to proper planning.

I believe we can.  We have grown up as a country in 70 or 80 years.  We got it wrong in the past ten or 20 years.  We got cheap, easy money after we had been poor for 800 years.  We blew it, but we are still a strong and capable country that has grown tremendously in the past 80 years.  If it is, as Deputy Burton said, a personal trust, I trust the people of this country, in these very difficult and challenging times, to be able to turn things around and for us to be able to get this to work.  That is why I support this Bill and the Minister for Finance today.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	478	Today was supposed to be the Holy Grail but instead we got a document, the bulk of which is already in the public domain.  I find it amazing that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, referred to the fact that he is happy.  In the presentation made by the Minister for Finance today there is no breakdown between the institutions themselves and how much capital will be required by the banks in total.  I have no doubt that was not given because we would have some idea of the individual banks.  There is no detail about what date will be used to determine the market valuation.  I note the report itself, in terms of valuation, states that land will be valued at its long-term useful economic value.How can one have a situation where land which has reduced in value by up to 70% will suddenly be assessed in terms of its long-term economic value?  All other assets will be valued at market value.  I note page 11 of the document refers to property yields which, I have no doubt, the Government has used for the valuation of the market value of investment assets.  It is effectively stated that the property market has bottomed out and the prime yield is at 7.25% compared to 5.56% for a long term average.  It has not bottomed out.We are being told by various businesses that the amount of rent being paid is going down and that the value of commercial property is falling and will continue to fall.  The Government is basing the figures on the assumption that the market has bottomed out and prices will now increase.  That will not happen.  Prices will continue to fall.I am sorry the Green Party Ministers have left the Chamber.  The Minister has too much control in terms of the valuation process.  Section 77 states that the Minister for Finance can effectively use adjusting factors and take them into account.  I would be very interested to see what analysis the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, would provide in terms of the section that states the Minister for Finance, in looking at the adjusting factors, must examine the analysis presented by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the extent to which existing land zoning and planning permission is granted and enforce or exceed projected growth requirements.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government states that currently land is zoned for residential developed for the building of approximately 1 million units.  At 50,000 units a year that is 20 years' supply.  It does not add up.  The Green Party is bluffing.  Its rank and file members feel the same way.  There is a 30% haircut.  We are not being given a breakdown in terms of the individual banks because if one looks at the situation, the largest amount of loans being taken over are those of Anglo Irish Bank, some €28 billion which makes up 36%.Are the discounts being skewed towards Anglo Irish Bank so the other banks take less of a write down, and once the process begins will the Government commence the winding-down of Anglo Irish Bank, which is currently being wound down anyway?  Some €28 billion of taxpayers' money is going into Anglo Irish Bank, which has not lent a red cent since it was nationalised.  The Government wants to put €28 billion into that bank.I will ask the Minister to give us a breakdown of the write-downs for all the banks — AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  He also needs to tell us how much he expects, based on the write-downs, to be required to put into the individual banks.  The Minister's claim that there will be an average loan-to-value ratio of 77% does not stand up.  The development loans of some of the banks were doubled, in effect, between 2005 and 2006.  Once again, that does not add up.  The assumptions on which the Minister for Finance has based his projections do not add up.  I refer to rental yields, for example.  He believes rental yields will fall as property prices rise, but I do not think property prices will rise in the short term.I would like to speak about the whole issue of risk sharing.  Reference was made to Professor Honohan, whose model is based, in effect, on buying assets at their current market value and giving a shareholding to the shareholders in the bank for any upside.  The Minister has said that 5% of the total amount will be in the form of subordinated debt.  I would like to know about the risk that will be put on the balance sheet of the bank.  The legislation says that the banks will not be repaid unless a profit is made.  I expect the banks to continue to provide capital.  They will have to make some provision if there is a default in respect of the subordinated loans that would stop lending from taking place.  I will ask the Minister to tell us what rate of interest will be paid on the subordinated debts.  Has agreement been reached to provide for the subordinated debts to be given as security to the European Central Bank when funding is being sought?  If that is the case, the repayment of the debt will be guaranteed and, therefore, any question of any form of risk-sharing does not arise.  These extremely important issues need to be clarified.I would like to comment on the references to credit flowing to small business in the Minister's speech and the document he provided to us.  He referred to what was done during the previous recapitalisation scheme and to the Mazars report.  There is nothing in the NAMA legislation to compel the banks to lend.  I suggest that the banks will choose to hold onto their money, for example, by way of Government bonds on their balance sheets or by way of deposits.  They need to increase their deposit-to-loan ratios, which are low by international standards.  What measures will the Minister for Finance introduce to ensure that rather than merely finding their way into the banks, funds are loaned to small businesses?  We are all looking for a financial system that works.  The problem with the system being proposed by the Government is that the only person to take a downside risk will be the taxpayer.  From the point of view of the banks, it is a win-win proposal.  It gives no guarantee that funds will flow to small business.  It is clear that assets are being over-valued.  That is why I want the Minister to give the House an indication of the write-downs, in terms of percentage and value, that apply to each bank.  I want a breakdown of the €23 billion figure — the haircut of €77 billion, less €54 billion — across the banks.  That will clearly show what is going on in the respective banks.  I want to know the precise amount the Minister will be required to invest in the individual banks.  I want to know if Anglo Irish Bank will be purely in a wind-down situation.Deputy Fleming has suggested that the Minister should not take part in any appeals mechanism when there is a dispute about valuations.  I suggest it is critical that the Minister should have no involvement in the valuation process, from start to finish.  It is clear that section 77 of the Bill provides for what can be called the Lenihan law of valuations.  The Minister is assumed to have a secret ingredient that enables him to value assets.  That leaves the process open to corruption, in the form of the massaging of the amount that needs to be paid to particular developers, or in respect of particular assets.  Fine Gael's policy would minimise the cost to the taxpayer by sharing the risk with the bondholders.  Its effect would be to ensure that funds flow to small businesses through the proposed national recovery bank.  I commend that policy to the House.

We are talking about the future of the country.  I refer in particular to the next generation of this country's citizens.  The Government is offering the people of this country despair, rather than the hope they need from this debate.  The Government that has been in power for 18 of the past 20 years needs to be changed so that the over 400,000 people who are unemployed can find jobs.  We need a competent Government, rather than the incompetence we have faced over many years in this House.  As we know from the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Government has wasted a great deal of money on PPARS and electronic voting, for example.  The people really want something different, but they are not getting it from the Government and there is no hope of it today.  We are getting more of the same, despite the presence of the Green Party in the current coalition.The Taoiseach said earlier this year that the young people of this country will be the first generation to be worse off than our generation.  That is an appalling vista.  It was an appalling statement for the Taoiseach to make, although it was not picked up on at the time.  Change and new thinking are represented by Deputies Bruton and Kenny and the other members of my party, rather than those on the other side of the House.  We want radical changes in the way this House does its business, including the budgetary process.  We want the Freedom of Information Acts to be amended in the interests of increased accountability and transparency.  We want good government, but we will not get it from the Members on the other side.I would like to reflect on what the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said on behalf of the Green Party.  I respect him and his colleagues as people.  They have been my friends in the past.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, spoke a couple of years ago about what it was like for this country to be on Planet Bertie.  He has since accepted the post of this Government's high priest, or Dalai NAMA, who offers absolution for the sins of builders and bankers at the altar of Fianna Fáil.  The Green Party is in government with the most corrupt party in the history of the State.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, mentioned that legislation is not in place to bring people away in chains.  I do not take any personal pleasure from reminding him that a former Minister, who sat on the Fianna Fáil side of the House, was led away in chains on foot of his involvement in planning corruption.  Year after year, the tribunals expose the corruption that was at the heart of Dublin County Council.  I refer to Frank Dunlop and others who engaged in the rezoning of land.I cannot understand why the Green Party continues to act as the bondsman who bails Fianna Fáil out.  Fianna Fáil's brass band consists of Green Party Deputies and Senators.  They are playing footsie with a Government they campaigned against.  They said they would not go into government with Fianna Fáil.  I cannot understand why they do not want to bring about a change that would offer the hope and the jobs this country so badly needs.  This failed and discredited Government has shown a wanton disregard for the ordinary people of this country.  It has lined and will continue to line the pockets of the rich, while scourging the poor and ordinary people of Ireland.  Over 440,000 people in this country do not have a job.  Over 200,000 people have lost their jobs over the past year not because of the international recession, but because of a lack of regulation, the structural deficit and what has happened in the banks.  That is because of a lack of regulation, the structural deficit and what has occurred in the banks.One honourable banker, Eugene McErlean, stood up to the system some years ago by saying that his bank was corrupt and overcharging customers.  However, his complaints to the Financial Regulator went unheeded.  He has been without a job for the past seven or eight years because he dared to tell the truth and expose a scandal at the heart of our banking system.  If he applies for a job with the Financial Regulator, will he even get an interview?  Not on one's life.  He has been blacklisted by the system.  He was the one man in the banking system who stood up to tell the truth.  He represents honour, integrity and decency and if we had more bankers like him, we could have confidence in our banks.  Until the entire rotten system changes so that people such as Mr. McErlean are involved, the Green Party will only be speaking rubbish.He stated in an article published this week that it was not the excesses in subprime lending that wiped out our economy, but a different disease.  Little did we realise that the banking patients were already showing signs of terminal illness caused by that age old killer, over lending to the property sector.  This was the killer which brought banks to their knees throughout economic history and which spawned expensive and sophisticated risk management machinery so that the banks remained inoculated and vigilant, or so we thought.  However, the absence of enforcement was at the heart of the regulatory failure.  In Ireland, it was not an issue of a rules versus principles based system but a failure to enforce any rules or principles at all.  Earlier this year at an Oireachtas committee meeting, Senator Ross managed to extract an admission from the Financial Regulator that prior to 2008 no enforcement action had been taken against any major financial institution.  We now know there was no shortage of issues upon which the regulator could have acted to enforce discipline.  Indeed, a recent report published by the consumer panel of the Financial Regulator noted that there should be no distinction between principle and rules.  Both are required in any absence of governance because principles in the absence of the enforcement of rules are ineffective.The whole house has come tumbling down because the Government did not regulate the banks.  Fianna Fáil in particular was so close to the builders and bankers that it brought us to this ruinous state.  It is like a pyramid scheme in that the builders who got in early made their bucks while everybody else pays.  We are all suffering because of poor governance and a lack of regulation.  How many of the 50 top builders involved in NAMA appeared before the Mahon tribunal?  If any are condemned, will we bail them out?  Corruption lies at the heart of this matter and we need a new way of doing business if we are to offer hope instead of despair and jobs instead of jobseeker's allowance.A change of Government is needed if these changes are to take place.  The Green Party has the option of walking away from Fianna Fáil and causing an election.  We need a mandate for the future and people are crying out for change, but they will not get it if this Government continues to stick together.  At the margins of our constituencies, people are losing their jobs and their hope because the Government has no credibility.  In the name of God, it is time for the Government to go.  We must have a general election so that the people can decide.  They will choose to get rid of Fianna Fáil and, if Green Party Members want to go down with the ship, let them.  This side of the House believes it offers a credible alternative and new hope.Fine Gael has created a constructive stimulus package, which Deputy Coveney has outlined for the Government.  We must offer hope and change.  The new green economy which we propose will create over 100,000 jobs given a Government with the determination, conviction and idealism to make the necessary changes.  Clearly, however, the Government lacks these attributes.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this critical debate on the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency, which has caused the early return of the Dáil.  The NAMA initiative must be set against a background of ongoing pressure on the public finances and continued uncertainty in the financial sector.  The Government will continue to take decisive and coherent action to resolve the serious budget deficit, address the unprecedented slowdown in the economy and restore stability to the financial system.  These issues need to be resolved in parallel with managing the public finances and cleansing and repairing our banking system.From the outset, the Minister for Finance has made it clear that he is keen to engage in a proper debate on NAMA so that the Government can deal with the issues involved as comprehensively as possible.  This is why he published draft legislation at the end of July.  Since then he has listened to a range of constructive suggestions from various parties and the Bill as initiated today reflects this process.  Just over two weeks ago, as part of his consultative approach, he engaged in detailed discussions with the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  He has also stressed that he will continue to listen to constructive comments and suggestions until the enactment of the Bill.  However, action is required sooner rather than later if we are to remove the impediments to the ability of financial institutions to lend to the wider economy.  The Government's record since the start of the crisis reveals a series of necessary actions taken to stabilise the financial system, protect depositors and safeguard taxpayers' interests.  These measures include the guarantee of certain bank liabilities, the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, thereby allowing banks to raise the funds needed to support their operations and ensuring that citizens and businesses can conduct their daily transactions.  In return for this measured support, the taxpayer has received payment from the banks.  The eventual payment from the banks on foot of the guarantee scheme will be approximately €1 billion and the preference share investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland will yield approximately €560 million per annum at an 8% coupon.  It should not be forgotten that remuneration for senior executives and directors has been reformed and banks have had to sign up to new rules regarding their dealings with business and residential customers.Much remains to be done, however.  Anxiety about the impact of risky land and development loans on our banking system continues to create funding difficulties for the banks.  This, in turn, restricts the flow of credit as banks focus their resources on these troubled loans.  Each euro that a bank lends to a customer must be drawn from deposits or borrowed by the bank from another source.  This, in turn, restricts the flow of credit as banks focus their resources on these troubled loans.  Each euro that a bank lends to a customer must be drawn from deposits or borrowed by the bank from another source.  Irish banks have relied heavily on foreign financial institutions for funding.  However, the uncertainties surrounding the scale of losses on banks' balance sheets have made this liquidity more difficult and costly to attract.  Furthermore, as long as the banks remain unsure about the losses that may eventually result from these risky loans and nervous about the adequacy of their capital, they will hesitate to provide the credit which is vital to our economic recovery.  Everyone is agreed that a resolution is urgently required because otherwise the economy will remain shackled as it awaits a banking system capable of providing credit to viable businesses and households.  The Government view is that the asset management agency approach is the best option for addressing this issue and this view has gradually been gaining public support.Of course a significant portion of the debate, both today and over the past several weeks, has centred on the risk involved in setting up NAMA and as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, any option for solving the banks' problems involves risk.  Around the world it has become clear that the risk is one that the private sector is unwilling to take.  It is for that very reason that governments all around the world have been forced to provide various supports to their financial sectors.Of course there is continually an attempt to make out that this is just a national problem instead of a global problem.  Confidence in banks worldwide was shaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers last autumn and we and other countries are coping as best we can with the fall-out.  Obviously, there are particularly national circumstances which, maybe, differentiate the fall-out, but we are dealing with a global problem and it is misleading the public to suggest that this is something that only this country is facing.More specific to today's debate, Ireland is not the only country working on a policy solution to deal with the uncertainties surrounding certain asset classes.  The US, Germany, the UK, France and others have all put forward schemes tailored to the specific problems faced in each country to deal with impaired assets.The Government's position is that the problems associated with lending for land and development are best addressed by transferring these assets to an asset management agency and it was only after a detailed assessment of the various options for dealing with these risky assets and acting on the recommendations of expert advice that the Government decided that this was the best approach.In terms of the reaction to the Government's approach, I should like to mention the subject of interest rates.  The interest rate that Ireland pays on its debt is significantly determined by relevant Government policies and it is vital to maintain the appropriate fiscal policies and financial market policies if we are to enjoy the confidence and support of the international markets.  Since the Minister for Finance announced in April last the intention to establish a national asset management agency bond spreads above the German benchmark for Irish sovereign debt have halved from almost 3% over ten-year German bonds to now just 1.5%, and clearly the proposal has the support of the international markets.  I might also add that the NAMA proposal has been widely supported by bodies such as the IMF and the ECB.I emphasise in passing what the Minister has already referred to in his speech, the importance of passing the Lisbon treaty referendum from the point of view of maintaining that improvement in confidence.  Any uncertainty about Ireland's future position or influence in the EU would be costly.  We cannot afford to be in denial, as some are, about the economic importance of the vote on the Lisbon treaty.  We in this small country cannot afford the indulgence of aligning ourselves with British opposition eurosceptic attitudes — of course Britain has already ratified the Lisbon treaty.  Membership of the European Union and the unprecedented opportunities it has given to us is the most tangible fruit and demonstration of Ireland's independence, and reinforces and enhances it rather than diminishes it.As mentioned, there is a risk attached to the NAMA proposal as there would be for any other proposal designed to alleviate the problems with the banks' balance sheets but as the Minister for Finance pointed out earlier, there is another significant risk of which we cannot allow ourselves to lose sight.  This is the risk of damage to our economy inflicted by a clogged-up banking system which if not addressed sooner rather than later may inflict pain on the taxpayer through the scourge of even more increased unemployment for many years to come.  We must act decisively and promptly if we wish to position ourselves to take advantage of the upturn that will emerge in the global economy over the next few years.  Indeed, it seems that such a recovery already may be emerging.  There are some tentative signs that growth is returning internationally and over the next few months the durability of this will become clearer.While the openness of the Irish economy means that Ireland has been badly affected by the global downturn there are grounds for optimism that we can take advantage of any upturn.  The economy is flexible, evidenced by the fact that prices and wages are adjusting rapidly.  On a harmonised basis, consumer prices in August fell by 2.4%, the fastest rate of decrease in the euro area.  In the public sector de facto wage cuts averaging approximately 7.5% have been implemented this year while there is survey-based evidence as well as some limited hard data to suggest that private sector wages are also adjusting downwards.  These rapid wage and price adjustments are helping to begin the restoration of our competitiveness, which is essential if we are to benefit from the global recovery when it emerges.Many in this House have spoken of the pain being experienced by people hard hit by the recession but it is also fair to comment on the practical "can do" attitudes of many people faced with this crisis.  There is a willingness to adjust and to accept, particularly, that those in jobs and with reasonable incomes need to adjust and make sacrifices, and that the quicker we do so the quicker we will recover.  I pay tribute to that constructive public attitude.Domestically, the Government has moved rapidly to maintain the public finances on a sustainable path.  Notwithstanding the pressures on the public finances the Government is maintaining investment in physical and human capital at high levels.  Infrastructural investment as a proportion of national income will remain high by international standards helping to improve efficiency and reduce costs.  Furthermore, the Government will continue to invest heavily in education at all levels, especially at third and fourth level in recognition of the importance of human capital in the global economy.  The NAMA initiative will complement and support these other Government policies in ensuring that we are best placed to take advantage of the upswing.There has been much public debate around the idea that shareholders and bondholders should bear a greater proportion of the banks' losses.  With regard to shareholders, the Minister for Finance has made clear that if after the introduction of NAMA the banks require an injection of capital from the public purse then this capital will be in the form of an equity stake.  This will dilute the current ownership of shareholders, who have already lost considerable sums and are likely to lose more if their shares are diluted further.  With regard to bondholders, a large amount of subordinated debt has been bought back by the banks in recent months at a significant discount.  This has resulted in bondholders taking substantial losses relative to the face value of their bonds.The idea that all bondholders are natural risk takers aiming at high reward in return for high risk is erroneous.  Senior bondholders are not high-risk takers.  They are usually long-term providers of debt such as pension funds and insurance companies.  They are also the type of investors who buy Government debt and who kept our economy funded.The Minister has already made clear that the Government does not believe that a culture of default or potential default would serve the best interests of the taxpayer.  The ability to roll over funding continuously depends on a fundamental belief on the part of the investor in the viability of the investment and the stability of the institution concerned.  The history of the past few centuries in Europe as well as contemporary experience further afield shows the fatal consequences of what might amount to debt repudiation.  It is a risk-free suggestion for those not currently in positions of responsibility to advocate such populist solutions.  The Government, in contrast, would be responsible for the consequences of such decisions.The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have repeatedly made clear the Government's firm belief that as far as possible the banking sector should have a market presence and operate within market disciplines and constrains.  Despite this many cling to the illusion being promulgated that nationalisation will address all of the problems facing our banks.  This is just not so.  The impaired assets still would have to be dealt with and the shareholders in AIB and Bank of Ireland would have to be compensated — all of this before the State puts additional capital in to resolve the capital deficiencies from dealing with impaired assets.Nationalisation could also impact negatively on financial institutions' own funding.  Anglo Irish Bank provides an example of the funding challenges presented by nationalisation where the Government was required to inject almost €4 billion in capital following serious losses.  The concentration risk in association with the policy of nationalisation could force investors to withdraw funds from certain nationalised banks on the grounds that they were effectively owned by the same owner.  No other major country is currently adopting a policy of wholesale bank nationalisation.  Therefore, if Ireland was uniquely to pursue that option it could from an international perspective be very damaging to Ireland's reputation and attractiveness to international investors.  This is a social market economy, not a socialist economy.  We should not be sending signals that we are shifting to a different economic system.  I understand, having been around politically for a long time——

My belief is an alternative Government would take over and say, in effect, "We can operate this system because we can be trusted, but of course Fianna Fáil could not be."The Minister pointed out that it was likely there would be institutions in need of additional capital in order that they could absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and to maintain a capital position in compliance with regulatory requirements.  However, he made it clear that the Government would expect such an institution to explore all available options for raising such capital.  This is consistent with the Government's stated policy preference that private market solutions be found and implemented and if this does not prove successful, it is committed to providing such institutions with the necessary level of capital to continue to meet their capital requirements.  Its view is that this is a more focused and effective policy than blanket nationalisation.

Such is not the case.  NAMA is only in place because a functioning banking system is vital to our economic future.  It is not a bailout for anyone.  A developer whose bank loan is purchased by NAMA will have to repay NAMA just as he or she would have had to repay the bank.  The terms and conditions of such a developer's business relationships with NAMA entities will not change as a result of the agency purchasing loans from his or her bank.  In fact, since NAMA will acquire the loans at a significant discount from the banks' book value, it will be in a position to be more aggressive with borrowers if it deems this necessary.  The draft legislation also contains a number of provisions which will assist it in its dealings with developers and ensure every last cent due to the taxpayer is pursued vigorously.The Government's proposal for a national asset management agency is a prerequisite for economic recovery and the regeneration of employment.  It will cleanse the balance sheets of Irish banks, thereby allowing them to focus their resources on discharging their essential role in the economy, the provision of credit.  In tandem with other policy initiatives the Government is taking with regard to restoring competitiveness and bringing order to the public finances, it will ensure we will be best placed to take the earliest possible advantage of the economic upswing around the globe and in our export markets.  The legislation introduced by the Minister reflects detailed consideration of how NAMA will need to operate in order to protect the State's investment and generate a return for the taxpayer.  This is no gamble, but a very carefully worked out proposal.  The approval of NAMA by this House is the key to the future of this country, which is why I encourage all parties and Members to support it.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The setting up of a national asset management agency to purchase loans from banks with a book value of €77 billion, secured on property and land currently worth a fraction of that sum, at the supposed discounted price of €54 billion based on an estimated future potential value, is the greatest financial gamble any government has taken on behalf of its people.  The motivation of the Government in bringing forward this legislation is genuine, which is to create a functioning system from the current insolvent banking mess where liquidity cannot be provided for consumers, families or businesses due to the burden of toxic loans the banks have brought on themselves.While this is, undoubtedly, a public sponsored bailout for Irish banks, I do not buy into the conspiracy theory that it is a bailout for the wealthy development friends of Fianna Fáil.  Developers and speculators who have borrowed irresponsibly from careless and morally corrupt banks will continue to owe that debt, whether under NAMA or existing banks.  I hope that, whatever shape NAMA takes if the legislation is passed, it will fearlessly pursue those responsible for property debt to minimise losses to the public.  However, a growing number of others and I believe the NAMA approach is fundamentally misguided, irresponsible and blatantly unfair to the public which is to be burdened with the consequences of the enormous debt should NAMA fail to realise the value paid for its loan book.The Government's gamble with taxpayers' money is based on such uncertainty that to support NAMA is like committing other people's money to a bet one cannot afford to lose.  It is the uncertainty around NAMA that makes the proposal so unacceptable.  Predictions as to whether NAMA will make a profit or loss in decades to come amount to guesstimates at best.  The truth is nobody knows or can predict with any certainty how the Irish property market will perform in the next five to ten years.  All we know is that we have no functioning property market and there is no reason to believe the position will change any time soon.  The Government is committing tens of millions of public resources, albeit in the form of cheap bonds, on the basis of a future hope value for property, without any credible evidence in respect of future property values.The financing of NAMA on top of the financing requirements of the Government between now and 2010 will massively increase Ireland's national debt levels.  Predictions that our debt levels will reach 110% of GDP within a year are now accepted.  The reduction of the national debt in the last ten years of prosperity has been wiped out in 18 months.  As Dermot Desmond said today, public sector spending is already out of control.  We do not need to bloat it further with a €54 billion spend on NAMA.  However, the Government is right about one thing.  We must find soon a solution to the banking crisis, as the economy is being strangled by lack of credit and cash.I want to pose five key questions to assess whether NAMA is the best way to solve the banking crisis.  Is it the lowest cost option and the most effective way to minimise losses?  Does it minimise the risk to the taxpayer?  Are investors and risk takers in banks taking their fair share of the losses?  Will NAMA solve our credit and liquidity crisis?  Is the NAMA plan the only show in town?  The answer to each of these questions is an emphatic no and the basis for the need to oppose this expensive and flawed proposal.To take the first question as regards whether NAMA is the lowest cost option, last November the IMF finalised a study of banking and property crises in seven countries where this type of approach had been adopted.  It stated clearly that government owned asset management companies appeared largely ineffective in resolving the issue of distressed assets, mainly due to political and legal constraints.  In other words, the IMF warns that NAMA-type solutions end up costing the taxpayer a fortune because politically directed state agencies are much less skilled and aggressive than private banks in recovering loans from wealthy powerful interests.  The Fine Gael proposal is an alternative to NAMA and would force banks to confront their mistakes in order that they effectively would set up their own asset management and debt recovery agencies.  Our view is being adopted by more and more countries because it makes sense and only turns to the taxpayer for bailout funds as a last resort after forcing banks and their investors to carry risk and responsibility first.Does it minimise risk to the taxpayer?  Absolutely not.  At a time when we will be asking people to pay more taxes, take cuts in their pay and accept cuts in public services because our public finances are regarded as a basket case owing to Government incompetence, we are exposing the State to unnecessary and enormous financial risk.  The Minister tells us that if NAMA makes a loss, banks will need to pay a levy to meet that loss.  What a joke.  If banks are charged a levy how will they finance that levy if not by charging consumers for their banking services?  Either way the public will pay for the losses incurred.Are the investors and bondholders taking their fair share of risk?  Absolutely not.  Surely a principle should be set at the outset of this discussion that the first losers of crystallising losses in banks due to appalling decision making and lending should be the speculators and bondholders in the banks concerned.  When professional investors make an investment involving risk and potential return that goes badly wrong, they expect losses — that is capitalism.  What is happening here is a transfer of risk and ultimately a large amount of funds from the taxpayer to bondholders and investors, which is a scandal.Will this plan put liquidity back into the economy?  This is the key question.  What are we trying to achieve here?  Are we trying to save banks to keep the institutions alive or is it about ensuring a functioning responsible banking system to provide credit and cash to an economy in crisis?  The Irish economy will continue to stay on its knees.  Businesses will continue to suffer and unemployment will continue to rise if we cannot get liquidity into the veins of the Irish economy.  Irish recovery is not about property values — that is a consequence.  It is about liquidity and credit availability.  If people cannot borrow they cannot spend and businesses cannot grow.  I cannot see how NAMA will result in banks lending to businesses, families and consumers.  The funding given to banks through bonds will not be funnelled into lending to consumers.  It will be used to repay debts owed by banks to other lending institutions.  NAMA will not reduce the banks' loan to deposit ratios.  It will simply replace one form of non-deposit funding, interbank loans, with another, ECB funding.  NAMA alone fails to solve the most crucial problems of liquidity and making funds and credit available to people and their businesses.  Fine Gael wants to inject finance directly into the economy through a new State-owned recovery wholesale bank.  This has been achieved in France as Deputy Bruton and other Fine Gael spokespeople pointed out.Is NAMA the only show in town?  No it is not.  Fianna Fáil Ministers and, more recently, Green Party representatives have tried to create the myth that we have no option but to accept NAMA.  They claim it has been accepted by the markets at this stage and we must proceed.  They claim that if we do not proceed we will introduce uncertainty and that the most important issue now is certainty.  I do not accept that.  This is wrong.  Other countries are debating how to resolve banking crises as we speak.  We have the benefit of other solutions being implemented elsewhere.  Most governments are now moving away from the NAMA approach.  Fine Gael's approach of a good bank-bad bank solution has been outlined repeatedly.  This is an approach, variants of which have been adopted to fix banks in other countries.  The examples have already been given of Northern Rock, Washington Mutual, and Bradford and Bingley.To those outside this House who are taking an interest in this debate, I say that NAMA is flawed and there are alternatives despite the spin people will hear from the Government.  Ireland is in crisis and banking is at the centre of that crisis.  We need big thinking from Government, but it has got it wrong here and should be sent back to think again.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Sometime during the summer when the real depth and extent of what was being planned began to dawn, the Government must have been taken aback at the depth and bitterness of the opposition to NAMA.  Its representatives tried to explain it away as oppositional politics or a failure to understand what was being proposed.  However, it is neither.  People understood and understand very well what is being proposed.  They know what has happened.  They understand that our banks are effectively bankrupt.  They know that thanks to their reckless lending into a property bubble their balance sheets are absolute rubbish.  They know their assets are propped up by the ECB to the tune of €130 billion.  On the liability side, their deposits and bonds are guaranteed by the Government on behalf of the taxpayer.  They also know these artificial life supports cannot be left switched on indefinitely.  They also know that if either of these supports, on the asset or liability side, is removed then the entire shaky edifice will come tumbling down, and bring down with it the aspirations of this generation and probably the next one also.They also know that however galling it may be to them we must rescue the banks, they cannot be allowed to collapse.  They know we need to keep credit flowing in the economy and that we need a modern functioning financial system.  They also know that the solution, whatever it may be, will be risky and expensive.  While the figure changes daily, we have at least €90 billion in outstanding property loans.  We have not paid too much attention to outstanding personal debt, but I hear from the banks that personal bad debts are at least as high as commercial bad debts.  If the economy is to recover, it will not be from a consumer boom.  It would make me wonder just how clean bank balance sheets will be, even after we have given them these billions of euro.  The cost of cleaning up the bank loan books, while still unknowable, is certainly huge.The public accept that no matter what course of action is taken to rescue the banks, there will be risks attached.  There are risks with our solution, the Labour Party solution and the NAMA proposal.  We cannot remove risk but we can and must ensure the risk is shared.  The public do not understand why they must take all the risk of the bad loans while the banks which made those loans and the investors who funded them, are protected.  Is it not the very nature of an investment, of risk taking, that good investments make money and bad investments lose money?  With the Government's proposal, that principle, that eternal truth since people started trading, has been turned on its head.  The banks and those from whom they borrowed for years made successful investments that paid off handsomely.  However, when they made bad investments, when they went over the top in reckless lending, the tab is to be picked up, not by those who made the investments but by the taxpayers, their children and probably grandchildren.With that kind of cushion, that kind of safety net, who would not be a bondholder or a banker?  It is the most wonderful profession to be in.  If we pick up the tab for the banks in the way that is proposed, what is to stop them picking themselves up and starting all over again?  If there is not some pain for the reckless lending, no lesson is learned.  The incentive for caution, prudence and responsible liquidity ratios must be at the heart of all banking and risk taking.  The Minister told us there would be pain for the banks and that NAMA would not overpay for assets.  Of course it will overpay for assets — that was the whole purpose of NAMA.  If it does not overpay for bank assets, the banks may as well sell them at the going rate, whenever or wherever they can.For the banks there is no pain, no penalty, in taking the long-term economic value and discounting it to present day values, if one assumes as the Government does — regardless of what it claims — that property prices will resume their upward trajectory.  To be given the future value of an asset in the current economic climate is a sweetheart deal.  Every unfortunate house owner who is now in negative equity or anyone trying to sell a house at present would love that deal.  They would love the long-term economic value of their house but they will not get it.  That will only be available to the banks.The Green Party, recognising just how this deal is sticking in the craw of every right thinking person came up with what is called risk-sharing — the issuing to the banks of some subordinated bonds.  As far as we can gather very few will be issued, but no doubt that could lessen the loss.  However, to call that risk-sharing is either to mislead or to misunderstand what is meant by risk-sharing.  Any financial investment carries risk, which involves the possibility of gain as well as loss.  NAMA offers no possibility of gain to taxpayers.  The subordinated bonds may lessen the loss, but will not give them any possibility of gain.  In the short term there will be no increase in the flow of credit, and in the longer term, assuming the banks survive — which is by no means certain — and prosper again, the taxpayer will have little or no share if the Minister has his way.  It is strange that the Minister maintained all along he would not over-pay, yet today he is defending the proposal by saying it is in the national interest and he has no alternative.If proof were needed that taxpayers will pay too much for these assets, it is the obscene and unapologetic clamour by the banks during the summer to offer further millions to Zoe Developments, just to nurse it along so that it can avail of NAMA, when we will all pay to bail it out.  To copper-fasten the view of what a charmed deal the banks were getting — this drove people demented — a Canadian bank expressed an interest in purchasing AIB, but of course after the establishment of NAMA, when it would have got rid of its rubbish balance sheet and its bad debts.  Who would not buy it then?  If the remaining good banks are good enough for other buyers, why are they not good enough for the Irish taxpayer?  If NAMA is to go ahead — presumably the Greens will let us know at some point whether it will go ahead — then the haircut should be severe enough to reflect reality.If the taxpayer is footing the bill for all this, it should be by recapitalising on the basis of an equity stake in the banks.  Then at least we will own what we are paying for many times over.  I do not understand why the Government is so reluctant to take a bank shareholding.  Other governments have done so.  I am not talking about banana republics: the UK Government, for example, now owns 70% of Lloyds Bank, that bastion of capitalism, and the shutters have not come down.  The world did not end.  Of course it is possible, and other governments are doing it.  Why, for God's sake, has the Government bought the totally banjaxed Anglo Irish Bank and taken a full shareholding in it, while it shies away from even partial ownership of banks that might recover and repay the taxpayer?The truth is that it has been led by the nose by bankers since August 2008.  It got their version of the problem and it got their preferred solution, and that has dictated everything that has happened since and everything that is planned.  It is time to stop listening to the banks and start considering alternatives.  The Government must look at the issue from another perspective and think of the taxpayer.  There are other ways of dealing with this problem and even of handling NAMA.  I plead with the Minister not to gallop down the path he has taken simply because he has started down that path.The legislation for NAMA sets out seven objectives, but it cannot achieve any of them.  It will not get credit flowing, which is ostensibly the whole purpose.  It does not protect taxpayers' interests — indeed, the Government has failed utterly to protect taxpayers' interests.  We have put billions of euro in already and it has disappeared down a black hole.  It may be years before we realise the full cost of NAMA to the taxpayer — although we will see quickly that credit will not start to flow — by which time the Minister and other Ministers may be gone.  It is a shocking legacy to leave behind and not one the Government or Ministers want, but there is still time to avoid that legacy.I wish to speak about the content of the legislation and what is not contained in it.  One of the things that bothers me is that there is nothing in the Bill to protect the taxpayer's interest when there is a conflict of interest between how the bank manages its loans and how it manages NAMA's loans.  There will be a conflict of interest in this regard, but there is no clarity about how the taxpayer will be protected.  The banks will run rings around us, as they have done before.  Nor will they be nearly as robust in collecting debts for NAMA as they will be in collecting their own debts.I am sorry there is no member of the Green Party present.  This party produced a wonderful concession that it wrung from the Government, namely, that it would be an offence to write a letter to NAMA.  It is a complete joke to make that an offence, as if NAMA needed protection from the public.  The reverse is true.  This legislation is giving it enormous powers, beyond anything we have ever given to an organisation, with public interest not involved.  There is no accountability; the Minister can increase its powers and allow it to do almost anything.  There is no protection for the public whatsoever.  If the public cannot write letters to NAMA, who can make representations to it?  Who can tell it what is happening on the ground?  It is essential that the powers of the Minister and of NAMA are totally vested in the Oireachtas.  That is an important part of the legislation.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I wish to share time with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the debate on it.  I must mention something that has sickened me more than anything else during the debate on NAMA.  I will qualify my remarks by saying I have the utmost respect for both Opposition parties which have put forward alternatives to the NAMA proposal.  I respect that fully.  However, many have made the populist remark that the Government is bailing out bankers and developers.  I welcome Deputy Coveney's honesty in his contribution when he acknowledged that the efforts by the Government to stabilise the banking system were in good faith and he did not doubt they were genuine.  It is refreshing to hear a member of the main Opposition party say this in the House.  It was not just members of political parties but also members of the media who consistently used that line, because it was popular with the public to lay blame at the door of Fianna Fáil and state that we would go on to bail out bankers and developers.  These people disgust me with the way they have carried on, and they can hang their heads in shame tonight as this House sits to consider alternatives and discuss a solution to the problem that will give our economy the prospect of growth.  I look forward to this happening in the coming months.This is the most spoken about Bill in the history of the State.  This is only natural because it will have an impact on everybody's life.  The purpose of the Bill — we are sensible enough to admit this, as Deputy Coveney did — is to restore confidence in the banking system and ensure credit can flow to those in the small business and farming communities and to households.  In the last number of months credit has not flowed into these areas, and all Members, in their clinics and advice centres, have met people on a daily basis who give us anecdotal evidence that it is not going to those people who need it most.  We are sensible enough to understand that if a solution is not found, whatever it may be, we will be in the same position in 12 months or two years' time, and credit still will not flow to those who need it.  We must realise that this is the case.What has got us where we are?  In my opinion, it is greed and a lack of personal responsibility.  We saw a disgraceful performance from the Financial Regulator, yet the chief executive sailed off into the sunset, well recompensed, as was the culture of the day.  I do not blame anybody for that because there were contractual obligations, I presume, and legal issues.  We have a culture in our society whereby people who are entrusted with responsibility to defend the interest of the taxpayer can finish up with a golden handshake and a huge pension and sail off into the sunset.  It is time to change that, and I welcome the changes made up to this point by the Minister for Finance with regard to recompensing bankers, encompassing a reduction in their salaries and limits on bonuses.  It is high time this happened, and we must go further, because it has sickened the public to see such appalling behaviour across many sectors.I welcome the improvement in regulation introduced by the Minister.  I also welcome the departure from a single financial regulator to a central regulatory authority combining the Financial Regulator's office and the Central Bank.  I welcome the appointment of Professor Honohan and wish him well in a difficult job.I wish to cite a few examples of reckless banking.  An e-mail I received from a constituent who was a director of a building and development company, qualified in project management and finance, states:We as a company have not purchased development land since 2005, we do an appraisal on every single project in advance of negotiating with land owners and our financiers.  Any projects that we looked at in '05/'06 and '07 did not stack up in our appraisals.In 2007, we were looking at a particular project, we spoke to 3 commercial lenders to provide finance, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank and Anglo Irish Bank.  Bank of Ireland said "no thanks lads", A.I.B. hounded us for the business offering 110% finance, Anglo Irish Bank looked at our appraisal and would only offer finance on a 60/40 Loan to Value [basis].In my opinion the A.I.B. proposal of financing even in July '07 of 110% was absolute reckless lending practices, especially when the financial crisis was beginning in the USA.  This type of financing was commonplace at A.I.B.That is one example of the behaviour of bankers.In regard to personal borrowing, a constituent of mine in Newcastlewest managed to borrow €74,000 by way of letters of offer in the post and telephone calls without ever standing inside the door of a financial institution.  That is absurd and appalling.  The person in question cannot afford to repay that loan or anywhere near that amount.  It was wrong to allow that person to borrow that amount of money.With regard to local banking, many years ago local bank managers were in a position of authority and could approve an overdraft facility, mortgage or a personal or term loan for their customers.  That practice changed five or six years ago, not on foot of the banking crisis.  The local bank manager cannot approve or increase an overdraft facility or approve any type of personal borrowing but a computer system can spit out letters that are issued to customers who might be with the bank for only six months, advising them that they now qualify to borrow up to €5,000 or €10,000.

The bank manager lived locally and knew the bank's clientele and the bona fides of its customers, their background and where they worked.  No person was in a better position to judge whether a loan should issue to a customer.  The banks seem to have moved away from that practice, which was probably considered unfashionable, and have gone to the other extreme.  That is why people have amassed huge personal debt which they should not have been able to do.It is time we learned from our past mistakes.  We must all acknowledge that we have a level of personal responsibility.  While we can lay blame at the door of the banks, and rightly so, blame can be also apportioned in some instances to people who decided not to exercise their personal responsibility and were happy to borrow money in the knowledge that it would be extremely difficult for them to repay it.I welcome the Bill.  I am confident the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will ensure the maximum protection for taxpayers.  It is vital that we do.  I am pleased the Minister in the Bill recognises that we have to learn from our past mistakes and I am glad to have had this opportunity to make a brief contribution.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The scale of the economic challenge facing Ireland is unprecedented.  Our banking system is in crisis and businesses and households across the country are struggling.  In response, the Government has devised a carefully considered solution to our financial sector difficulties — the National Assets Management Agency, NAMA.  In simple terms, NAMA will help banks to access cash to lend to businesses which, in turn, will stimulate our severely damaged economy.The NAMA Bill contains a number of important changes that will allow the agency to achieve its goal of stabilising the banking sector and restoring the flow of credit to businesses.  At the same time, NAMA minimises risk to the taxpayer.  Without a functioning banking sector, viable businesses and households across the country cannot access credit.  This would mean more businesses would close and more jobs would be lost.  As a result, our ability to deliver public services and invest in public infrastructure would be undermined.The bottom line is that banks are struggling to access funding because of concerns at home and abroad about risky property and development loans on their balance sheets.  Due to the size of the economy, Irish banks are heavily reliant on accessing funding from foreign financial institutions.  Getting this funding is proving difficult and costs are high.  As a result, Irish banks are restricting credit.NAMA will clean up the balance sheets of Irish banks and allow them to focus on their core business.  It will strengthen and improve their funding position so they can lend to viable businesses and households.  Some commentators have asserted that NAMA is about bailing out bankers and property developers, but that is not correct.Contrary to what some have claimed, NAMA will not buy the loans with money that could have been spent on public services.  NAMA will issue bonds to the banks, essentially lOUs.  The interest on these bonds will be paid out of the income NAMA receives from the good loans it takes over.  Proceeds on loan repayments and property sales are expected to pay off in full the bonds that NAMA issues.  These bonds can be exchanged for cash on world markets and at the European Central Bank.  In other words, tens of billions in cash from outside the country will be pumped into our economy through the banking system.  That will stimulate our economy.Above all, the Government's primary concern is the welfare of the people.  The Government is determined to put in place provisions to protect the taxpayer.  There will be no easy terms available to borrowers from NAMA.  They will be expected to pay the full amount owed by them in exactly the same way as they are obliged to pay their banks now.  For borrowers who will not or cannot repay their loans according to the terms of their contracts, NAMA will pursue these using all the commercial and legal means at its disposal to obtain the maximum return.  In addition, this Bill contains a specific provision to outlaw lobbying of NAMA in respect of any of its decisions.  Any involvement by borrowers in the development or completion of properties acquired by NAMA will be strictly controlled.Our common cause must now be the future of Ireland and her people.  One would expect that this should not be a time for political parties taking populist positions.  The stakes are far too high for that.  Yet, the Opposition parties continue to treat the economy as the plaything of political expedience.  Fine Gael is at odds with two of its own former leaders on an approach to the banking crisis.  Perhaps that is no surprise when one considers the party's proposal for a wholesale bank which, oddly enough, would not come into play until next October when the bank guarantee scheme runs out.I have news for Fine Gael.  Ireland cannot wait 13 months before trying to clean up the banks and kick-start the economy.  Fine Gael's magic wholesale bank would supposedly get €2 billion in capital from the State and be able to borrow €40 billion from European Central Bank.  This is not practical because the European Central Bank demands collateral.  The wholesale bank would have to raise deposits and these almost certainly would be funds withdrawn from the current banks.  Alternatively, the State would have to provide the wholesale bank with between €50 billion and €60 billion in bonds.  There would be no benefit to the economy since the banks have access to the European Central Bank.Fine Gael wants to default on the bondholders of Irish banks, but the so-called professional investors to whom the party refers are pension funds, insurance companies and other long-term savings institutions that provide funds to banks here so that they can in turn lend to businesses and households.  Defaulting on the providers of money to Irish banks would dry up funding.  Those are the same providers of funds that are lending to us to finance our budget deficit and to keep State services running.I wish to deal with the Labour Party's plan also.  Labour wants to impose a 50% discount on the loans being transferred to NAMA.  It has picked that number——

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	504	That would achieve Labour's ideologically driven goal of a fully State-owned banking system.  Labour's approach is in violation of EU Commission rules since the Commission insists that valuations must be determined following a due diligence examination of each loan.  Under NAMA, each loan will be valued one by one.  The Commission does not allow a flat discount across all loans as Labour proposes.The Government has ruled out the full nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland on the basis of information from due diligence or stress test exercises undertaken in March and other information on expected future bank losses indicating that full nationalisation is unnecessary.  Once an institution is fully nationalised, the State must sustain the institution.  Anglo Irish Bank is a case in point.  The State is obliged to ensure that the minimal capital is maintained in that institution.  If that is not done, the institution ceases to be a bank and all the liabilities become an immediate charge on the State and the taxpayer.  If Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland were fully nationalised, shareholders would have to be compensated with cash from the State.  At current share prices, that could mean a €5 billion cash payout.  Where does the Labour Party propose the State finds that money?  That is before a single cent of new capital has been injected.  Full nationalisation would inevitably result in the downgrading of Ireland's sovereign credit rating and the State would be obliged to pay higher interest rates on its borrowings.Under the Labour Party's plan, banks would be removed from the stock market.  One can ask how the Labour Party would propose that the State would sell off its stakes over time and when it would do so.  How would fully nationalised banks perform in the interim?  The Labour Party cannot cost its proposal because once the State assumes total responsibility for the financial sector, the cost could be endless.

Full nationalisation is the nuclear option.  It is no coincidence that the only country to have fully nationalised its banking system during this crisis is Iceland.  The Labour Party would do well to remember that, instead of playing fast and loose with our economy.  The Minister for Finance said that within the legal boundaries in which it must operate, and notwithstanding its commercial remit, NAMA could have a role in creating balanced and desirable places to live with obvious benefits for sustainable social values.  He said that NAMA could seek to facilitate the Department's of Education and Science and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government where these bodies have requirements, for example, in terms of schools and parks, which facilitate the creation of desirable developments that encourage vibrant sustainable communities.  He said that such bodies could be given first option on disposals for a limited period and although they would have to pay the reasonable market price required they would at least be given the first mover advantage.  As Minister for Education and Science, I very much welcome that proposal and I look forward to pursuing it.Our mission is to have a healthy banking system that meets the needs of the wider community.  If we do not act now to free our banks of their higher-risk loans, we will not be in a position to benefit from the economic recovery that appears to be emerging in the United States and in Europe.  Without a healthy and functioning banking system, our businesses and service providers will not be able to grow and develop their products for our main markets.  If we do not stand ready to take advantage of a global upturn as an open free-market economy dependent on foreign direct investment and international capital flows, we will lose market share and more jobs.  Now is the time to act.  The time for talk has passed.  The Government will not shirk its responsibilities to this generation or those to come.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I was elected to this Chamber in 1977.  Twice in my time in this Chamber I have seen Fianna Fáil bring this country to the brink of bankruptcy — in 1979 to 1980 and in the past year and a half.  This Bill is coming from the same party with the same political ethos and the same recklessness that precipitated the previous bankruptcy threat and the current one.  It is no wonder that the Irish economic crash is much worse than in any other member state of the European Union.  The reasons are because of the scale of the property-driven inflation that was whooped and cheered on by Fianna Fáil.  What is extraordinary is that we have yet to hear one word of apology from the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, or his predecessor, or one word of admission that they had got it wrong but that they are trying to correct it.  We heard nothing of that nature this afternoon during Leaders' Questions.  We have not got a sense in any way that they are responsible for the mess in which we find ourselves.We have a complete and comprehensive financial and economic crisis.  It is not just about the banks nor just about NAMA.  What the Labour Party has proposed, in contrast to what it has been caricatured as offering, is something along the following lines.  We need to restore credibility in the economic system and in those who are responsible for managing the financial services sector in particular if we are to attract and retain the type of investment we have so far enjoyed.  Our proposal to do that is to establish a financial banking commission headed up by an Irish person of international reputation, such as Niall Fitzgerald, for example, but significantly also with members such as a retired German central banker or a retired American central banker, people from outside the shores of this island, because not every investor in the world has an Irish grandmother and looks favourably on the old sod.  We need to restore credibility and objectivity.We then need to turn to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  I hold the view that all the members of the board of the Central Bank should be asked to submit their resignations at this point because they were part of a regulatory system that failed.  I welcome the appointment of Professor Honohan.  His international reputation is precisely what we need to restore credibility, but he should be assisted with a new board.I wish to deal with the issue that has been the subject of so many deliberate political slurs and misrepresentations coming out of the Pravda section of the Fianna Fáil press office.  It is no coincidence that the same line was used in the speeches of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe.  I repeat what the Labour Party has said: if one pays a reasonable price for the distressed assets, the likelihood is that one will have to recapitalise the two main retail banks, not all the banks, just the two main ones, so they can get back to the high street business of facilitating business and liquidity.  There is nowhere in any Labour Party proposal for the words “blanket nationalisation”.  We have never referred to 100% nationalisation.  We are talking about temporary public ownership, in the region of 70% plus, which we will probably have anyway.The banks will stay quoted on the Stock Exchange.  The shareholders will not have their shares confiscated.  The toxic loans would be taken out and some form of NAMA set up, whether a bad bank as in the Fine Gael proposal or based on our system.  Some form of NAMA is required to separate non-performing toxic loans from the balance sheets of the banks so the main banking activity can continue.The boards of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland must complete their exit.  So far, their chief executives and chairpersons have left but why stop there?  We need new and properly appointed boards and the Opposition should be consulted by Government in this regard.  I welcome the limited consultation we have had so far.  The new tier of management that would come to the fore in those two banks — which currently have good management through the ranks — would be told they would receive no bonuses and no excessive salaries, that it is our intention to refloat 100% onto the market those banks temporarily in public ownership and that their bonus will be 5% to 10% of the realised value.  This would be the incentive to management to achieve the best result.We would say to the shareholders that we are sorry that they have, as a result of mismanagement of the economy under Fianna Fáil, lost their shirts and that dividends have been suspended.  Most people who invested in bank shares did so not for capital appreciation of those shares but for the dividend income they provided.  Those people who have held bank shares for the past 20 or 30 years did so for dividends, income that provided the most secure kind of pension available to them at that time.  They have already lost this.  We would say to the shareholders that we hope to again realise the value of these banks in seven to ten years and that the Irish state will take back in the realised profits only that amount of money invested by the taxpayer through the Government in the first instance and that whatever is left will be theirs.  While they may not ever see that money their children or grandchildren will see it.  That model has been used successfully in many other countries.Let me nail another Pravda lie from the Fianna Fáil press office about political interference in a State-run, State-owned financial institution.  We have one from the stable of the Department of Finance.  The life assurance companies in this country got into trouble in the 1930s and had to be bailed out and rescued.  They were rescued by a State-owned entity, Irish Life, which was 95% plus owned by the State.  The shareholding was held by the Minister for Finance and there was a residual private shareholding left over from the chaos that was rescued by the State payers.  Nobody ever suggested that Irish Life was subject to political interference in the same way that the ESB, Bord na Móna or CIE had been subject to political interference.  There was no corruption of the commercial mandate from Merrion Street and rightly so.  When that bank was subsequently successfully privatised over a number of years shareholders ended up getting money.Our biggest problem is that there are two people to be protected in this bail-out.  This is a bail-out of one kind or another whether the discount is 30% or 70%.  I welcome to the House the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, with whom I debated this point on a television programme some time ago.  We both agreed that the critical point is the price.  We now know the critical price.  It is a 30% discount as distinct from what the High Courts were saying to Mr. Carroll should be a 70% discount.  Whether the discount is 30%, 50% or 70% — which would be disastrous — the question is whether the taxpayer is to have a degree of subsidy in all of this.  I agree that some form of subsidy is required but what does the taxpayer get under the NAMA proposals currently before us?  We get nothing.  If we are in the seat whereby we receive part or temporary ownership of whatever the amount happens to be and the banks are refloated then the taxpayer gets that gain.Senator Share Ross said this afternoon on radio that it was significant that the stock market in Ireland was closed when the Minister was making his speech to the House.  He predicted that when the markets open tomorrow the banks will be excessively happy and the market will have bounced up their value.  That is a critical assessment from the only qualified stockbroker in these Houses.  This gives us first sight of what will be the impact of the NAMA route as currently pursued by the Government.None of us has been here before.  The Government has proposed a solution that we do not believe is a great solution and we have outlined alternatives.  However, following conclusion of the Second Stage debate we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to get right whatever proposal is now on the table.  I hope that the arrogance and tribal negativism that we have witnessed so far from Fianna Fáil will not close its mind and ears to the expertise in this House as referred to earlier by Deputy Burton.  Sadly, listening to the contributions from the Taoiseach and the Minister, I will not hold my breath.This issue is too big for any of us.  The Government will not be in office following the next election.  That issue has effectively been decided and the Government knows that as well as us.  Let us get this right so that we do not have to pick up the pieces after the general election is called.

I take this opportunity to thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to register Sinn Féin's complete opposition to the NAMA proposals.I must hand it to the Government, it is doing a great job robbing the people of this State.  White collar crime is taken to a different level when the collar in question is the Minister for Finance.  We discovered today that NAMA will cost the Irish people €54 billion, which is approximately €12,000 for every man, woman and child in the State and that is before recapitalisation.  Let us use the recent example of the Mr. Carroll case and the High Court's prediction that €77 billion worth of loans would be lucky to be repaid at €20 billion.  This State is paying €54 billion for them, which is robbery.  However, we are told by the elected representatives sitting opposite, it is a necessary robbery.The banks loaned too much to a small number of profit-mad, greedy developers and the Government cheered them on with billions in tax-breaks.  Now, our banking system has collapsed.  Capitalism brought about the downfall but we cannot let capitalism sort itself out.  The taxpayer must step in with €54 billion and bail out the banks, the developers and the most corrupt Government in the history of the State.  We can privatise profit but we must socialise debt.We cannot put any of this down to ineptitude. This Government knows exactly what it is doing to the people.  Fianna Fáil has a tradition of stealing from the taxpayer and then lying about it.  Former Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey is a classic case in point and former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had his own little misdemeanours.  However, it is not alone those at the top of the party but councillors up and down the land who are up to their necks in sorry, seedy and greedy affairs.  The words "brown" and "envelope" could have been invented for the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have witnessed rezoning with brown envelopes handed over to corrupt councillors to ensure developers got their way.  However, what they have done to date is nothing compared to what they are planning to do.  Not only are they robbing this generation, they are robbing the next and future generations.The long-term economic value is a particular coup.  Why would we want to push land prices up to the same level they reached at the height of the boom?  How did these prices affect our competitiveness?  If land does not reach these prices the State may well have shelled out more than €20 billion too much.  A figure of €20 billion, which is a conservative estimate, would pay for a world-class free health service, an education system and a social security system.  It is enough money to build a country to which tourists would want to come and in which business wants to invest.   However, to Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, that figure is just a number.  Who cares, they will not be in government when it all comes crashing down, which is the great thing about politics and postponement.  The leader of the Green Party, Deputy John Gormley, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, will be living comfortably on ministerial pensions when the real impact of NAMA hits.As stated earlier, it is the next and future generations that will pay for this.  Sinn Féin has been calling all summer for a referendum on NAMA.  One cannot put through a Bill of this magnitude without asking the majority of the people of this island if they support it.  We all know why Fianna Fáil will not hold a referendum.  They know asking people to vote "Yes" to NAMA is like asking turkeys to vote for Christmas.  We are calling on all Deputies and Senators to sign the petition we have circulated calling on the President to initiate a referendum on this proposal.  This issue is of such importance that it is imperative we ask the people what they want.  Opposition Members, Independents and Government backbenchers will have the opportunity to step up to the mark by standing up to bankers, developers and the Government in its proposal for NAMA.  To do otherwise is to capitulate to the powerful players in the banking system.There is a way out of the black hole Fianna Fáil, together with its friends, the developers and speculators, has dug for this country.  That way out is via nationalisation of the banking system.  It would cost money but less so than NAMA.  Moreover, taxpayers would then own the banks and they could be cleared out once and for all.  It would be a people's banking system.  Sinn Féin is not interested in temporary nationalisation as proposed by the Labour Party.  We cannot advocate handing back the banks to the very people who  ruined them.  How can one justify allowing those who brought the country to its knees to remain in charge?  Instead, we propose the creation of a State bank which would foster the economy and give ordinary citizens the right to a bank account and a secure and affordable mortgage.  The reality is that the Government knows it may need to nationalise the banks in the wake of NAMA.  Its protestations to the contrary are another example of how it has lied to the people.  It is merely dragging out the cronyism for as long as possible.  Private property contractors will get to tender for the land taken over by NAMA.  The key question is what price the latter will accept.The Green Party's additional bows and ribbons do nothing to protect the taxpayer.  That party should be ashamed of itself for what it is doing, with its Members desperately clinging onto their jobs while they hang the people out to dry.  For many years I sat in this House listening to Green Party Members making constructive proposals.  Now they have reneged on everything for which they stood.  They are pathetic.  They should take five minutes out from pretending to save the planet and try to save the people who put them in this Parliament.Sinn Féin is opposing NAMA because it is ultimately an attempt to legalise corruption.  It is all about taxpayers picking up the tab for Galway tent politics.  It is not only a step too far, it is a step off the cliff.  The Government has pushed the people as far as they can be pushed.  It is no longer a Government of the people.  Its support has collapsed and it is now a dictatorship.  NAMA is devised primarily to bail out bankers and developers.  It was this same Galway tent cartel that exploited the economy for personal gain.  It is the same cartel which, with the oil companies, has exploited our national resources for profit.  The same cartel will now, through NAMA, exploit ordinary, decent taxpayers.The people do not support Fianna Fáil's solutions to the economic crisis it caused and they do not want the Government.  Fianna Fáil no longer has a mandate.  If it proceeds with NAMA, pushes through all the cuts recommended by an bord snip nua and delivers the budget everybody is expecting, it will have ruined us.  It should put itself to the test by calling an election and seeking support for its policies, but I have no expectation it will do so.  Like the Green Party, Fianna Fáil will try to cling to power for as long as possible.Throughout the State, viable small businesses are striving to survive and continue providing employment for ten or 15 people in their locality.  Small businesses are the largest employers in rural areas but they are being driven to death's door by the refusal of the banks to provide credit.  These institutions are the landlords of the 21st century.  They oversee the very system that has contributed to the wreckage of the economy but are now begging the Government, via the taxpayer, to bail them out.  It is ordinary people who must pay for the mistakes made by those in charge of the banking system.Mortgage holders throughout the State, many of them young couples, are dependent on two incomes to meet their loan repayments.  The same bankers the Government proposes to bail out are evicting people from their homes, taking ownership of their properties and then leasing them back to the former occupants.  That is what is happening throughout the island.  NAMA proposes to protect and bail out these banking interests.  We propose instead that the system be nationalised.  It is the people who should own the banks and these institutions must help those in need and deserving of support.  That is the only way in which we can hope to restore the economy and have a country that reflects the ideals of those who founded it.

Tá an-bhéim á chur ar chúrsaí luachála, chomh fada agus a bhaineann siad le NAMA.  Sílim gur cheart dúinn breathnú ar an cheist leathan lena bhfuilimid ag plé inniu — an chaoi ina fheidhmeoidh an tír muna bhfuil córas baincéireachta éifeachtach ann.  Cé go bhfuil an córas baincéireachta thar a bheith tábhachtach don phobal agus don eacnamaíocht, caithfear a rá go bhfuil an eacnamaíocht ann don phobal.  Má bhreathnaímíd ar ghnáth-dhaoine, mar a dúirt an Teachta Ferris, tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach don dream atá ag iarraidh gnó a dhéanamh muna bhfuil córas baincéireachta ann.  Cén chaoi is féidir le daoine gnó a rith i gceart gan córas baincéireachta?  Muna bhfuil córas baincéireachta ann, níl aon chreidmheas ar fáil do ghnáth-dhaoine atá ag iarraidh teach a thógáil nó airgead a fháil le haghaidh míle cúis.Dar ndóigh, tá daoine ag déanamh dearmad ar rud eile — muna bhfuil an eacnamaíocht ag feidhmiú, ní bheidh muid mar Stát in ann seirbhísí a chur ar fáil don phobal.  Le cúpla seachtain anuas, tá an-chaint faoin gcontúirt a bheadh ann dá mbeadh an luacháil ró-ard — d'fhéadfaimis roinnt billiúin euro a chailleadh de bharr sin.  Creidfimid go bhfuil sé sin clúdaithe sa Bhille.  Beidh contúirt i bhfad níos mó ann muna bhfuil an eacnamaíocht ag feidhmiú.  Má tá difríocht de €3 billiún i gceist in aghaidh na bliana, ó thaobh foinse ioncaim de, idir an eacnamaíocht a bheith ag fás agus gan bheith ag fás, táimid ag caint mar gheall ar difríocht de €30 billiún i gcistí an Stáit laistigh de thréimhse deich mbliana.  Creidim go bhfuil figiúr den chineál sin coimeádach.  Má fhágaimid rudaí mar atá siad, beidh an bearna idir an chaoi ina bhfuil rudaí agus an chaoi ina bhféadfaidís a bheith má leanfaimid le NAMA i bhfad níos mó ná €3 billiún in aghaidh na bliana.  Mar sin, nuair atá NAMA á scrúdú againn, ní chóir dúinn na cúng-socruithe airgeada nó baincéireachta amháin a scrúdú.  Caithfimid breathnú ar an tionchar a bheidh acu ar an eacnamaíocht.  Caithfimid ceist a chur orainn fhéin — cé acu is fearr ó thaobh an eacnamaíocht, séirbhísí poiblí agus postanna de?  Nach bhfuil sé níos fearr, ioncam a bhailiú don Rialtas agus Stáit chun a chaitheamh ar sheirbhísí, ná airgead a thógáil ar iasacht?  Dá bhrí sin, tá sé soiléir go gcaithfimid rud éigin mór agus ceart a dhéanamh.Ba mhaith liom rud eile a léiriú sa díospóireacht seo.  Cloisim an-chuid caint ar bhaincéirí, ar bhainc agus ar airgead na mbainc.  Go minic, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil daoine ag smaoineamh ar cé is leis an chuid is mó don airgead atá sna mbainc.  Shílfeá gur le dream beag daoine an t-airgead ar fad atá sna mbainc, ach ní mar sin atá.  Má rachfaimid go dtí foinse na billiúin euro a bhíonn á láimhseáil ag daoine áirithe sna margaí éagsúla, gheobhfaimid amach gurb é mo chuid airgead agus do chuid airgead atá i gceist.  Duine ar bith a bhfuil taisce acu sa bhanc nó sa chomhar chreidmheasa, caithfidh siad a thuiscint go gcuirtear na dtaiscí ar fad le chéile.  Déanann na chomhair chreidmheasa infheistiú i mbainc eile.  Dá dteipfeadh ar na mbainc, cá mbeadh an t-airgead sin ansin?  Bíonn daoine ag caint mar gheall ar bannaí airgeadais.  Tá níos mó eolais ag pobal na hÉireann ar na mbannaí seo ar fad anois ná mar a bhí trí nó ceithre seachtain ó shin.  Céard iad fhéin, áfach?  Sa chuid is mó, is iad na bannaí na fréamhacha a cothaíonn do phinsean nó d'íocaíocht árachais.  Cuirtear na cistí ar fad le chéile istigh sna comhlachtaí pinsean nó árachais agus déantar iad a infheistiú.  Má theipeann ar na mbainc, gheobhfaidh gach mac máthair sa tír seo amach go tobann go bhfuil sé thíos leis go pearsanta.Táimse den tuairim go bhfuil an oiread fíbín ar dhaoine breathnú ar na droch-baincéirí seo.  Ní miste leo cé a ghortóidís sa bhealach.  Tá sé cosúil le buama adamhach a úsáid chun duine mí-ionraic a scriosadh, agus a rá gur cuma sa diabhal go bhfuil na céadta míle maraithe agat.  Is mar a chéile é sa chás seo.  Mar sin, ní díogh liom go dtuigeann duine ar bith a deireann nach gá córas baincéireachta a bheith ann an tsúnámaí a leanfadh teip ar an gcóras sin.Before discussing the detail of the various proposals, it is important to examine the fundamental issue of what action needs to be taken.  Those who advocate the nuclear option of allowing the banks to go under and those who argue that we do not need a banking system do not know who are the ultimate owners of much of the money in the various funds and bonds and do not realise the vital importance of the banking system in day-to-day business.  We must have a functioning banking system.  As Deputy Ferris noted, many small business owners cannot secure access to credit.  Deputies will also be aware of individuals who cannot access credit, including young people who wish to purchase a house, and others who require loans for various purposes.  It is important, therefore, to reflect on the importance of a functioning banking system.We have heard a great deal in this debate about who takes the risk.  The banking system is discussed as if it functioned in isolation from the society in which we live.  Let us compare the status quo with a scenario in which the banking system is functioning again, credit is flowing, business can be done and jobs are created.  Let us consider this scenario solely in terms of the increase in tax revenue we would secure.  Leaving aside the social and human anguish of proceeding on the current path, the economic impact would be to starve people of cash, thus ensuring that business is not done and a large number of people remain unemployed.  It is my conservative estimate that the lift we would get restarting the economy would result in an annual increase of €3 billion in income to the State from taxation.  With tax revenue this year expected to be approximately €33 billion, an increase of €3 billion or 10% would be relatively small, particularly when one considers that annual tax revenues were running at €55 billion at one point.  Nevertheless, over a period of ten years, the increase would amount to €30 billion.  Every other risk associated with our proposal pales into insignificance when set against the risk of doing nothing.One hears a great deal about bankers and the banking system.  I do not know any bankers, not even my bank manager, or developers.  I keep away from such activities and lead a simple life, which has been devoted to community work.  To imagine, however, that bank bonds and so forth relate solely to rich people's money is to fail to understand the nature of the banking system.  I have often noted the large sum of money held in our credit unions.  I believe it stands at €7 billion or €8 billion.  When a large number of people save a little, the money accumulates and enters the banking system.  Anyone who would even contemplate allowing the entire system to fall is proposing Armageddon for ordinary people whose deposits, insurance premia and pensions payments would be wiped out.Those who work in the offices of financial institutions move large sums of money around the system through various investments.  Much of this money consists of the pension contributions, insurance premia and deposits of ordinary people.  Those who are not required to assume responsibility may speak banally about getting bankers but forget that they propose to use a nuclear missile to hit their target.  They do not care whether 100,000 or 200,000 people are washed away in the tsunami that follows.Having examined the various options, while I do not agree with the Sinn Féin proposal to nationalise the banks, at least it emanates from a principled position, one which would have been popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  It reflects a view that in some way a nationalised bank would become a people's bank.  I do not believe that would happen, even in the case of full nationalisation, because such a bank would be subject to the same conditions and lending practices in the money markets as any privately owned bank.  The NAMA solution provides for public interest directors of banks and offers an incentive for ordinary business.  This mix provides the best of two worlds which will serve our society and economy.From a philosophical point of view, I empathise with the idea that the people should own the banks but have less understanding for the Labour Party policy.  Having examined it from every angle, I just do not get it.  People are forgetting our Constitution, the nature of our society and property rights.  If we were to nationalise the banks, independent assessors would have to be appointed and full market value would have to be paid for the nationalised institution.  Such a proposal does not make sense.  If, for example, the banks were worth €4 billion, what would be the point of borrowing €4 billion at an interest rate of 4% to buy bank shares?  Such a move would not do anything for bank liquidity because all the money would go to shareholders.I am not an expert in constitutional law but the notion that one could appropriate a bank on the premise that shareholders would have some of the action at some point in the future does not stand up to scrutiny.  It is important in this debate that people are honest enough to admit if their proposals do not stand up to robust challenges.I examined closely the Fine Gael Party document which proposes, among other things, to move money between good and bad banks.  The endgame of its proposal appears to be to use a clever sleight of hand to make the subordinated loans worthless.  Somebody has to take a hit to get the balance sheet right.  If it is not the taxpayer, through refinancing the banks, it must be someone else.  This would be very handy if it was possible.All of these issues can be teased out.  Having followed the debate for months and having been privy to Cabinet discussions on the issue, I believe the Government proposal is a robust, effective and legally sound solution to the problem.  As regards valuations, I believe that when NAMA is finished it will at least break even and probably make a profit.  It is difficult to see that property prices will fall in real terms over the next ten years.  The up-valuation is only equivalent to an average, modest consumer price index rise in that period.There are those who say it would be glorious if property prices continued to fall.  Obviously property prices went way beyond where they should have gone, but those who say it would be great if they kept going down are forgetting all those who bought houses in the last five years and the disaster they would face if that scenario came to pass.  People who see ever falling property prices as a happy ending are ignoring a huge section of our population who borrowed money to buy houses and whose negative equity would be enormous if property prices were to fall further.As with everything in life, there is a happy medium.  One can price up the real value of a house and there is such an intrinsic value.  If one wants to get the real price of a house fairly accurately, one should ask a person who built a one-off rural house what the bricks, doors, windows and other bits cost and what labour cost, paying the fair, standard rates in our society.  To that, one must also add a modest amount for the site, which is the real intrinsic price.  If it falls much below that, the only people who will gain are those with a lot of cash resources who know that inevitably, sooner or later, property prices will come back to the bricks and mortar cost.  They will be able to make a killing in the certainty that there is a real price for this, not just some imaginary one.The Government provided figures today and it was bound to do so.  If assets are appropriated there will be performing loans.  We must remember that we are buying the loans secured by the assets.  There seems to be an idea that we are buying properties, but we are not; we are buying the full loan.  If one has a loan and one pays it fully to the bank there is no question of losing a property.  It is in the case of default that one's property comes into question.  Time and again we have stressed that properties will be valued individually, item by item.  I am sure that in some of these portfolios there will be different types of securities and each one will be valued on its real value, taking a long-term valuation on those for which it is appropriate to do so.We hear the example of a field in some town in the midlands or the west that was zoned for development and where enough houses have been built for the next 20 years.  It may have been bought at an exorbitant price, but if there is no chance of development, the Minister and Government spokespersons have said repeatedly that there will be no question but that it will be valued at its real price, i.e. the agricultural value.It is important to play straight and fair here.  In any debates I have had with Deputy Quinn on this issue he has been straight and up front.  He has been responsible in the way he has dealt with it.  I hope that when we get to Committee Stage, all sides of the House will work together to try to make the legislation even better.  We must try to see if there are flaws in the Bill and, if so, improve it.The idea of publishing a draft Bill was to give plenty of time to people to analyse, debate and examine it, and come up with suggestions.  Many changes have already been made, not to the fundamental principles which are absolutely sound, but to the details.  I look forward to a constructive debate with people addressing what everybody agrees is one of the huge challenges we face in the future.  I have no doubt that within this Bill we have the wherewithal to create a proper, functioning banking system that will serve our people well.  That will allow the economy to regrow.  There are still huge opportunities in our land.  In time to come it will be seen that Ireland's response to this crisis was constructive and imaginative and solved the problem.  I hope it will do so in a relatively short period.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	514	What happened today in this House reminds me of the day five friends of mine left Westport.  They were going to Kerry and on the way the Galway races were on.  They did not have much money and were going on holidays.  When they went to Galway they got a tip for a horse and decided to put all this money on it.  I am sorry to say, however, that the horse did not win.  That is the risk that taxpayers will have to put up with now.  This country has the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and other agencies which were fully staffed with taxpayers' money.  They all received benchmarking and were well paid.  A year ago the fraud squad investigators went into Anglo Irish Bank and now, almost a year on, not one person in the Department of Finance, the regulator's office or the Central Bank has lost his or her job.  When I saw the regulator's performance on "Prime Time", I was not surprised to see what happened with the banks in this country.  One would wonder who appointed him.  I do not know how he was appointed but I am sure people will tell me.  Where were the Department of Finance, the regulator and the Central Bank when this scandal was going on?In America, the man who defrauded taxpayers was brought in in handcuffs and is now in jail.  Our guys, however, are out sunning themselves abroad with taxpayers' money and we now have to bail them out.  It is not the first time we have had to bail them out.  Does the Minister remember when Anglo Irish Bank invested money in America?  This House had to be recalled and the taxpayer had to bail it out again.  Does he remember what happened to the PMPA?  We know who it supported.  We had scandals in the insurance industry and the taxpayer had to bail it out.

It is not about taxpayers, it is about Fianna Fáil builders who have subscribed to that party for the past 20 years.  I have been listening to the Minister and the puppets who come in with speeches written for them by the Department of Finance——

They got a site from their family and had saved €120,000.  They wanted €80,000 to finish the house but sought €100,000 because they wanted to decorate it.  They went to three banks in my town and not one would give them either amount.  They had put €120,000 into the house themselves.  They had a site which, at worst, was worth €50,000, giving them a property worth €170,000 and they could not secure €80,000 to complete their house.We are bailing out bankers and I hope, for the sake of the country, that this works.  I have no faith in Fianna Fáil and I have less faith in the Green Party because they have lost their way in office.  They did not lose their way today or yesterday but they did so over many months.  The people have made up their minds.  They want to get rid of Fianna Fáil.  They want the party out of government because they are sick and tired of the way they have been treated.  They are sick and tired of the way the party has looked after the economy.  They are sick and tired of the way Fianna Fáil has looked after its friends in every section of society.  They were fixed up in every corner that they could be fixed up and the State can no longer afford to pay them.  An bord snip nua had to be brought in because Ministers did not act the way they should have in government.As a Front Bench spokesperson for Fine Gael, I ask the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Department of Finance officials to let us know what is the up-to-date position regarding all the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and all the other banks before the legislation is passed.  I want that on the record of the House and I want to see people arrested for what they did.  Banking is a simple and basic business.  Bankers take in and loan out money but they loaned more than they had and they put their own shareholders and the country at risk.  We are the laughing stock of Europe and the world because the Minister and his colleagues, including former taoisigh and Minsters for Finance, went out to Europe with their chests out telling their colleagues that we had the best economy in the world.  We had so much money we were the most well off people in the world.  It was the greatest false economy there ever was and when Deputies Bruton, Burton and others tried to point out and identify what was happening in the real world, nobody in the Government listened.Have we qualified people in the Department of Finance?  Are they qualified in commerce?  Do they really know what is going on in the world?  Why could the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance not see between them that our banking institutions would bring the country down?  They did nothing about it.  The country could collapse and I do not want that to happen.  Some banks do not have a penny to lend and yet again hard-pressed taxpayers are keeping bankers in their jobs.  Some taxpayers could lose their jobs while others will have to take a reduction in their wages and work harder than ever.Nothing will have changed in five years' time if NAMA works.  Another Government could be before the House in ten or 15 years bailing the same bankers out because we did not learn.  I would love to say the banks should be nationalised but while I would love to see them be allowed to collapse, that would damage the country.  However, I want to see some of the people in Anglo Irish Bank jailed for the activities that took place.  They were supported by Fianna Fáil and Ministers and I want these people to be named and shamed.  Who drew down loans from these banks?  It was a scandal.  I have learned one thing since I entered politics, which is that there are two laws in the country.  There is one for the poor and one for the rich.  When I was elected to the Dáil many years ago, a man pulled me aside on the street.  He said, "You'll learn one thing, sonny, when you go into the Dáil.  It doesn't matter whether you are Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  When it comes to the rich, the poor will pay and the rich will always look after the rich".  That is what is happening.  The poor of this country will have to bail out the rich.  Developers have put their property into the names of their wives or children or have put it outside the State and I am glad the Minister for Finance said it can be taken off them and the taxpayer will not be paying for their bad loans while they save their good properties.I want the banks dealt with.  I want some action in the Department of Finance.  The regulator should have been sacked a long ago while the Central Bank failed to do its job.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	521	Both the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance mentioned two former Fine Gael Party leaders, Alan Dukes and Garret FitzGerald.  I respect both of them but they have not been right about everything in their careers and they are not right about NAMA.  We have heard very little about the views of former Fianna Fáil leaders on this legislation.  They have been silent but I am not surprised.  The party's previous leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was bankrolled personally by stockbrokers and developers and Charles Haughey was bailed out by the banks.  Through NAMA, Fianna Fáil is repaying the debts of its former leaders.In approaching this debate, we must ask what are the common principles and what we are all trying to achieve.  First, we want to minimise the risk to the taxpayer in any policy to save the banks.  Second, we want to repair the financial system in order that credit can flow again to small businesses, homeowners and consumers.  NAMA will not protect the taxpayer.  We were informed earlier that the book value of the loans is €77 billion, which includes €9 billion in rolled up interest.  It is not that long since Sean FitzPatrick told us the banks did not roll up interest for developers.  The real haircut is 20% and not 30%, as the Minister suggested earlier.  He also admitted the long-term economic value of the loans is €7 billion higher than the market value.  It is at least that amount because the figures also include the equity put in the developers and it remains to be seen how much is phantom equity.  It may be found that the cost to the taxpayer could be substantially higher than €7 billion and it could be as much as €16 billion.The Minister's calculations are based on two massive gambles.  The first is that property prices have bottomed out, having fallen 47% since the market peaked and this is where they will sit.  That is untrue.  Next year will be characterised, according to the Government's projections, by increasing unemployment, decreasing wages, which it has promised to cut, and higher ECB interest rates.  On that basis, there is a strong probability property prices will continue to fall.  It is at best a wish for the Minister to base his calculations on a 47% fall from peak but it is definitely a gamble.  All the Government's projections fall if property prices decrease further.  They could fall 1% a month over the next few months but once interest rates increase, prices will fall again and that will destroy the Minister's projections.The second gamble is the projection that NAMA will break even every year.  This is based on two arguments, one of which is that 40% of the assets to be purchased are performing.  That probably is the case but the Minister is assuming they will continue to perform once they have been taken over by the agency and once interest rates begin to increase next year.  That is a false assumption.  The Minister is assuming that because 40% of the loans are performing now, they will continue to perform next year.  That is a big gamble.  In addition, the entire exercise is based on the 1.5% coupon that is being charged for the NAMA bonds.Where are the Government's projections?  Where has it factored in the likelihood that interest rates will rise?  Everyone accepts that the ECB will start increasing interest rates in the middle of next year.  Where are the Government's projections in this document showing what will happen when ECB rates start rising, how much more those bonds will cost us and how many of the developer loans that are now performing will cease to perform?  Why are there no projections for that?  They are none because the Government knows if that happens NAMA fails and not only do we have to pay it all back in ten or 15 years, but NAMA will take a loss every year which we also have to pay for.We also have risk sharing.  We were promised by the Green Party, with the usual pomp from the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that we would have equal risk sharing.  Whatever equal is, it is not 5%.  Maybe he left out the zero, but 5% versus 95% is not equal risk sharing; it is just a fig leaf for the Green Party.Will NAMA get credit flowing to business, homeowners and people who want to buy?  I do not think it will because the mortgage books are also in trouble and there will be 17% unemployment, falling incomes and rising interest rates next year.  Businesses are going out of business and the business books are in trouble too.  The personal loan books are also in trouble.  Irish banks owe €100 billion to foreign banks.  They financed their lending for the past four years not from deposits but from the €100 billion they borrowed from foreign banks and institutions.  That must be paid back.They will also be obliged to rebuild their capital ratios.  A 4% or 5% tier 1 capital ratio will not be acceptable — it will have to be 8%, 9% or even 10%.  All the extra money the Government is giving to the banks will stay in them not because of badness but because, given those realities, they will not be able to lend money.  When it is clear that money is not flowing into the economy, in February, March or April next year we will come back to the idea of a national recovery bank, because the only way we will get money flowing into the economy is by setting up a new clean bank and not relying on giving €7 billion to the zombie banks and thinking it is enough for them to increase their capital ratios, write down all their losses on developer loans, cover their losses on mortgage and personal loans and deal with their foreign liabilities.What happened with foreign liabilities is amazing.  In 1995 the banks' foreign liabilities were approximately 10% of GDP.  In 2003 it was still 10% of GDP, but between 2003 and 2007 it went up to 50% of GDP.  That is the amount the Irish banks borrowed from overseas to lend into the Irish economy and whether we like it or not it all has to be paid back and a de-leveraging of €100 billion from the Irish economy will be painful and NAMA will not fix that problem.I have some questions which have not been addressed in any statements.  How long does the 1.5% coupon from the ECB last for, when does it start to rise and where are the Government's projections for it?  Regarding the breakdown of the haircut by each bank, we know how much in terms of loans the Government will buy from each bank but we do not know how much the write-downs are.  For all we know, the write-down for AIB or Bank of Ireland might only be 5% or 10%.  Meanwhile, the write-down for Anglo Irish Bank might be 60%.  If that is the case it puts a very different reflection on the Bill.  We do not know how long it will unwind over.  What has the ECB said to us about the repayment of the bonds?  Surely they are not perpetual.  At some point there will have to be some unwinding of the bonds and when will that be?The Minister kindly expressed his concern about people in negative equity, which includes people like me who bought in 2004, tens of thousands in my constituency and hundreds of thousands of people in my age group.  What is in this Bill to assist people who are in negative equity?  What is in it to assist people who are facing debt deflation for the first time since the 1930s, whereby a rising share of their falling income is being paid to the banks, the new landlords whom the Government want to bail out?  What does the Government have to say for them?  It has nothing to offer.Regarding associated loans, 36% of the loans referred to in the document are not land or development loans but are associate loans.  What are they?  Are they personal loans for developers?  Are they loans to finance their mansions and horses?  The largest section of loans the Government is buying is associated loans, then land and developments and I want to know more about them.I would also like to know what proposals the Government has for staff in the banks.  The banking sector will shrink and there will be redundancies.  What provisions will the Government make to ensure they are done fairly and the workers are properly compensated and looked after?We had a very good performance today from the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  He is a very good barrister who is very well trained at making a very bad case seem good and he did that well today, but it does not change the fact that this is based on sand.  As most people in the Chamber will know I am a capitalist and I believe in capitalism, the free market and enterprise.  It is the best way to generate wealth and it is then the job of Government to ensure it is spread fairly.  However, I do not believe in capitalists any more because they seem to want socialism for themselves.  When they start up they want subsidies, when they are making profits they want to be protected and when they fail they want to be bailed out.  That is what this is.  It is socialism for the super rich.As politicians we need to defend capitalism against the capitalists.  That is the key question which comes before us today.  This is NAMA, it does not protect the taxpayer and does not get credit flowing to businesses or homeowners.  It merely saves the banks from nationalisation.  It must be asked if it is really worth just that.

It is important to look at the record of the Minister for Finance on initiatives he has taken in banking.  One such initiative is the guarantee that was given.  We know up to now more than €1 billion has accrued in fees to the State as a result of it.  The situation regarding bank recapitalisation is far better.  The figures given in the NAMA document were eye-opening and it was the first time many of us got such inside information on the finances of Bank of Ireland and AlB.The market capitalisation of AIB today at 5.30 p.m. was €2.3 billion and the share price was €2.63.  When the Minister for Finance took up the redeemable convertible preference shares along with the warrants of 8%, there was an option to convert those shares into 25% of the issued capital.  If one took AIB and Bank of Ireland on the basis of their share prices today, there would be a profit of €1.3 billion just from converting preference shares into equity.  Along with that, the Minister is getting 8% of a coupon.  The recapitalisation was a significant investment and a very good deal.Deputy Varadkar mentioned the 1.5% coupon, asked how long it would last and when it would be unwound.  The banks will get a significant amount of money——

The amount drawn down under those headings in both banks is substantially less than what they have available at this point in time, without the availability of cheap money.  When the 1.5% coupon becomes available the banks should, in order to continue in business, be chasing loans of all descriptions.  Those who this year could not get a loan for a car, washing machine or furniture will see the banks going hand over fist to give out such loans.  We all know that savings are at a record high.  Consumer confidence and spending are needed.  This proposal will bring about significant confidence among everyone in Ireland, particularly consumers.  It will also lead to significant spending which will result in more employment, more activity within the economy, more taxation and an improvement in the budget figure, which is the bottom line.The haircut that will apply to AIB will account for €7.2 billion of the €24 billion total.  According to the bank, it has made provision for €2.2 billion.  Therefore, there is a shortfall of €5 billion in its provision.  Its core tier 1 capital is approximately €10 billion or €11 billion.  As €5 billion can be taken from that figure as a result of NAMA, further private or Government capital will be needed by the bank.  I hope the private capital people will come in and avail of the opportunity available.  There is market capitalisation of €2.2 billion for the whole bank.  As it will be difficult to secure the remaining €5 billion, the Government will have to go in again.  I hope it will be able to do as good a job as it did with the recapitalisation deal and that the interests of the taxpayer will be well looked after.

The most recent NES was published in July 2009 and uses data collected for October 2007 as its reference point.The National Minimum Wage rate in operation in October 2007 was €8.65 per hour. An estimated 83,800 employees were paid that amount or less, equivalent to 4.9% of all employees. There were an estimated 33,800 males and 50,000 females paid the National Minimum Wage rate or less.  Of the 83,800 estimated employees paid the National Minimum Wage rate or less, 46,300 were under 25 years of age while 37,500 employees were 25 years or older.More recent information on employees and the National Minimum Wage is available from the quarterly Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey (EHECS) but only for the Industrial and Financial Intermediation sectors. The data for Q1 2009 shows that there were approximately 2,800 employees in the industrial sector (or 1.3% of all employees in Industry) who were in receipt of €8.65 or less, while there were estimated to be less than 50 employees in the financial sector (or 0.1% of all employees in the sector).

This engagement leads to periodic agreements based on a shared analysis of the needs of the economy and society, and a set of shared objectives, such as those contained in Towards 2016.The engagement between the Government and the Opposition Parties takes place in the context of the framework of democratic accountability, under which the Government is accountable to the Oireachtas. In this context, the Government is accountable for its management of, and interaction with, the Social Partnership process.  Implementation of commitments included in Social Partnership agreements which involve legislative or Exchequer commitments are subject to the same democratic process through the Oireachtas as all other Government proposals, while debate on relevant issues takes place regularly in both Houses and in Oireachtas Committees. The Opposition's engagement with Social Partnership can be developed through these established mechanisms. There is no proposal, therefore, to establish a pillar of Social Partnership to represent the Opposition Parties.

The Council meets in different formats, in plenary format twice yearly, in sectoral format on a regular and frequent basis and in institutional format to consider institutional or cross sectoral matters.There are six implementation bodies:Waterways Ireland, Food Safety Promotion Board,  Trade and Business Development Body (Inter TradeIreland), The Language Body/An Foras Teanga/North-South Body (consisting of two agencies i.e. Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch) Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission (consisting of two Agencies i.e. The Loughs Agency and Lights Agency). Each of the Bodies operates on an all-island basis. While having a clear operational remit, all operate under the overall policy direction of the North South Ministerial Council, with clear accountability lines back to the Council and to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  There are six areas of cooperation dealing with aspects of Agriculture, Education, Environment, Health, Tourism, including Tourism Ireland and Transport. In each case, common policies and approaches are agreed in the North South Ministerial Council but implemented separately in each jurisdiction.The St Andrews Agreement provided for a Review of the North South Implementation Bodies and Areas for Co-operation. The Review is examining the efficiency and value for money of existing Implementation Bodies, the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC where mutual benefit would be derived, and providing input into the work on the identification of a suitable substitute for the proposed Lights Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  Progress under Strand II of the Good Friday Agreement is considered on a regular basis at Plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.  I have answered questions in this House on the outcome of the meetings in Derry on 23 January last and the most recent meeting on 6 July in Farmleigh House in Dublin.At recent Plenary meetings we have had very useful discussions on the economic challenges facing all parts of this island and we have considered progress on North/South Co-operation in areas such as health, education, transport and tourism.  In July we noted the following items:our re-affirmed commitment to the A5 and A8 road projects in the North and agreement to make a contribution of €9m to these before the end of the year.close co-operation on the Influenza A/H1N1 outbreak;agreement on a framework for the removal of waste illegally dumped in Northern Ireland;progress on introducing the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications;intensified co-operation on Child Protection;progress on suicide prevention;continued co-operation in education on the approaches to the integration of newcomer children in schools;the further development of the www.borderpeople.info website.The Council also noted that the St Andrew's Review Group is continuing its consideration of the report of the experts/advisers on efficiency and value for money of the existing Implementation Bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited. It confirmed its intention to conclude the St Andrews Review process before the end of 2009 and it instructed the Review Group to accelerate its work on all the elements of the Review and to provide a final report to the next meeting of the Plenary.The Council also noted the Executive's ongoing review of the Civic Forum. Following the conclusion of the Government's consultations with social partners and other groups from civic society in 2008, the Government forwarded proposals for the establishment of the Forum to the Northern Executive.  At the NSMC meeting, it was noted that the Government intends to hold a conference in Autumn 2009 involving social partners and other groups in civil society who have an interest in North/South co-operation. The Conference will take place on 15 October next.The establishment of a North South Parliamentary Forum is, of course, a matter for the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  At the NSMC plenary meeting we welcomed the establishment of two working groups, by the Oireachtas and the Northern Assembly respectively, to progress discussions on the establishment of a North South Parliamentary Forum. Progress will be reviewed at the next NSMC Plenary.  In addition to the Plenary meetings there have been 26 sectoral meetings under the NSMC since May 2008 and one meeting in Institutional format which took place last April.  The next NSMC plenary meeting will take place before the end of the year and I look forward to making further progress on the North/South agenda.

The purpose of the scheme is to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs and thereby:Help the economy retain its productive capacity and employers retain the labour, knowledge and skills of the workforce thereby supporting a faster return to sustainable growth;Help employees retain their jobs, andEnsure that economic and fiscal stability is promoted by avoiding the cost of statutory redundancy payments and the longer-term cost of social welfare.The total potential cost of the Scheme is €250 million of which up to €60 million may be released in 2009.  The Scheme provides a subsidy of €9,100 per employee over a 15-month period. The Scheme aims to support up to 27,400 jobs. The scheme applies to vulnerable but viable companies in the manufacturing or internationally traded service sectors. It involves the payment of a subsidy to firms on condition that they retain an agreed number of jobs. The scheme is managed by Enterprise Ireland and the closing date for applications wasthe 4th September 2009.  These applications are currently being considered by Enterprise Ireland.

In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland is concentrating its efforts in the County on the Gateway City of Waterford and the town of Dungarvan.  The County has a long and strong track record as a centre of manufacturing expertise. It has a key strength in engineering both in indigenous and overseas industry.  In more recent years however, the focus has been on attracting newer and more advanced manufacturing, particularly in the Life Sciences Sector and in the area of International & Financial Services activities.At present there are thirty one IDA Ireland supported companies in Waterford City and County employing approximately 5,960 people. In addition to marketing the County for new inward investment, the agency is also actively engaged with its existing clients to encourage their transition to higher value activities and to promote further investment in Ireland.  In the area of providing tailored property solutions to meet the needs of existing and prospective clients, the agency has developed the Waterford Business & Technology Park and the Dungarvan Business Park.  In addition, it has developed a large scale Greenfield site in Belview, specifically targeted to larger scale utility intensive overseas investments.  A further site on the Kilmeaden Road in Waterford City is also available for Greenfield investment.In parallel with developments on the property side, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with Third Level Educational Institutions in the South East Region so that the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the County are being developed. The agency also works with the Training and Employment agency FÁS to ensure that the requirements of industry, particularly in the area of training and up-skilling, are being met.Enterprise Ireland provides a rapid incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business. As part of Enterprise Ireland's South East Regional Strategy, the South-East Enterprise Platform Programme is underway at the Waterford Institute of Technology with sixteen participants to date in the current Programme. As part of the ongoing drive to promote entrepreneurship in the region, Enterprise Ireland has also run a series of Enterprise START workshops to encourage potential entrepreneurs to explore their business ideas. A total of forty nine participants from Waterford have taken part in the workshops held in 2009.The development of Community Enterprise Centres is a crucial part of EI's drive to create new regional enterprise.  The agency approved funding in 2008 of €450,000 towards a new Centre in the Ballybeg area and the Cappoquin Enterprise Centre was approved a grant of €50,000 for a Manager.  The annual South East Enterprise Week, which showcases successful entrepreneurs and encourages and assists current and potential entrepreneurs, will take place from  12 to 17 October this year.  Throughout the South East, events will take place to promote and encourage entrepreneurship.  Local Enterprise Ireland staff are closely involved in the initiative through the Spirit of Enterprise Regional Forum.Waterford City Enterprise Board held a number of information days for the staff of Waterford Crystal, offering potential entrepreneurs the opportunity to engage and discuss the different facilities available from the CEB. The CEB has since assisted a number of employees to set up their own businesses through the provision of financial assistance and the appointment of a Mentor to assist with the development of those business plans.The Board has refocused its training programmes to assist businesses to maintain growth and employment through the present economic crisis. Topics covered include Sales Training, Getting Paid / Controlling your Cash Flow and Overhead Cost Savings. A "Fresh Start 2009" Seminar was held on 11 September to showcase what supports are available from local agencies and organizations when exploring the idea of setting up a business. Following on from this seminar, the CEB hopes to provide a Business Idea Generation Programme for those wishing to pursue a career in entrepreneurship but may not have a clear business objective.The Board also intends to hold a series of Business Information Clinics as well as a number of lunch-time seminars covering such topics as Marketing on a Shoe-string, Basic Book Keeping, Managing your Business Costs and Open Source Software. The Board has joined with the Business Department of Waterford Institute of Technology to hold a number of seminars on looking at self-employment as an option for future graduates.  Waterford County Enterprise Board is currently working on a marketing programme with the tourism sector to increase visitor numbers and cultivate the industry in Co. Waterford. The Board is also working with Waterford IT in an attempt to revitalise the glass industry in the Region.I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being pursued by the Industrial Development agencies and the CEBs will continue to bring about industrial development and employment opportunities for Waterford City and Dungarvan.

I am informed by the IDA that there are 6 units in Waterford City and County on which the agency has long term lease agreements, and which are currently available for use.  The amount due on the balance of the leases of these 6 properties is €1,545,096.  However, it is anticipated that a number of these properties will be occupied or redeveloped during that period, which has the potential to reduce this liability.  It is a critical part of IDA Ireland's strategy that a portfolio of buildings be continuously available for its clients and those of Enterprise Ireland.

My understanding is that the lump sum applications for the former employees of Irish Dresden are currently being processed, and payment is expected within the next two weeks.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The number of persons signing on to the live register in the Tallaght region as at end August 2009, stands at 10,121, an increase of 87% over the last twelve months, the number of people under 25 years of age signing on in Tallaght was 2,563 in August 2009 an 85% increase from August 2008. This reflects the national trend over that period as the economic crisis has taken hold. (Live Register up nationally by 192,672 or 77.9% in the last 12 months).In response to the increase in unemployment my Department through FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, is prioritising on a national basis, the need to assist and up-skill those who have become unemployed. While activation measures will assist individuals in securing employment and enhancing their skills, the key to addressing our unemployment problem is the creation of more jobs. My Department remains strongly focussed on supporting and promoting enterprise development to create new jobs.  In this regard the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are working to ensure that we continue to grow the economy and jobs even in the current more challenging climate.FÁS Employment Services in Tallaght has recently undertaken one of the biggest direct marketing operations in the history of Tallaght, in conjunction with the Local Employment Service and the FÁS Training Centre.  This operation directly targeted people signing on in the Local Department of Social & Family Affairs office in Tallaght by giving them information and an invitation to come into the Training Centre for a briefing on all the available courses. The first of these briefings was completed on 9th September 2009, and will continue each Wednesday in September 2009.FÁS Employment Services also hosted the first pilot programme in the country to support the many Managers and Executives in Tallaght who have been made redundant. This Executive Networking and Support Programme was very successful with a 45% placement rate. FÁS Employment Services is also promoting the new Work Placement Programme in the area, with many employers beginning to avail of this programme.  FÁS Employment Services is also working in collaboration with colleagues in Northern Ireland in placing many of the local youth from Tallaght in the Wider Horizons/ Springboard programme. There are approx 70 participants in these projects from Tallaght annually. The programme covers Media, Child Care, Leisure Industry, Performing Arts, Options etc. As part of the programme, participants gain training and work experience placement abroad in London, South Africa, Montreal and Canada.FÁS is also enlisting the support of the local people in Tallaght to ascertain why only 60% of Tallaght people turn up for the courses offered to them.  This is a major issue with the amount of time and finances wasted by this large attrition rate. By year end, FÁS Employment Services will have placed approximately 5000 clients in Tallaght on training courses despite the large attrition rate.  Over the past 5 years, IDA Ireland has promoted Tallaght and South County Dublin as being well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grange Castle, and a third level Institute of Technology at Tallaght.In Grange Castle, planning permission has been approved for an Advance Integrated Circuit Manufacturing and Research facility. In November 2008, Microsoft Corporation announced, that it had selected Grange Castle as the location for its new European data centre.  Microsoft plans to invest $500m in the construction of the data centre and will employ up to 75 people. In addition, in July of this year Takeda had the official opening of its pharmaceutical plant in Grange Castle.  This facility already employs 40 of the 60 people planned for recruitment.  This facility will manufacture Takeda's blockbuster type II diabetes drug Actos. The development and manufacture of Takeda's future pipeline products for clinical trials will also take place at Grange Castle. These developments will be an invaluable tool for the future marketing of Grange Castle as a potential source of high quality and large-scale employment for the population of the environs, including Tallaght.Enterprise Ireland's activity in Tallaght is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies and by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up Companies.  Enterprise Ireland works closely with the Tallaght Institute of Technology in encouraging the commercialisation of research and has approved financial support of over €2.6m to the Institute for the development and management of a Campus based Incubation Centre. This centre provides entrepreneurs with affordable space in an environment which provides support to them to research their new ideas and to afford them the opportunity to bring about new indigenous businesses. The agency has also approved support of €1.225m for a Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Technology Tallaght, the focus of which is Microsensors for Clinical Analysis.

The Government is aware of the difficulty of providing suitable opportunities for young people in the current downturn.  A number of measures have been developed to tackle the problem of the rise in youth unemployment. These include the following:FÁS has more than doubled the number of training and work experience activation courses from 66,000 in 2008 to over 130,000.Through the National Employment Action Plan preventive strategy, just over 5,600 clients, who crossed the three-month unemployment thresholds and who were aged 18 to 24 years, were interviewed by FÁS between January and June 2009. Either half left the Live Register or were referred to a FÁS programme.In circumstances where there is not an immediate job available, the client will be referred to the ‘Youth into Workforce' programme.Through the Local Training OptionsinFÁS almost 1,000 Early School Leavers have started FÁS Training and Employment Programmes in the year to June 2009.FÁS is developing a Youth Framework outlining the services FÁS can offer to early school-leavers.To support apprentices to complete their apprenticeship, the Government has introduced The Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme which provides for the on-the-job training for redundant apprentices with employers who have released their own employed apprentices for off-the-job training.ESB has agreed to recruit 400 redundant electrical apprentices to allow them to complete their on-the-job training and assessments.Institutes of Technology are providing 700 places per annum on an 11-week certified training programme for apprentices.More generally, a number of new training programmes for those who have lost their jobs in the construction sector have been introduced by FÁS.The Government introduced a Work Placement Programme in June of this year for 2,000 unemployed, with half of the scheme earmarked for graduates who have been unemployed for six months or more, while 25% of the remaining places are earmarked for persons under the age of 25.As part of its ongoing review of labour market policy, it is intended that officials will engage in a consultation process with key stakeholders on the priorities for unemployment policy in the near future.

This compares to the 66,000 equivalent places that were delivered in 2008.  The breakdown of the 16,525 training and work experience activation places announced in the April 2009 Budget includes the following:An additional 13,848 training places which have been incorporated into the overall total of 92,000 FÁS training places available for 2009. Currently, FÁS is on target to meet this overall total, including the additional training places.Three hundred and twelve (312) of the 400 additional places, allocated to Community Employment have been filled to date, with the remaining 88 places being filled in the coming weeks.  This will bring the number of places overall on Community Employment to 22,780 when the extra 400 places have been filled.2,000 places have been created on the new Work Placement Programme, which is providing six-month places to individuals who are unemployed including graduates.Under the Short-Time Workers Training Programme277 workers who are on a 3-day week and receiving social welfare payments for the 2 days they are not working will receive training for these days.

Currently the statutory entitlement for eligible employees amounts to two weeks pay per year of service plus a bonus week subject to a ceiling of €600 per week. The primary function my Department has in this area, is to ensure that all eligible employees receive their statutory entitlements either from the employer where solvent or directly in cases of insolvency.The information available to my Department indicates that a redundancy rebate application was made by the former employer on 26 June of this year. This application was based on the submission of signed documentation from the employer which indicates that payment of statutory redundancy was made to the employee in question by the former employer on 25 June 2009.  It is, therefore, unclear as to what further payment is sought in this case.  Payment of the rebate to the former employer is being assessed at present.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 to 198, inclusive, and 222 together.In February, 2009, I established the Mid-West Task Force, chaired by Mr Denis Brosnan.  I received the Task Force's interim Report in July, which contained a wide range of recommendations. As many of these come within the remit of fellow Government colleagues, I am currently in the process of seeking their views on the recommendations.  In the meantime, of course, the Government has been responding to the economic downturn generally and has taken numerous initiatives, for example in relation to competitiveness, employment activation measures and the EU globalization fund in relation to individual companies, all of which have particularly benefited regions affected by job losses, including the Mid West region.  As regards the final report of the Task Force, Mr. Brosnan indicated previously that this would take some 18 months from February, 2009.Since the job losses announcement by Dell last January, all of the State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department, have come together and intensified their efforts and activities to support Dell and other workers being made redundant in the region.  In the case of IDA, its strategy is to re-position the Mid-West as a centre for knowledge based industry, while focusing on marketing the Limerick/Shannon Gateway as a key location for investment, by building on the strengths already evident in the region. IDA also cooperates with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as R&D, customer support and back office functions.  For example, 8 projects with a job potential of 1,073 were announced by multinational companies in the Mid West in 2008 and the beginning of 2009.Shannon Development has intensified its engagement with its Shannon Free Zone clients and, along with the other State development agencies, is actively promoting a range of support measures announced by Government to assist companies who are experiencing trading difficulties at this time.EI is working collaboratively with other state agencies in providing information and support to those facing redundancy. Túsnua was set up in late 2008 to alleviate the pending impact of lay-offs announced by a number of major employers in the Shannon region, which would take effect in early 2009.  Túsnua has hosted a number of information events in the region with over 1,500 attendees to date.  EI and the Limerick County Enterprise Board have run a series of workshops in house in Dell and are in constant contact with the company, so as to respond quickly to requests for programmes/meetings etc., with anyone wishing to start a business.As at the end of August 2009, FÁS Employment Services has engaged on a one-to-one basis with a total of 900 staff that have exited the Dell facility through redundancy since May 2009.  FÁS has provided intensive on site guidance and information service to the affected workers, with the primary aim of securing other employment, training or further education.  In order to meet the substantial additional costs of the measures described above and other costs, my Department has submitted an application to the European Commission, under the EU Globalisation Fund, for support in the provision of labour market services to redundant workers from Dell and downstream companies.

The action plan has been developed by FÁS for implementing recommendations contained in a recent review of the Supported Employment Programme.  Overarching stakeholder consultations are being managed under the Department's Consultative Forum on an employment strategy for people with disabilities.  It is hoped that agreement of the various stakeholders can be achieved as soon as possible on a number of issues relating to the action plan, including a definition relating to all eligibility criteria for entry to the service, with a view to undertaking a national launch as soon as possible of a re-branded and more efficient supported employment service for people with disabilities.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	562	In late 2003 the National Implementation Body (NIB), which comprises representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, IBEC/CIF and ICTU, commissioned Mr. Phil Flynn and Mr. Tom Mallon to examine the reasons for the pattern of industrial relations difficulties in the bricklaying sector of the construction industry.  The Report was delivered to the NIB in October 2006 and made available to the parties directly involved. The Report contained recommendations that the authors considered, if implemented, to be likely to result in a restoration of ‘normality' to industrial relations in the sector.  The authors noted moreover that there seemed to have been a decrease in the frequency of disputes since the Report had been commissioned.The recommendations in the Report were largely addressed to the parties concerned and were regarded as a package, to be accepted in full by the employers' and workers' representatives.  I understand that while the Construction Industry Federation accepted the Report, the Building and Allied Trades' Union could not accept it in full.Many of the issues identified in the Report were, in parallel, pursued by Government with the social partners as part of a range of employment rights measures that were subsequently agreed within the framework of the Towards 2016 and subsequent Review and Transitional Agreements. These have been reflected in the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority, and in enhanced liaison between NERA's operations and the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The maintenance of employment standards in the construction sector has also been advanced through the revised contractual conditions that apply under the new Forms of Construction Contracts for Public Works. The Towards 2016 Transitional Agreement also provided for a number of legislative commitments in this area to which the Government has responded in particular through the introduction of the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which are aimed at strengthening protections for employment standards.

CE helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills. To facilitate some short-term employment opportunities, breaks off the live register up to 30 days in total are permissible within the 12-month eligibility period, while still maintaining eligibility for CE.The reason for the 30-day live register break rule is to ensure that the programme responds to its primary target group of long term unemployed clients. Many unemployed people engage in work of a temporary nature. If the programme were open to these individuals, there is a danger that people would leave their employment, albeit of a temporary nature, in order to participate in Community Employment. This would be contrary to the objective of the programme and result in a Labour Market Intervention competing with the open labour market. In circumstances where breaks off the live register exceed 30 days, other interventions may be more appropriate than CE in these instances.CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.

Travelling and subsistence allowances, at the rate and subject to the regulations appropriate to Civil Servants, are payable in respect of necessary travel undertaken in connection with the board members duties.The Chief Executive of IAASA, who is a seconded civil servant, is, in accordance with the terms of Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act, 2003, a member of the Board of directors. The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies provides that, where a State Body's Chief Executive is also a Board member, the post holder may be paid an annual director's fee at the rate approved by the Minister from time to time. Ministerial approval has been granted in this respect. The current rate payable is €8,100 per annum.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department received a statutory lump sum application from the individual concerned on 11 May 2009.  When an employer claims inability to pay, the onus is on the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim.  In this case further information had to be requested from the employer to allow a decision to be reached.  This has caused a further delay in paying the applicant, in addition to the delays being experienced arising from the unprecedented high volume of claims on hand.  However, the required information has been received and the claim is now being processed, and  payment should be made within two weeks.

Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of Feasibility, Employment and Capital Grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of micro-enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which, over time, may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to assist enterprises to develop their growth potential.Anyone who wishes to start their own business should in the first instance contact their local County Enterprise Board (details of all Boards are available on www.enterpriseboards.ie) to seek appropriate advice.

The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by Minister Micheál Martin no new entrants have been admitted onto the Job Initiative Schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed allowing them the option to continue until they are 65 years of age.  The 2009 budget for the Job Initiative is €39 million and there are currently 1,444 participants with this number decreasing annually due to retirement and other reasons.

The situation is set out in my reply today to a separate question from Deputy Sherlock.In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA is actively marketing Fermoy as part of the broader North Cork region, which includes the towns of Mallow, Mitchelstown, Fermoy, Kanturk, Charleville, Newmarket and Millstreet.  IDA strives to attract companies from across the full range of IDA targeted sectors, such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and Internationally Traded Services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions.  In addition the Agency continues to work closely with its existing clients in the area to encourage the expansion of their operations.However, in the final analysis it is the investor who decides where to visit and where to locate.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio, including the creation and marketing of business parks, are day-to-day operational matters for the agency as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas and not matters in which I have a function.I understand from IDA Ireland that it has approximately six hectares available on the Fermoy Business and Technology Park.  To date the Agency has undertaken a number of initiatives to develop and market the lands.  IDA Ireland has carried out master planning of the park, landscaped the entrance area and submitted and received planning permission for an advanced technology unit.  This pre-planning work could potentially encourage a prospective investor to the park.  IDA also provides property solutions to Enterprise Ireland Clients, and in this connection the Agency has completed a land sale to an indigenous company.  I understand, however, that the company in question has not yet proceeded with their plans to build on the park.  IDA continues to promote the park via its overseas offices and in response to queries from prospective investors.  I understand that at present IDA is engaged with a prospective investor who has visited the park and has expressed interest in acquiring a site on the park.  I hope that this and other proposals can lead to employment gains in Fermoy.  A meeting can be arranged at the appropriate time.  To date there has been no request from the Council.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 216, inclusive, and 218 together.I am not familiar with the article mentioned by the Deputy but I would like to assure him that Ireland, along with EU partners, regards all Israeli settlements in either the West Bank or East Jerusalem as illegal under international law and accordingly any goods produced in those settlements clearly should not benefit from any preferential trade arrangements between the EU and Israel.Trade relations between the EU and Israel are currently governed by the EU-Israel Association Agreement.  This provides preferential customs status for certain goods traded between the EU and Israel.  Consequently, some companies operating in Israel may benefit from exemptions from, or reductions of, import tax or duties when exporting to the EU.  Goods exported to the EU from illegal Israeli settlements cannot benefit from these preferential arrangements.  In order to ensure that products from these settlements do not benefit from preferential treatment and exemptions, exports to the EU from Israel are subject to proof of origin requirements.  This requirement enables customs authorities in each EU member state to identify goods from Israeli settlements and to apply the relevant import duties.As the competent Irish authority, the Revenue Commissioners Customs Service implement rules of origin controls on imports of goods into Ireland from Israel and Israeli settlements and apply the appropriate tariff duties.  The official import data that is collated by the Central Statistics Office, lists the value of imports by reference to the country of origin and also the main categories of commodities involved for each country as a whole.  Breakdowns by individual exporting companies or by areas/towns within the relevant country, are not compiled.  Accordingly it is not possible to provide the detailed information sought by the Deputy in this case.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners however, that, in the limited time available and based on an initial examination of their records, they have identified total imports from Israel to the value of €71,658,555 in the period from 1 October 2008 to date but it has not been possible to arrive at a definitive statement of the total duty collected in these cases.  Within the aforementioned amount, entitlement to preferential duty was claimed in respect of goods to the value of €31,400,605.  It is not possible to state with any certainty the reasons why the remaining goods would not have qualified for preference.

Specifically the Act provides that the provision of false information in relation to the geographical or commercial origin of a product and where that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make, that such a practice is a misleading commercial practice.  Traders who engage in misleading commercial practices commit an offence and are liable on conviction on indictment or on summary conviction, as the case may be, to the fines and penalties provided for under the Act.  Evidence of traders engaging in misleading commercial practices should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency, which is the body responsible for the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.

The LTI provides alternative early training interventions for socially excluded clients and is designed to reach out to niche marginalised groups and provide individually based training tailored to meet locally identified needs.There is a wide range of activation measures both aimed specifically at redundant apprentices such as the Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme and the provision of 700 places annually at Institutes of Technology for redundant apprentices, and more generally at the unemployed which the Government has implemented or deepened since the April budget.Activation measures aimed at assisting the unemployed back to work or to retaining vulnerable jobs include over 130,000 training and work experience places funded by my Department through FÁS including 22,700 Community Employment places, a Work Placement programme, a Short-Time Workers training programme and an Employment Subsidy Scheme (Temporary).  Moreover, additional activation oriented measures are being funded by the Department of Education and Science to provide significant numbers of part-time third level courses for the unemployed or those on short time working.  Full details of all relevant measures have been given to the House previously.

The bicycles and equipment are paid for by way of salary sacrifice by those acquiring the bicycles.  There would be minor costs in processing forms and in carrying the up-front costs until such time as those are offset by the gradual deductions from salary.  Neither of these is quantifiable.  The only material cost of the scheme to the State is the exemption from income tax, PRSI or levies on that part of an employee's salary foregone in the purchasing of a bicycle and bicycle safety equipment under the scheme.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I am aware that there has been an increase in insurance premiums this year.  This increase however has to be considered against a backdrop of the continuing stress in the financial markets and the recessionary pressures in the economy which is affecting all financial service providers including the insurance industry.  My Department has been advised by the Financial Regulator that while the non-life insurance market performed well up to the end of 2006, market sources indicate that much non-life business was written at a loss in 2007.  This trend continued in 2008, but the companies were still willing to write business at a loss in order to maintain their market share.  They were able to do this as a result of the reserves they had built up during profitable years.  However, the situation could not go on indefinitely and indications are that firms are now taking action on pricing to underpin their financial positions.This position is supported by a report published earlier this year by Standard & Poor's titled ‘ A Testing 2009 for the Irish Non-Life Insurance Market, Despite Fundamental Strengths’.  It provides an insight into the problems facing the industry at the moment.  The report envisages a difficult year for the non-life industry as a result of rising claims and continuing intense competition which they say is limiting price increases.  They add that this combined with anticipated lower investment returns is expected to hinder profitability.In the current difficult trading climate, there is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the long-term sustainability of the insurance industry and at the same time making sure that the consumer obtains good value for money.  I am particularly conscious of the impact of a significant increase in premiums for both the consumer and business and it must be a priority for insurance companies to ensure that insurance cover is provided as competitively as possible consistent with long term commercial sustainability and viability.In conclusion, the recent upward trend in insurance prices reflects a range of factors outside the control of the industry.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate from a policy perspective to seek to intervene in the commercial conduct or decision making of insurance firms in the absence of clear evidence of market failure in respect of which there is scope to address from a national perspective.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230, 231, 240 and 243 together.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that the information requested by the Deputies is as follows.  Revenue's current strategy for tackling this illicit trade is focussed both on intercepting and seizing illicit consignments at the point of importation and also on carrying out checks at retail outlets, markets and commercial premises etc.Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of freight intelligence, risk profiling and scanning in the case of smuggling in maritime freight.  In the case of passengers arriving by air from high risk source countries where cheap cigarettes are available, targeting smugglers is carried out on the basis of risk profiling by Revenue Officers based at all the main airports. Where feasible, large consignments are placed under surveillance and allowed to proceed to their destination under a controlled delivery with a view to identifying those responsible for the importation.  These controlled delivery operations are normally carried out on a multi-agency basis with the assistance of the Garda.Illicit cigarettes that escape detection at the point of importation are also seized inland in the course of intelligence-based and random checks carried out at retail outlets, markets, commercial premises etc.  Follow-up investigations are also conducted with a view to identifying those responsible and instituting criminal proceedings where the necessary evidence has been obtained.Revenue's strategies in relation to detection of tobacco offences are under continuous review.  This includes the adequacy of existing staffing resources and equipment.  In this regard, taking cognisance of the interception and seizure of a number of consignments of counterfeit cigarettes bearing counterfeit Irish tax stamps concealed in maritime freight imported from China, it is planned to introduce a new tobacco tax stamp with added security features shortly.  In addition, the purchase of a second mobile container scanner has been approved, and this, when deployed, will increase Revenue's detection capability at ports.The tackling of cigarette smuggling on an EU wide basis is co-ordinated by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) which has established a special task force (entitled OLAF Task Group Cigarettes) for this purpose.  Revenue actively co-operates and shares information with this group and also with Customs Administrations in other Member States.  In addition, Ireland, along with the other Member States, has ratified two international agreements concluded by OLAF with global cigarette manufacturers Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International, with a view to tackling the illicit trade in counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.As regards the smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes from the Far East, the extent of the problem is evident from the fact that out of 90m cigarettes seized in maritime freight in 2008, 57m were counterfeit, while over 23m counterfeit cigarettes have been seized to date in 2009 out of a total of 30m detected in maritime freight.  China is currently the primary source of counterfeit cigarettes and Revenue has sought the assistance of OLAF's Liaison Officer based in Beijing with a view to tackling this problem at source by requesting the assistance of the Chinese Authorities.Revenue also works closely with the individual tobacco manufacturers and the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC) with a view to identifying illicit cigarettes on sale in the State as well as current trends and trading patterns.  There is close co-operation and sharing of information between Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control (OTC).  It is not possible to accurately determine the potential tax loss as a result of the illicit tobacco trade.  The figure of €387m quoted is equivalent to approximately 20% of the market and Revenue would tentatively accept this is an estimate of the amount of untaxed cigarettes consumed in Ireland.  However, it is important to note that such estimate includes legal cross-border shopping purchases for personal consumption and not only smuggled counterfeit and contraband cigarettes.Statistics in relation to seizures since 2006 are set out in the following table.

The Act has been amended in particular by the Finance Act 1998 and the Finance Act 2007.  The 1998 changes extended the opening hours of betting shops to cater for the growing trend towards evening race meetings and Sunday racing.  The 2007 changes extended the opening times of betting shops up to 10.00 p.m. during the ‘winter period' on evenings when a race-meeting is scheduled at an authorised racecourse.The current legislation covering opening hours of betting shops in summary sets out that:registered premises cannot be open for business on Christmas Day, Good Friday or Easter Sunday,from 1 April to 31 August in any year, registered premises cannot open before 7.00 a.m. or after 10.00 p.m., andfrom 1 September to 31 March in any year, registered premises cannot open before 7.00 a.m. or after 6.30 p.m., unless a race-meeting at an authorised racecourse is taking place on or after 6.30 p.m.  On days on which such a race-meeting is taking place, registered premises can remain open for business until 10.00 p.m.While a range of issues including revenue yield, employment and social concerns, would be taken into account in considering any changes to the opening hours for betting shops, I have no plans at present to change the current permissible opening hours.

The provision of funding in relation to remedial works for such infrastructure would be a matter for the Department of Transport.  The role of the OPW is to work with Mayo County Council to reduce the risk of further flooding.  In this regard, the OPW recently wrote to local authorities setting out criteria that the OPW will use to judge the merits of requests for funding for small scale flood alleviation works and studies, to be undertaken by local authorities to address localised flood problems, particularly where a mix of homes, businesses and infrastructure is involved.The local authorities were requested by the OPW to identify and prioritise such works in their administrative areas.  It would be open to Mayo County Council to consider submitting an application in respect of the particular areas referred to by the Deputy in his Parliamentary Question, provided the works proposed by the Council meet the specified criteria, and provided the Council is satisfied that they also are of sufficient priority to warrant consideration for funding.  Any request received by the OPW from the Local Authorities will be given full consideration, having regard to overall resources availability.

Aggregate income includes lump sums, both bonus payments and retirement lump sums.  In the case of retirement lump sums only that part of the lump sum which is liable to income tax is subject to the income levy.The supplementary budget increased the rates of income levy. These increased rates apply to a person's aggregate income for the year 2009 as a whole. However, in recognition of the fact that persons who were in receipt of termination lump sum payments in the period 1 January 2009 to 30 April 2009 had already paid income levy at the rates originally announced in the budget on 14 October 2008, the supplementary budget and subsequent Finance Act 2009 provided that the levy payable on such lump sums would remain unchanged.  If, however, the annualised increased rates of income levy give a more favourable result those affected may elect for the annualised rates to apply.  This treatment does not apply to bonus payments, or retirement lump sums paid on or after 1 May 2009.

At the meeting, the City Council tabled an Interim Report on the issue, carried out by the council's consultants.  The report found that the previously preferred local flood alleviation option, namely the construction of a duplicate Wad culvert , was not a viable option, as it would in fact increase the risk of flooding downstream in a built up area, closer to the Clontarf seafront.  The report concluded that a full study of the River Wad Catchment was required to establish the most appropriate measures to alleviate the flooding problem.I am advised that the City Council has commenced a procurement process to select a consultant to carry out the study.  The Consultant is expected to be appointed in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the Study expected to be completed within a further six months.  OPW will continue to work with the City Council on this matter and, in conjunction with the Council, will consider how best to implement any recommendations contained in the Study, when completed.

As a result, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for the Commissioners to comment on the tax affairs of any taxpayer at the request of another taxpayer, which appears to be the import of these questions.  By way of general remarks, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are fully familiar with the facts surrounding the transactions in question.

Following a detailed investigation by engineering staff it was found that there was no financial or engineering benefit to the flood protection scheme in return for constructing these works. It is considered that the construction of these penstocks/sluice gates would lead to a residual weakness in the flood protection scheme that would require additional maintenance and management on an ongoing basis in order to manage the risk of failure of these elements.  OPW engineering staff have reviewed the harbour and channel on the south of the island in order to mitigate the risk of damage to the features in question.

The scheme allows an exemption from income tax on rent received where a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence, and the rent received does not exceed €10,000 per year (€7,620 up to and including the 2007 tax year).  In order to qualify for the exemption, it is necessary for the residential premises to be situated in the State and occupied by the individual as his or her sole or main residence during the tax year.In 2007, the rent-a-room scheme was amended so that the exemption would not be available to parents who rent a room or rooms to one or more of their children.  In such cases, the parents will have to declare their rental income on their annual tax return, net of allowable expenses, and pay any income tax arising.  The rent-a-room scheme was introduced as an incentive to encourage individuals to let rooms in their principal private residence.  It was never envisaged that the scheme would cover the situation of children living with their parents in the family home.  The purpose of the 2007 amendment was to ensure that the exemption is only granted for the purpose for which it was originally intended.

In relation to the geographic distribution of investors, the NTMA advise that such information is only available in relation to bonds sold through syndicated issues.  Of the €27 billion raised, some €20 billion was raised through bond syndications.  The NTMA advise that syndications since August 2008 have seen approximately 30% distributed to banks covered by the bank guarantee scheme.As regards bonds sold through auctions, the remaining €7 billion was raised through bond auctions over the relevant period and the only information available relates to the level of participation in the auction by the NTMA's eleven primary dealers, ten of which are international banks.  I understand from the NTMA that the level of participation by each Primary Dealer is highly sensitive commercial information and is not disclosed.  The NTMA also advise that international investors hold 82% of all outstanding Irish Government bonds.  This is a high level by international standards and compares with 22% before the introduction of the euro.

I can confirm that this company does not have any contracts with my Department.  The position in respect of other Departments or Government agencies is a matter for the relevant Ministers.  The company referred to by the Deputy has been utilised by the Office of Public Works on a number of occasions in the past.  However, the Commissioners of Public Works have had no contracts with this company in the recent past, and have no knowledge of any contracts that currently exist between this company and the Office of Public Works or other Government Agencies.Under public procurement regulations contracting authorities are required to ensure that tenderers take account of the obligations relating to employment protection and working conditions that are in force and to disregard any tenderer that fails to comply with this requirement.  Standard contract conditions for public sector construction projects empower authorities to monitor compliance by contractors with laws relating to pay and working conditions.  In addition, contractors may be excluded from a public tendering process if they have been guilty of professional misconduct or have failed to make tax and social security payments required by law.

This means that the levy is applied to an individual's aggregate income from all sources in a year, that is, employment, self-employment, rental, investment and dividends.  For those with employment only income, which is paid regularity over the course of the year, the payroll deduction system should ensure that the right amount of levy for the year is deducted and paid over to the Revenue Commissioners without the need for any end of year review or claim by the taxpayer.To the extent that a person may have variations in the level or regularity of their employment income, or where a person has income from other sources in addition to wages and salaries, it will be necessary for that person to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for an end of year review, unless the person is subject to the self-assessment system in which case they will be required to pay Preliminary Tax by 31 October 2009 and submit a self-assessed tax return for 2009 by 31 October 2010.

I have already taken steps in relation to the revision of expenses.  I have generally reduced the Oireachtas expense allowances by 10% and by 25% in the case of mileage.  The Oireachtas Commission made proposals to me about the system of expense allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas.  The proposals were an attempt to provide a more streamlined expenses system involving a single composite allowance in place of the existing separate allowances.I have introduced enabling legislation which would allow the proposals of the Commission to be implemented.  The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009 provides for the introduction of a single composite allowance for Deputies and Senators to be known as the Parliamentary Standard Allowance.  However, I am of the view that there is a need for further consideration and discussion of the proposed composite allowance before it is introduced in any regulations.

These are direct levies paid by financial entities that are regulated by the Financial Regulator and a subvention from the Central Bank, which is provided from the Bank's own resources generated from its activities in the financial markets.  In 2009, it is estimated that the former funding source will raise approximately €34 million and the latter approximately €29 million for the Regulator.As the Deputy is aware, most of the functions carried out by the Financial Regulator will be integrated with the Central Bank's functions in the new Central Bank of Ireland Commission.  Accordingly, the new integrated organisation will be responsible for both the supervision of individual financial institutions and the stability of the financial system generally.  The financing by the industry of the regulatory functions of the new organisation will be considered in the context of the transfer of functions to the new Central Bank of Ireland Commission.

Details of the precise annual percentage rate (APR) permitted to be charged under a particular moneylender licence may be obtained by consulting the Moneylender Register .
Loans offered by moneylenders are a relatively expensive form of credit where the moneylending agreement is usually for a small loan borrowed over a short period.  Therefore, APRs charged by licensed moneylenders are, generally, much higher than those charged by lenders such as Banks, Building Societies and Credit Unions, who provide much larger loans for much longer periods.  A possible higher risk of default is a further consideration for the moneylender.Moneylenders are obliged to inform the Financial Regulator of the maximum APR they intend to charge to consumers.  It is printed on each moneylender licence and an APR above this may not be charged.  Inspections of moneylenders are carried out by the Financial Regulator in which moneylending agreements are examined to determine the APRs actually charged.  A licence application can be refused on the grounds that the Financial Regulator is of the opinion that the cost of credit charged is excessive.  There is no provision in the Consumer Credit Act with regard to the maximum APR that can be charged by moneylenders.The Deputy may wish to note that the Financial Regulator, in its March 2007A
Report on the Licensed Moneylending Industry in Ireland, concluded that the introduction of an interest rate ceiling for moneylenders may not achieve the objectives of lowering the cost of credit for consumers.  From late 2007 to late 2008, the Financial Regulator engaged with interested stakeholders (including Credit Union representatives) with a view to increasing transparency in relation to costs associated with loans from moneylenders.  This included its March 2008 Consultation Paper CP33.Chapter 1 of the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders Code, which came into effect on 1 January 2009, sets out ‘General Principles’ with which a moneylender must comply such as that it must act honestly and professionally, with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its consumers.The Code's remaining provisions, including ‘Common Rules for Moneylenders', are due to come into effect on 30 September 2009.  These set out requirements in relation to the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer's rights, knowing the consumer, suitability, unsolicited contact (cold calling), disclosure, errors, handling complaints, consumer records, unsolicited credit facilities, arrears and guarantees; and debt collection.  Among these is the requirement for the moneylender to assist a consumer in understanding the product provided, including the method of repayment, all related interest payments, charges and the cost per €100 borrowed.

The specific allowances payable in respect of Ministerial Office are described below.  Ministers are entitled to subsistence payments when they are absent from their headquarters and home on official business.  In general, expense allowances have been reduced by 10%.  However, mileage rates have been reduced by 25%.  Revised guidelines relating to foreign travel were issued by my Department on 1 July 2009.Subsistence is payable where a Minister is absent from his or her headquarters and home on official business in Ireland and abroad.  In Ireland Ministers may claim the vouched cost of a hotel room, including tax and up to 15% for service charges and a subsistence allowance of €72.66 per night.  The latter amount reflects a reduction of 25% from 5 March 2009 and is designed to provide for meals and a small amount for incidentals.  Where absent abroad on official business, Ministers may also claim the vouched cost of a hotel room including tax and up to 15% for service charges.  The subsistence rate payable varies from location to location.

Clare.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	610	As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax would come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of €10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.  The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009.  However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport.  This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate.  Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel.  Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand.  The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. shouldn't have much of an effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.  We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure.  I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.  I have no plans to review the air travel tax.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 264, 281, 293 and 294 together.I am aware that certain bookmakers are considering relocating their internet businesses from the UK, including to Gibraltar.  It is the prerogative of a company to locate its businesses where it sees fit.  In that regard, it should be noted that Ireland's tax regime, for example corporation tax, compares favourably to other countries.  In addition, Ireland has a highly skilled and flexible workforce.As I stated during the Finance Bill process, it has been my intention to widen if possible the tax base on which betting duty would be applied.  Bets placed either online or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty is therefore problematic.  My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area and will continue to do so, on an ongoing basis.In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has initiated a review in order to provide the Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing gambling architecture in the State.  The review, amongst other things, will consider:the recommendations contained in the Report Regulating Gaming in Ireland,the existing law regulating gaming lotteries and other forms of gambling in the jurisdiction,international developments, in particular the experience of the UK's Gambling Commission,developments in relation to remote gambling (e.g. via the internet and mobile phones).As the Deputies may be aware, due to pressure on the betting sector, I decided to defer the introduction of the increase in the betting duty provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 pending a review.  Accordingly, the Finance Act 2009 contains a provision for continuing the existing betting duty rate of 1% unless and until an order is made bringing the 2% rate into effect, or alternative betting  taxation arrangements are enacted.  This decision is based on the premise that the betting sector will engage in constructive discussions about putting in place a fair and workable tax base for the sector.  Such discussions will, inter alia, touch on issues such as online/phone betting, which is largely untaxed, and look at proposals that could potentially bring this area into the tax net, if possible, while also protecting Irish employment in the sector.In relation to the matter of the late payment of betting duty by bookmakers, betting duty is payable quarterly, by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter.  If betting duty is not paid when due, interest is payable on the amount outstanding, in accordance with section 74 of the Finance Act 2002 as amended by section 29(6) of the Finance Act 2009.  The current rate of interest, effective from 1 July 2009, is 0.0274 per cent per day.  It is a key goal of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that everybody complies with their tax responsibilities, and that any taxes due are paid in a timely way.  If a betting duty payment is not received by the due date, Revenue pursues the matter with the bookmaker concerned to ensure that payment is made as soon as possible.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I recognise the importance of public contracts as a source of business for SMEs and I am anxious to promote their participation to the greatest extent possible under EU law.  It is inevitable, of course, given present conditions in the construction sector, that there will be greater competition than formerly for places on tender lists and in tender contests.  My Department is in discussions with the EU Commission on the question of whether the use of random selection as a means of short listing works contractors would be permissible under EU procurement law.The open tendering procedure is widely used for civil engineering projects and under EU and national procurement rules, this procedure allows firms meeting the minimum suitability standards to tender for public sector work without any further short listing.  However, EU rules stipulate that contracting authorities have the right to use other tendering procedures, such as the restricted procedure, where they deem it appropriate to the circumstances of the particular project.

In relation to the recapitalised banks however, these operate at an arms' length basis and as such I do not have a role in the wage negotiating process of the banks.  I will be responding to the issues raised in the attached letter directly to the individuals concerned later this week.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	614	The Annual Report on the National Development Plan for 2007 has been published and sets out comprehensive information on expenditure and outputs under each Programme. The document is available on my Department's website at www.ndp.ie/docs/NDP_Annual_Report_2007/2135.htm.  Please see pages 135 to 145 of the Report.A total of €1.611 billion (€1.5 billion current and €110 million capital) was invested during 2007 under the nine sub-programmes within the Children's Programme and responsibility for these sub-programmes rests with the following Departments: Health and Children, specifically the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Health Service Executive; Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The next progress report on the NDP is due in 2010 and will cover the years 2008 and 2009.My colleagues, The Ministers for Health, Education and Justice can provide the Deputy with more detailed and up to date information on expenditure and outputs in 2008 and 2009 under the sub-programmes for which they are responsible.  All decisions on funding allocations for 2010 will be taken as part of the forthcoming Estimates process.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as part of a review of small offices, Revenue has assessed the need for full-time attendance at Killybegs, taking into account the level of demand for Revenue services at that location and modern service delivery channels.  It was found that the level of demand did not warrant full-time attendance.  Accordingly, the official who had been based in Killybegs until his recent retirement is not being replaced at that location.Revenue officials met with Killybegs-based traders to discuss how the work could be re-organised to meet their service requirements.  It has been agreed that service will be available to traders from the Revenue office in Donegal Town, which is only 25 kilometres from Killybegs.  A much larger pool of staff is available at Donegal Town to ensure continuity and consistency of service and to deliver a broader range of customer services from that location.  Full contact details, including contact names, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail addresses, have been given to the traders.  Where necessary, an officer from Donegal Town can attend at Killybegs by appointment if physical presence is needed for any particular transaction.  The level of service provided, as well as the methods of service delivery, will be kept under review.The Revenue Anti-Evasion Teams will continue to cover Killybegs Port as part of their ongoing patrols, while the Customs Cutter patrols the coastline.  The attendance of these enforcement personnel is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Patrols of the ports are kept under constant review to take account of available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	616	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue has, for a number of years, employed a drug detector dog handler in Sligo who is engaged full time on drugs detection activities, principally at the regional airports and the ports.  In line with best practice in Customs administrations worldwide, Customs enforcement activity is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators and can also be as a result of specific intelligence.It is not the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to publish exact details of enforcement activities as this could prejudice future operations.  However, during the period 1st January 2009 to 30th June 2009, over 250 flights into the regional airports in the west and north-west were targeted on a risk analysis basis.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	618	On 20 September 2008, I announced that the Government had decided to increase the compensation limit for the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in Ireland from €20,000 to €100,000 per depositor per institution.  The cover applies to 100% of each individual's aggregate deposits up to the prescribed limit per financial institution and also applies to deposits held in credit unions.  The Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 provided a statutory basis for the making of subsequent regulations (European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Regulations 2009) in order to give legal effect to this decision on deposit guarantee arrangements.  The Deposit Guarantee Scheme applies to all credit institutions authorised in this State.In addition there is a further guarantee called the Credit Institutions Financial Support Scheme which applies to the seven covered credit institutions (AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life & Permanent, Postbank, Irish Nationwide, and EBS).  As you are aware, the Scheme provides a State guarantee for all deposits and certain liabilities of the guaranteed institutions to the extent that these are not covered by existing deposit protection schemes in the State or any other jurisdiction.  In short, depositors must first claim from the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and then move on to claim any balance from the Credit Institutions Financial Support Scheme.The Credit Institutions Financial Support (CIFS) Scheme was put in place for a two year period from 30 September 2008 to 29 September 2010.  However, as I announced in my Supplementary Budget Statement on 7 April 2009, it is the Government's intention to put a State guarantee in place for the future issuance of debt securities with a maximum maturity of up to five years.  The enactment of the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act on 26 June 2009 has provided a power to extend the guarantee by order beyond its current expiry date of 29 September 2010.  In this regard, work is continuing on the drafting of a Scheme, the introduction of which requires EU State aid and Oireachtas approval.  Access to longer-term funding in line with the mainstream approach in the EU is expected to contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability.  The extended scheme must be approved in accordance with EU State aid rules and discussions are continuing in this regard with the European Commission.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	619	Following an increase of €50, from €250 to €300 per licence announced in Budget 2008, the excise duty for an off-licence was further increased to €500 in Budget 2009 in conjunction with an increase in the excise duty for a range of licences to manufacture or sell alcohol products.  The excise duty for such licences was increased to €500 as most of them had not been increased for a significant period, many not since 1992.  It is the general practice that excise duty on licences to trade are set at one rate and do not differentiate based on the volume or quantity of activity undertaken by the holder of the licence.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	620	On 25 February 2009, the European Commission provided guidance on the treatment of asset relief measures by Member States.  The Commission considers that a common European approach is presently needed to deal with the treatment of impaired assets to ensure banks resume their normal function of lending to the economy.  Guidelines were also issued by the European Central Bank on bank asset support measures.The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) initiative announced on 7 April, the details of which have been published in the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 that will be subject to a second stage debate today, has been developed within the common EU framework detailed in the European Commission Guidance and guidelines issued by the European Central Bank.  My officials are engaged in ongoing consultations with the European Commission to ensure that the design and the implementation of the NAMA proposal will be consistent with EU State aid requirements.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The new cutter as with the existing cutter will have a national remit, including the west coast of Ireland.  Either or both vessels can and will be deployed to patrol and carry out operations along that coastline as and when required.  The practice with the existing cutter is that deployments consist of a mixture of routine patrols and specific risk-driven taskings.  This practice will continue, enhanced by the increased capability of the Revenue Commissioners with two cutters.I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that sea trials are due to commence next week at the shipyard in Finland, where the second Revenue Cutter was built.  Following those trials and any necessary changes to the vessel, shipyard personnel are due to deliver the cutter to Ireland for handover to Revenue Customs in the last week of September.  The actual delivery date is dependent on the duration of the sea trials and weather conditions during the voyage from Finland to Ireland.  Allowing for a short period of time for crew familiarisation, it is expected that the cutter will come into full service in the second half of October.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  As medical appliances such as the Lokomat machine were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to the supply of such products.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  Annex III allows the provision of a reduced rate for the supply of medical equipment, aids and other appliances to alleviate or treat disability which is used for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person.  However this provision does not extend to the supply of medical equipment for the use of multiple persons, which is the intended use by Cois Ceim Eile of the Lokomat machine.  In this case the only rate that can apply to the Lokomat machine is the standard VAT rate of 21.5%.  However, there is an option open to Cois Ceim Eile to apply for a VAT Refund for the purchase of the Lokomat machine under the VAT refund scheme for certain donated medical instruments and appliances (SI 58/92).The main conditions relating to this refund scheme are that:the appliance or instrument is donated to a hospital;the appliance costs €25,390 or more in value (exclusive of tax);the appliance is designed and manufactured for use solely in medical research or in diagnosis, prevention or treatment of illness;the appliance is purchased through voluntary donations, such that no part of the funds used in the purchase is provided directly or indirectly by the State, a State body or any public or local authority, which includes lottery funding; and,the appliance is subject to a recommendation by the Minister for Health and Children that, having regard to the requirements of the health services in the State, a refund of tax would be appropriate.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  However, there is provision for the refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of a new medical instrument or appliance by a person who donates such equipment to a hospital.  The main conditions relating to this refund scheme are that:the appliance or instrument is new and is donated to a hospital;the appliance costs €25,390 or more in value (exclusive of VAT);the appliance is designed and manufactured for use solely in medical research or in diagnosis, prevention or treatment of illness;the appliance is purchased through voluntary donations, such that no part of the funds used in the purchase is provided directly or indirectly by the State, a State body or any public or local authority, which includes lottery funding; and,the appliance is subject to a recommendation by the Minister for Health and Children that, having regard to the requirements of the health services in the State, a refund of tax would be appropriate.Individual medical instruments or appliances costing less than €25,390 (exclusive of VAT) therefore do not qualify for a VAT refund under the scheme. Claims for refund in respect of other donated equipment meeting the above conditions must be made within 4 years, and should be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners VAT on Registered Repayments Section, River House, Charlotte Quay, Limerick.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The recruitment and promotion moratorium announced on Friday 27th March 2009 applies to the civil service, local authorities, non-commercial state bodies, the Garda Síochána and the Permanent Defence Forces. It is not an embargo.  An embargo would imply that no filling of vacancies whatsoever could take place.  The Minister for Finance has the authority to allow for the filling of some vacancies in very exceptional circumstances.  The Government decision also provides that vacancies may be filled by redeployment of staff from other Departments or public bodies with the sanction of the Department of Finance.  In addition, arrangements for the health and education sectors have been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible.The moratorium decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.  Any exceptions to this principle,which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Department of Finance.  Such sanction would be given only if the Department of Finance was satisfied that the post is essential to the delivery of a public service or performance of an essential function and that every effort has been made to fill the post by redeployment.  With regard to persons on panels, the position is that panels from open competitions generally stay in place until the next competition is held.  Interdepartmental promotion panels have a definite life span and this is agreed centrally with the relevant Civil Service union. Departmental promotion panels also have a definite life span and this is agreed locally with the relevant Civil Service union.In the context of the Moratorium, a decision has been taken that interdepartmental promotion panels will be allowed to lapse as the closure date is reached. Decisions in respect of Departmental promotion panels will be taken at Departmental level.  Regarding the position of temporary staff, in general, such staff are recruited for specific business needs and they remain in the relevant posts while the business need continues.  As the wider public sector includes a very broad range of organisations and bodies, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not have detailed information on the number of temporary or contract staff that exist.  However, I have asked my Department to contact other Departments and Offices to seek data for bodies under their aegis and my Department will convey the results to the Deputy.Regarding the question of a person on a panel feeling discriminated against, the Deputy will be appreciate that I do not have details of the instance in question and moreover that I cannot comment on individual cases.  I am satisfied, however, that the moratorium is necessary and appropriate in the current economic circumstances.  No decision has yet been taken on future recruitment and promotion.

The Department has its own in-house legal adviser in certain functional areas, and in certain cases would avail of the services of the Offices of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General.  My Department does, from time to time, require specific legal services on certain matters not available elsewhere; in such instances, save in exceptional cases, normal public procurement processes are followed.  With regard to agencies under the remit of my Department, the following is the position:
Office of the Revenue Commissioners
I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have a number of different arrangements for the engagement of solicitors and barristers. They have entered into contracts with six firms of external solicitors to provide legal services associated with debt collection and associated enforcement processes.  These firms are engaged following a public procurement process which includes the publication of a request for tender document which invites firms that fulfil certain criteria to submit a tender for the supply of legal and debt collection services.  This is followed by an evaluation of the tenders and an invitation to those deemed suitable, to attend for interview.  The contract entered into by the successful firms usually extends for a period of six years.  Contracts covering the period 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2015 have recently been agreed.In addition, a number of solicitor firms provide Commissioner for Oaths services to Revenue.  Five such firms are engaged at present with contracts valid until 30 June 2012.  In this instance, a number of firms were invited to express an interest in providing the service based on the following criteria:Ability to attend at specified locations at specified times and dates each week.Ability to comply with urgent requests for attendance outside of the normal days of attendance.Ability to cover periods of absence of regular Commissioner i.e. holidays, sick leave or other work commitments.Production of a current tax clearance certificate.Finally, it is open to practising Barristers to apply at any time for nomination as Counsel by the Revenue Solicitor. A form for this purpose is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ieThe Commission for Public Service AppointmentsThe Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) does not have legal panels for solicitors and barristers.  However the CPSA has a contract to provide legal advice on the interpretation of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, other statutes, statutory instruments, regulations as applying to Public Service under the Commission's remit.  The current contract for these legal services is with Matheson, Ormsby, Prentice (MOP). This Office complies with the Procurement Regulations as appropriate.Office of Public WorksLegal advice required by the Office of Public Works (OPW) is supplied by the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO).  A Service Level Agreement (SLA) was entered into between OPW and CSSO in early 2005, as part of which a number of panels of external solicitors were created.  Eight areas of specialised legal expertise were identified and a panel of solicitors created for each.  The areas were:Commercial ContractsCompensation and Drainage SchemeConstruction ContractsCopyright and Art ManagementEmployment LawHealth and SafetyNational and EU ProcurementPlanning and Development.The process for getting on the panels involved a series of interviews conducted by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Firms were judged in eight fields of expertise and awarded marks according to their knowledge and experience of the area, commitment to service, backup personnel, continuous professional development, proactive approach to dealing with CSSO and OPW and approach to minimisation of costs.  A review of the SLA is planned and, as part of the process, the panels will be reviewed.The State Laboratory, Valuation Office, and the Public Appointments Service do not have any such panels.

In some cases, where meetings would be held away from the normal location of such an officer, travel expenses can be paid in accordance with normal civil service rules.  In the case of agencies under the aegis of my Department, I have been advised that in relation to the office of the Revenue Commissioners, Office of Public Works, Valuation Office, State Laboratory, Public Appointments Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments, there are no civil servants who receive fees, salary or remuneration for membership of Boards of agencies under the aegis of my Department.The general policy is that public servants should not receive additional remuneration for undertaking other duties in the Public Service, such as acting as directors of state-sponsored bodies or serving on commissions or other such bodies.  The principle, usually referred to as the "one person one salary" principle, was first enunciated by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in 1972, and it has been a feature of the Public Service since then.  The policy was most recently restated in a letter to the secretaries general of all Government departments in 2006.The Review Body subsequently recommended that payment of fees could be sanctioned in exceptional circumstances.  This policy has been implemented on the basis that each of the following conditions must be met:(1) that the duties involved are neither a part nor an extension of the officer's normal duties, and(2) that a rigid insistence on the principle of one person-one salary would deny scarce skills to the State, and(3) that payment is permitted for one additional appointment only, and(4) that the approval of the Department of Finance for additional payments is required in each case, and(5) that in no case should payment exceed the normal fee for the activity concerned, and(6) that the duration of such payment should be limited to one term or 5 years whichever is greater.One civil servant of my Department receives the normal board fee as a member of the board of a State agency which is under the aegis of another Department as that appointment meets these conditions.

I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that persons entitled to hold a full medical card are specifically excluded from the income levy as introduced on 1st May 2009. The individual should supply sufficient evidence to his pension provider that he holds a full medical card. The pension provider will cease deductions of the income levy and can refund immediately any amount of income levy already deducted this year.It is not necessary for pension providers to wait until the end of year to make any refund due in medical card cases. This matter relates to the case of an individual An Post pensioner and the answer will depend on the specific circumstances involved.  The pension related deduction, also known as the pension levy, which was introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, only applies to payments made to a public servant for his/her services as a public servant.  This means that it would not generally apply to pension income.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The banking system is not functioning as it should be and today I am introducing major new legislation to address this issue. To deal with credit specifically, the Deputy will be aware that a core Government objective is to free up lending on a commercial basis into the economy to support economic growth and a number of actions have been taken to achieve this objective.  In the context of the bank guarantee scheme and recapitalisation the banks have made important commitments to support business lending.As part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. The Financial Regulator have been monitoring compliance with this commitment and no issues have arisen requiring attention.   Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with the banks concerned in relation to their progress on implementing these measures.The Mazars Review of SME lending showed that demand had fallen sharply, with the value of new applications for credit down by 42%. Stock of credit remained static, indicating that new credits matched repayments. I understand that in a normal year, 15% to 20% of outstanding credit might be repaid, so that significant lending must take place, even to keep the figure constant.  There has been much comment on cases of refusal of credit by banks. The Review found that refusal rates vary markedly by sector from 6% to 48% according to the SMEs surveyed. This finding clearly contradicts the allegation of a blanket refusal to lend. Mazars also examined a sample of files where credit was refused and found that, in general, "refusal seemed reasonable in the context of normal commercial and business criteria."Looking to the future, my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has set up a Clearing Group including representatives from the main banks, business interests and state agencies, which is chaired by her Department.  The purpose of the group is to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  As part of the ongoing work of the Clearing Group, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is calling for submissions from viable businesses that have been refused credit by banks. Such businesses, where the flow of credit appears to be blocked, can now send their details to a dedicated e-mail contact point at the Department.Although the Group cannot act as an appeal mechanism for individual cases of credit refusal, it is charged with seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to any patterns identified. Information provided by businesses will inform and assist this work. The e-mail contact for submissions to the Credit Supply Clearing Group is creditsupplyclearinggroup@entemp.ie  With regard to using my influence through the two public interest directors, the Deputy should be aware that those non-executive Directors appointed in the public interest are treated the same under company law as other directors.  Their fiduciary responsibility is to the company and I would stress that these directors do not have a reporting relationship to me or to my Department.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not maintained in a manner which can identify Revenue compliance interventions or activities specific to one-off house building sites or extensions. Revenue maintains statistics on its activities in the construction industry as a whole, and has completed 1,794 audits in the industry to end August 2009, recovering €62m in taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, 83 site visits and 12,155 assurance checks yielding a further €10m have been completed up to the same date. The Commissioners have advised me that as part of their compliance programmes at a local level, projects are undertaken from time to time drawing on information about planning permissions for one-off housing.The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group operates under the chairmanship of the Revenue Commissioners bringing together the Social Partners and the government departments involved in policing the shadow economy. In this regard, the Revenue's Joint Investigation Unit works closely with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) in relation to specific shadow economy risks.  The Revenue Commissioners keep their audit and tax compliance programmes under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from any upsurge in the shadow economy.  In total in 2008, Revenue completed 13,414 audits recovering €569.2m in tax, interest and penalties, and over 347,445 assurance checks which brought in €63 million.

That statutory legislative framework places responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of financial institutions with the Financial Regulator. The Regulator is statutorily independent in the exercise of its supervisory functions.The Regulator's statutory consumer protection mandate is aimed at helping consumers make informed decisions in a safe and fair marketplace. In this context, the ‘General Principles' of the Regulator's August 2006Consumer Protection Code (Code) stipulates that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation, it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market.In addition, the Code's ‘Common Rules for all Regulated Entities', sets out specific requirements with which a regulated entity must comply in areas such as its terms of business, provision of information to the consumer, preservation of a consumer's rights, knowing the consumer, suitability, unsolicited contact (cold calling), disclosure requirements, handling complaints, conflicts of interest, Chinese walls and compliance with the Code.  Chapter 6 of the Code contains specific requirements in relation to investment products including, in relation to tracker bonds, a requirement to warn the customer that the value of an investment may go down as well as up.Furthermore, the Regulator's July 2006Minimum Competency Requirements set out minimum standards across all financial service providers which are applicable to individuals who, on a professional basis, as, for, or on behalf of, a regulated firm provide advice to consumers on retail financial products, arrange or offer to arrange retail financial products for consumers or undertake certain specified activities.  Retail financial products include shares, bonds and other investment instruments and savings, investment and pension products.  Regulated entities are required to comply with both the Code and Minimum Competency Requirements as a matter of law and the Regulator will investigate any matter brought to its attention where it appears that these, or any other regulatory requirement, may have been breached by an entity.Any allegation of mis-selling of financial products is a serious matter and will be treated as such by the relevant authorities and any complaint regarding the conduct of a regulated entity should be brought to the attention of the Regulator for investigation.  Where found by the Regulator to have breached its obligations, a regulated entity may be subject to financial or other sanctions, up to and including withdrawal of its authorisation.The Deputy may wish to note that where a customer has a complaint regarding his / her treatment which has not been resolved through the internal complaints resolution systems of a regulated entity, the customer may also bring the matter to the attention of the Financial Services Ombudsman for investigation.  I am satisfied therefore that adequate provisions are in place to regulate the activities to which the Deputy refers.  However, if it considered that additional powers are required to address such matters, I am open to considering appropriate suggestions for changes to the statutory framework.

The OPW also undertook to investigate the feasibility of carrying out limited silt removal in the "New Cut" area to establish the impact this would have on water levels.  Due to the environmental sensitivity of the area, it has not been possible to date to devise a scheme that would be both acceptable to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and justifiable on cost-benefit grounds.Arising from recent representations from the IFA, requesting further works to improve channel conveyance capacity, OPW officials met with the NPWS in early September.  The OPW is currently seeking to identify works that might be environmentally acceptable, with a view to reverting to the NPWS in the near future.  The OPW has also written to Waterways Ireland in relation to the concerns expressed by landowners in the area regarding maintenance of channels and management of water levels.  I have personally visited the area on two occasions in the past twelve months in the company of the President of the IFA, Pádraig Walsh, and local residents and farmers, to see the situation for myself and to talk through the issues.

Following those trials and any necessary changes to the vessel, shipyard personnel are due to deliver the cutter to Ireland for handover to Revenue Customs in the last week of September. The actual delivery date is dependent on the duration of the sea trials and weather conditions during the voyage from Finland to Ireland.  Allowing for a short period of time for crew familiarisation, it is expected that the cutter will come into full service in the second half of October.

These aerodromes, together with all other small aerodromes/airstrips where there is a possibility for flights to arrive from outside the State, are also subject to customs checks, having regard to the level of risk at the aerodrome in question. However, it is not appropriate to publish details of the number of checks in each case, as this could prejudice the control being applied.200720082009 (to end August)Cork325,500331,200207,500Donegal448860Dublin3,455,8314,457,2082,996,864Galway176444290Kerry4,5004,8002,500Knock6069901,275Shannon167,182143,08967,546Sligo724060Waterford600902165Weston187625

Their main function is the detection of illicit drugs, but there is also one team trained to detect tobacco/cigarettes and one team trained to detect currency. The Deputy will appreciate that illicit cash movements are the lifeblood of organised crime and drug trafficking.  The detector dog teams play an important role in delivering on Revenue's commitments to the Supply Reduction Pillar of the Government's National Drugs Strategy; and the recently published strategy document for the period 2009-2016 recognises this.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	641	In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers,  the Government decided that, with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade. The decision applies to all grades of permanent and temporary staff, including nursing, notwithstanding a number of specific exemptions, some of which are highlighted below. A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability. The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.  The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.The HSE operates a sponsorship scheme for eligible and experienced public service employees who wish to train as nurses/midwives. This scheme was introduced to provide a career development pathway for health care assistants and other support staff who are involved in the delivery of care to patients and clients of the public health service.  While these students were undertaking the nursing degree programme they retained their substantive posts and are paid accordingly. There are forty seven students in this cohort who have signed sponsorship contracts which require them to work for their sponsoring employer for a minimum of five years. These student nurses are now due to graduate and register as nurses.  The HSE is in discussion with my Department about the implications for this scheme of the moratorium and further information has been sought ahead of making a submission to the Department of Finance on the matter.

Children will qualify for the free pre-school year where they are age between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months in September each year.  The application of this age range is being interpreted as generously as possible to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September.This will mean that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  In September 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2006 or on or before 30 June 2007 will qualify, and so on in subsequent years.  As eligibility is determined by reference to age, the child in question would not be eligible to participate in the scheme in January 2010 being aged 3 years and 1 month old on 1 September 2009, but would be eligible on 1 September 2010 when she will be aged 4 years and 1 month old.  Exceptions to the upper age limit will be allowed where children are assessed by the HSE to have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.

I have advised the House and parent/prospective adoptive parent representative groups on many occasions regarding the developments in relation to those discussions. I must emphasise, yet again, that the Government's objective is to provide a regime in which the child is at the centre of the adoption process, whether it is an intercountry or domestic adoption, and that adoptions are effected in a manner which is safe and secure.The most important development in achieving that objective is the development of an appropriate legislative regime which recognises the changed and changing global situation regarding adoption over the last 20 years. The Adoption Bill, which includes the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child. A core principle of the Adoption Bill and the Hague Convention is that the child's interests must be paramount. The Hague Convention, which is given the force of law in this Bill, effectively puts in place an agreement between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is to safeguard that acceptable standards are being applied in other countries, over which we have no jurisdiction.Over the last month two significant Reports have been undertaken regarding child welfare, protection and adoption in Vietnam.  Firstly, in August 2009 Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs with technical assistance UNICEF in Vietnam published a report entitled "Creating a protective environment for children in Viet Nam : An assessment of child protection laws and policies, especially children in special circumstances in Viet Nam” . Some of the issues raised in this Report had already been under consideration in the context of ongoing deliberations of the drafting of a new bilateral agreement with the Vietnamese. However, this Report has highlighted significant policy and legal implications and warrants further deliberation.Furthermore, I have received in draft form a report of an examination of intercountry adoption in Vietnam carried out by the International Social Services (ISS). The Report was commissioned by UNICEF in coordination with the Ministry of Justice of Vietnam. It aims, inter alia, to "identify and address problems in both domestic and Intercountry Adoption processes with a view to assisting Vietnam in its preparations to ratify the Hague Convention”. This report is likely to give rise to further issues that will need to be considered.I must stress that these two reports, both prepared in co-operation with the Vietnamese Government, and UNICEF, go to the heart of the matter in relation to concerns in relation to intercountry adoption in Vietnam. I would be failing in my duty to protect children if I did not acknowledge and consider the content of these reports extremely carefully before deciding on next steps. In saying that, these Reports also serve to highlight the commitment of the Vietnamese Government to ensuring that the adoption process in Vietnam is in line with the best international standards and their willingness to address issues at the core of that commitment.  I am currently awaiting finalisation of the ISS Report. While work is continuing on the draft of the Agreement under discussion, I am of the view that the next round of talks at official level in Ireland should await the outcome of our consideration of these two reports.This is an extremely sensitive matter and I am aware of the likely concerns of the many Irish families that have already adopted children from Vietnam. I have consulted with the Adoption Board and they have advised that all adoptions from Vietnam, which have been registered on the Register of Foreign Adoptions, are safe and secure.  I am also acutely conscious of the concerns of prospective adoptive parents. Over the past number of months I have met regularly with both individual prospective adoptive parents and representative groups.  I am deeply aware of the angst, frustration and emotion that prospective adoptive parents continue to experience at this time. I have communicated at every opportunity updates on these matters and I have committed to continuing with this process. I can only reiterate that my personal commitment and the Government's commitment is to seeking the necessary assurances to allow us to proceed to conclude an intercountry adoption agreement with Vietnam.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	648	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.  Services participating in the scheme in January 2010 will accept enrolments over the coming months.  The ECCE scheme is a general one and services participating will be required to make reasonable accommodation for children with special needs in accordance with the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004.  However, the scheme takes account of a number of issues to accommodate children with special needs.While the age range in which children will qualify for the scheme is, generally, between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September each year, exceptions are allowed where a child has been assessed by the HSE as having a special need which will delay his or her entry to primary school.  In such cases, the pre-school year relevant to such children will be taken as their qualifying year. Additionally, the general requirement that a child would be expected to attend 4 or 5 days each week will not apply to children with special needs where a shorter week would be more appropriate to their needs.Many specialist pre-school services arrange for children attending their services to also attend a mainstream service for 1, 2, or 3 days a week.  In such cases, a single place in a mainstream service may cater for 2 or more children over the course of the week.  While pro-rata arrangements will not generally be allowed to continue beyond September 2010, they will be allowed to continue for children with special needs.  Where appropriate, children with special needs and attending a pre-school service on a pro-rata basis, may be permitted to avail of a second free pre-school year e.g. attending 2 days per week in the first year and 3 days per week in the second.  Should additional flexibility in the arrangements for the scheme be required by specialist pre-school services for children with special needs, these will also be considered.

It collates medical card and GP visit card  data by county, age and gender.  Therefore, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) 32 local health areas.  However, under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising. The HSE has also given an assurance that specific queries in relation to any medical card application will be followed through to completion, as quickly as possible.The HSE has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE to other critical frontline services and the Executive is working through the formal process with the trade union involved.  This flexibility by public service workers is essential in the context of the current economic environment.Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications;Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	658	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which provides a free Pre-School year to eligible children and which will be introduced in January 2010.  It is a requirement of the ECCE scheme that pre-school leaders in services participating in the scheme hold a qualification in childcare which is equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  However, in the first two full years of the scheme, the requirement will be met where a person holds a childcare qualification that includes the four core modules of Early Education, Child Development, Caring for Children and Work Experience and has at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility with children in the 0 -6 age range.Quite a number of workers in the ECCE sector lack formal qualifications but have many years of experience.  The challenge now is to recognise the non-formal learning of workers in this position and to ensure that there are flexible ways for people to obtain qualifications and to build on these qualifications.  Ireland has been participating in an OECD study on the recognition of non-formal and informal learning.  A national report was drafted in 2006/2007 by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland with the assistance of an Advisory Group and, in particular, with HETAC and FETAC.  The aim of the report was to document and review the current situation in Ireland regarding the recognition of prior non-formal and informal learning.  The OECD's review team report was published in December 2008 and a national action plan for the Recognition of Prior Learning is now being developed.Service providers with pre-school year leaders who do not hold the required qualification in all four modules in time to enter the scheme in respect of January/August 2010, will have a further opportunity to enter the scheme in respect of the pre-school year commencing in September 2010.

In 2001 and 2004 the Department of Education and Science issued Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures to all primary and post-primary schools, based on Children First. These guidelines outline the reporting procedures to be followed by schools when an allegation of abuse comes to light, including the reporting of same to the HSE and other agencies, such as An Garda Síochána. The guidelines for schools require each Board of Management to designate a senior member of staff as the Designated Liaison Person (DLP) for the school. The DLP acts as a liaison person with the health authorities and other agencies on child protection issues and as a resource for any staff member who has concerns in this regard.  I have no direct function in relation to the work of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	670	There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme, which was introduced on a statutory basis in 1971.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 1999, no individual or family unit pays more than €100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	672	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010 under which capital grant funding is made available to community and commercial childcare providers for the development of childcare facilities.  Applications for capital grant funding under the NCIP were processed, in the first instance, by the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs).  To assist them in this process, each CCC was advised of the indicative capital budget against which they should prioritise applications during 2008.  The total indicative capital budgets advised to the CCCs for 2008 amounted to €125 million.  Having assessed and prioritised capital grant applications against their 2008 indicative capital budgets, the CCCs forwarded the applications received by them to Pobal, who manage the day to day implementation of the NCIP on behalf of my Office, in June 2008.A further assessment of the applications was carried out by Pobal and resulted in applications with a total value of €85 million being forwarded for consideration and approval by this Office in Autumn 2008, coinciding with the economic downturn and the review of Government expenditure which took place at that time, particularly in relation to the undertaking of additional capital commitments.  It was necessary to defer any decision in respect of new capital commitments pending the outcome of the expenditure review.  In April 2009, this Office was advised that no further capital commitments could be undertaken at that point and the closure of the NCIP capital programme to new applicants was announced.In discussions with the Department of Finance, this Office pressed to secure some additional funding to enable projects which were considered to be high priority to proceed.  Key criteria in determining priority applications were severe disadvantage and where an existing community service was in danger of closure if necessary repairs required by the HSE Inspectorate could not be carried out.  As a result, it was agreed that additional funding amounting to €10.6 million, to assist 29 applicants, would be allocated to the programme in 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I propose to take Questions Nos. 372 and 433 together.I met with the support group referred to by the Deputy at the end of June last and undertook to consider their submission which included a request for an independent inquiry.  I have arranged to discuss the issues involved this week with my colleague the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General before consulting with the Cabinet about any actions that could reasonably be taken in this regard.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I propose to take Questions Nos. 373, 374, 376 and 429 together.The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 was signed into law by the President on the 1st July. Certain sections of the Act were commenced on the 3rd July to enable the National Treatment Purchase Fund to immediately begin price negotiations with private nursing homes. The Minister intends to implement the scheme once these negotiations are concluded and no later than the final quarter of this year.  Applicants to the scheme must undergo a care needs assessment to determine whether they need nursing home care and a financial assessment to determine their ability to contribute towards their own care.  Based on the outcome of both these assessments, the HSE will decide on the payment of financial support.Under the new scheme, individuals will contribute 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of any assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum. The asset disregard is the amount of a person's assets that is totally excluded from the financial assessment. The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual or €72,000 for a couple.  Where a person's assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and can be collected from their estate. This is an optional element of the scheme called "Ancillary State support".A person's principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap.  It means that individuals will pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After 3 years, even if they are still getting long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether individuals choose to opt for Ancillary State support or not. In the case of a couple, the contribution based on the principal residence will be capped at 7.5% where one partner remains in the home while the other enters long-term residential care.The ‘three year' cap will also extend to farms and business in certain circumstances.  If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime.  Finally, there are important safeguards built in to the Financial Assessment which are worth noting: nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care; individuals will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater; if there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.When the Care Needs and Financial Assessments have been completed, the HSE will provide a list of nursing homes to choose from.  The list will include public, voluntary and approved private nursing homes.  Approved private nursing homes are homes which have agreed the price charged for care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and are approved for the purposes of the scheme.  Individuals can choose care in any nursing home on the list, subject to the following conditions: the facility must be able to cater for their particular needs; and the facility must have a place for them.  A person's choice of facility is not connected in any way to the level of their contribution to care.If a public or voluntary nursing home is selected, the  person will pay their contribution to the HSE or voluntary nursing home, as appropriate, each week and the State will pay the balance. If an approved private nursing home is selected, the person will pay their contribution to the nursing home provider each week and the State will pay the balance.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	702	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new Early Childhood Care and Education scheme (ECCE) which provides a free Pre-School year to eligible children and which will be introduced in January 2010.  It is also a condition of the pre-school year that services who wish to participate will be required to provide an appropriate educational programme for children which adheres to the principles of Síolta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education.  Síolta is a quality assurance process which addresses all aspects of practice in early childhood care and education services. It is designed to support practitioners to develop high quality services for children aged birth to six years.  Services participating in the scheme will be supported by a national team of  Siolta Co-Ordinators and the City and County Childcare Committees.In addition, the Curricular Framework for Early Learning Aistear, has been developed in consultation with the sector by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  Aistear will support practitioners in planning for and providing enriching, challenging and enjoyable learning opportunities for children from birth to six years.  The NCCA will be developing exemplars for use by services which will be available on-line.It is a requirement of the ECCE scheme that pre-school leaders in services participating in the scheme hold a qualification in childcare which is equivalent to FETAC Level 5.  However, in the first two full years of the scheme, the requirement will be met where a person holds a childcare qualification that includes the four core modules of Early Education, Child Development, Caring for Children and Work Experience and has at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility with children in the 0-6 age range.National and international research has established that there is a close relationship between the capacity and qualifications of the workforce in early childhood care and education settings and the quality of young children's early experiences. There is a commitment to the upskilling of the workforce in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) sector and a Workforce Development Plan for the sector will be published in 2010.   A consultative process is currently underway and will conclude at the end of this month. As part of the development of the Workforce Development Plan for the ECCE sector, an analysis of the educational attainment of people employed in childcare sector was carried out.   This analysis draws on data from the National Skills database and shows a major shift towards higher qualification levels since 1999.  The condition that services participating in the ECCE must have appropriately qualified staff to deliver the pre-school year, is expected to support this upward trend.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	706	Ireland has, through putting in place advance purchase agreements with two vaccine manufacturers prior to the declaration of the pandemic, secured a total of 7.7m doses of pandemic vaccine. This quantity of vaccine is sufficient to allow the pandemic vaccine to be offered to the whole population and the agreements have ensured that we will get priority delivery of the vaccine as it becomes available. The first doses of the vaccine have arrived in Ireland.The Health Service Executive is finalising the details of the Pandemic Vaccination Programme. This is an enormous and logistically complex undertaking. The launch of the programme will depend on when the vaccines will be licensed and the availability of sufficient stock of the vaccine. The vaccine will not be administered pre-licence. It will take up to 12 months for all of the vaccine to be delivered and any delays in delivery schedules will affect the vaccination programme. It is hoped that we will be able to commence vaccination in mid October. The launch of the plan needs to be carefully managed in order to gain maximum publicity in the interest of attaining a high level of uptake. Health care workers will be vaccinated in hospitals and other healthcare facilities while the rest of the population will be vaccinated primarily in specially established mass vaccination centres. Each individual will, on the basis of current WHO guidelines, receive two doses of vaccine. The licence will specify the timing of the second dose but it is anticipated that it will be given three weeks after the first.Initially this vaccine will be offered to Health Care Workers and after that to those people with increased medical risk. The rest of the population will then be offered the vaccine on a staged basis.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I propose to take Questions Nos. 385, 386, 388 and 389 together.The overall conclusion reached by the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body (AMCMB) in their annual reports for 2007 and 2008 was that there continues to be overall compliance with the Codes to limit the exposure of young people to alcohol advertising.  The AMCMB is satisfied that the media partners and the Irish alcohol industry are committed to ensuring that the Codes are adhered to by the organisations they represent.The partners to the Codes have not completed a formal review of the operation of the Codes since the publication of the AMCMB 2008 Report on 10th July 2009.  However, the code partners are committed to such a review taking place as soon as practicable.  The locations where restrictions currently apply to the display of outdoor alcohol advertising are identified by the Outdoor Media companies who own the display areas in question. The Department does not have the number or the location of the places where restrictions apply. However, these companies have undertaken to adhere to the Code on alcohol advertising and take the necessary steps to replace alcohol advertising displays where new locations are identified or brought to their attention.I am aware of the concerns expressed in the findings of the National Youth Council of Ireland's Report entitled "Get Em Young".  The Codes on alcohol advertising and sponsorship seek to reduce exposure of young people to alcohol advertising but there are huge challenges being posed by the range of multimedia formats, both national and international, which are accessible to young people.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The number of deliberate self-harm presentations reported in 2008 was 11,700 which represented a 6% increase on 2007 figures. There was a significant increase in deliberate self-harm rates in the age groups 10-14 and 15-19.  In the age category 10-14 there were a total of 260 deliberate self-harm presentations of which 63 were boys and 197 were girls.  This figure represents an overall increase of 39% on 2007 figures.  In the age category 15-19 there were a total of 1,704 presentations of which 648 were boys and 1,056 were girls.  This figure represents an overall increase of 9% on 2007 figures — 16.3% among boys and 5% among girls.The increase in the number and rate of deliberate self-harm presentations is a concern.  However, a number of initiatives have been developed by the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention to address the issue, including the development of an awareness campaign aimed at young people.  Consultations with young people were arranged under the auspices of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to inform the campaign and a report on the outcomes of this process —‘Teenage Mental Health: What helps? and What hurts? was launched on 15th June 2009.  The campaign, which will take account of the high rate of deliberate self-harm among young people, is expected to be launched on 12th October 2009.There is progression in the availability of deliberate self-harm services through Hospital Emergency departments and development of a standardised approach to deliberate self harm presentations at Hospital Emergency departments.  In this regard, the National Office and the National Suicide Research Foundation will jointly host a meeting in October aimed at standardising the approach to deliberate self-harm presentations.  There is development of technology-based initiatives such as a Samaritans texting service, an on-line counselling directory website and on-line treatments for depression.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	729	In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care.  It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.  The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services. In addition, special provisions apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.I wish to advise that as part of the Employment Control Framework for the health sector, the Joint Employment Control Monitoring Committee, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the HSE, meets regularly to monitor health employment levels and to review the implementation of the moratorium and any issues arising.

Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.  The HSE commissioned Horwath Consulting Ireland, in association with Teamwork Management Services to carry out a review of acute hospital services in the HSE South, based on the principle of securing clinically safe and sustainable acute hospital services.  The report was launched publicly on the 9 June 2009. Professor John Higgins has been appointed as Director of Reconfiguration of Acute Services, Cork & Kerry Region.The Teamwork report proposes a single health care system for Cork and Kerry with the development of a new governance structure for the hospitals and community to encompass the relationship between the health care system and the third level educational sector (UCC, CIT, ITT).  The principles that apply are that complex clinical care should be concentrated on the Cork University Hospital campus and that the other hospitals should where possible provide an expanded range of day surgery, diagnostic and out patient services.  The reconfiguration process involves both enhancing primary care services and moving hospital services as close as practicable to people's homes.It is clear that in this context hospitals will have to change significantly the type of services they provide and the way these are delivered.  Reorganisation of services must of course occur in consultation with the key stakeholders and on an incremental basis.  I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time.  As the detailed questions raised are service matters, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	745	The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 was signed into law by the President on the 1st July. Certain sections of the Act were commenced on the 3rd July to enable the National Treatment Purchase Fund to immediately begin price negotiations with private nursing homes. The Minister intends to implement the scheme once these negotiations are concluded and no later than the final quarter of this year.  Once the scheme is operational, individuals may apply through their local Nursing Home Support Office. The person referred to by the Deputy will not have to undergo a Care Needs Assessment as they are already in a nursing home. Instead they can proceed directly to the Financial Assessment.The HSE will undertake the financial assessment in order to work out each person's contribution to care based on their ability to pay.  Under the new scheme, individuals will contribute 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of any assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum. The asset disregard is the amount of a person's assets that is totally excluded from the financial assessment. The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual or €72,000 for a couple.  Where a person's assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and can be collected from their estate. This is an optional element of the scheme called "Ancillary State support".A person's principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap.  It means that individuals will pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After 3 years, even if they are still getting long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether individuals choose to opt for Ancillary State support or not. In the case of a couple, the contribution based on the principal residence will be capped at 7.5% where one partner remains in the home while the other enters long-term residential care.The ‘three year' cap will also extend to farms and business in certain circumstances.  If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime.Finally, there are important safeguards built in to the Financial Assessment which are worth noting.Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.Individuals will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.When the Care Needs and Financial Assessments have been completed, the HSE will provide a list of nursing homes to choose from.  The list will include public, voluntary and approved private nursing homes.  Approved private nursing homes are homes which have agreed the price charged for care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and are approved for the purposes of the scheme.Individuals can choose care in any nursing home on the list, subject to the following conditions:The facility must be able to cater for their particular needs, andThe facility must have a place for them.A person's choice of facility is not connected in any way to the level of their contribution to care.  If a public or voluntary nursing home is selected, the person will pay their contribution to the HSE or voluntary nursing home, as appropriate, each week and the State will pay the balance. If an approved private nursing home is selected, the person will pay their contribution to the nursing home provider each week and the State will pay the balance.  Finally, I have arranged for an Information Leaflet, FAQ's and Examples of Co-payment under the scheme to be posted to the Deputy for the benefit of the individuals referred to in the question.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	746	Before 1st October, 1979 junior hospital doctors, being temporary post holders, did not have access to employee superannuation schemes in the public health sector.  On 1st August, 1979 the Department of the Environment issued Circular Letter S. 6/79 which provided access to superannuation schemes for junior hospital doctors.  I am arranging for a copy of the relevant circular to be forwarded to you directly.  It also sets out the procedure for reckoning service by junior hospital doctors in voluntary hospitals from 1969, when the relevant scheme was introduced, and also for reckoning pre-scheme service.Junior hospital doctors employed in a public hospital from 1st October, 1979 had their names entered in the register of pensionable officers and they paid employee pension contributions to the relevant superannuation scheme.  Where such employees preserved benefits (this was mandatory once 5 years service was accumulated), a preserved pension benefit accrued.  Where the employee took up future public sector pensionable employment, the junior hospital doctor service transferred on a knock-for-knock basis between public schemes.  If the employee left the public service without preserving benefits, s/he would be entitled to re-instate such service at a future date if s/he re-entered public sector employment.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 501 together.Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) 32 local health areas.  However, under the HSE's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications will transfer to the Executive's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.The HSE has advised my Department that there are no plans to close any of the local health offices and these offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.  However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE to other critical frontline services and the Executive is working through the formal process with the trade union involved.  This flexibility by public service workers is essential in the context of the current economic environment.Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.I fully support the HSE's decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications;Equitable application of eligibility across the country;Consistency of service provision to customers;Clearer lines of governance and accountability; andImproved unified data.The HSE has also indicated that this project, while realising health sector efficiencies and savings, will not have an adverse affect on patient care or the quality of service provided.  This project is an example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November.  It demonstrates how improved services can be delivered within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.

Services can choose to deliver the preschool year from a range of options.  A full or part-time day-care service will normally provide the place for 2 hours 15 minutes a day, five days a week over 50 weeks, in return for a weekly capitation fee of €48.50.  A playschool sessional service will normally be required to provide a pre-school service for 3 hours a day, five days a week over 38 weeks, in return for a weekly capitation fee of €64.50.  However, where for good reason a sessional service is unable to operate over 5 days, it may participate in the scheme by providing a place for 3 hours 30 minutes, 4 days a week over 41 weeks (157 days).Further flexibility is provided for in that, a full or part-time service may choose to provide a sessional service over 38 weeks of a year (or two sessional services each day) while a sessional service may choose to provide 2 hours 15 minutes per day over 50 weeks.  Also in cases where children attend a full or part-time day-care service for 3 days a week only, consideration will be given to allowing the service to participate in the scheme on the basis of providing the pre-school year to those children for 3 hours 45 minutes a day for 3 days a week.  In such cases, a service will be required to provide the preschool year over 50 weeks.

Because staff who retire under the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard is essential.My Department understands that the directive issued by the majority of health service trade unions instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management is still in place.  This instruction severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  However, applications can still be made to the relevant employer in anticipation of a resolution of the industrial relations issues and a further Circular (17/2009) has issued extending the closing date of the incentivised scheme for early retirement to 16 October, 2009.  Talks will continue on the issue and it is hoped that a satisfactory resolution will be found.

To date interest of €60,900 in total was distributed to 1,120 clients.Clients who have received payments directly to their PPP accounts to date have been provided with individual statements outlining the amount of interest received. The HSE is now seeking to identify the rightful recipients of the remainder of these funds.  In many cases clients are either discharged or are deceased.  There is a significant administrative task in establishing the present whereabouts of the persons entitled to receive this payment.The HSE has also commenced a project to facilitate the electronic receipt of Department of Social and Family Affairs allowances on behalf of HSE clients. Such payments will commence later this month.  This project is drawing on the same staff resources as those involved in the processing of retained interest payments and was not anticipated earlier in the year.  The calculation and processing of returned interest payments will re-commence once the project is complete.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	790	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new Early Childhood Care and Education scheme which provides a free Pre-School year to eligible children and which will be introduced in January 2010.As part of the preparations for introducing the new scheme, the Childcare Directorate of my Office wrote to almost 5,000 private and voluntary pre-school service providers in the State, inviting them to participate and outlining the requirements governing the scheme.  The application process is expected to be completed next month following which a list of local services contracted to participate in the scheme, will be available to parents from each City and County Childcare Committee.  In practice, many parents will already have children attending pre-school services which have applied to participate in the scheme and expect to do so, from January 2010.  As indicated above, applicants were made aware of the requirements governing the scheme in June of this year.A key requirement of the scheme is that pre-school leaders must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ) or an equivalent recognised qualification in the childcare/early education field.  In the first two full years of the scheme, the qualification requirement will be met where a person holds an award in ECCE that includes the four core modules of Early Education, Child Development, Caring for Children and Work Experience and has at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility with children in the 0-6 range.As a scheme to provide appropriate programme based educational activities for children in their pre-school year, qualifications in other fields, such as Business Studies, cannot be taken into account.  Services which are unable to demonstrate that they have pre-school year leaders who hold the minimum required level of qualification will not be able to participate in the scheme.  Services can re-apply for entry to the scheme in September 2010.The annual capitation fee of over €2,400 amounts, in the case of a sessional playschool, to €64.50 pew week over 38 weeks.  For full- and part-time services providing a pre-school year of 2 hours 15 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 50 weeks, the annual capitation fee amounts to €48.50 per week.  The capitation fee and its application on a weekly basis are considered reasonable.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	801	Under the Health Act, 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) for inspecting and registering categories of centres, including nursing homes.  HIQA commenced the new system of registration and inspection on July 1st, 2009.  This has for the first time, introduced an independent system of inspection of both public and private nursing homes.   It is important that this new inspection regime is effective, robust, independent and properly resourced.  In this regard the 2007 Act provides for the following fees:Applications for registration or renewal of registration under Section 48.  This section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee.An annual fee payable by the registered provider under Section 99A fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under Section 52.  A registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with their application.Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places, etc. it was decided to set a registration fee of €500, payable every 3 years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of €190 per place in each registered centre.   It is estimated that the fee will represent an average weekly cost of€3.73 per registered place.  The fees are payable by the registered provider (or in the case of applications for registration by the applicant, who for existing designated centres would normally be the registered provider). These fees are not due or payable by the resident or their family.Article 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that:"(1) The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.(2) Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged."Therefore, only those fees, including any agreed increases, set out in the contract should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.

Since 2006, 14 further cases (11 Judicial Review cases and 3 Plenary cases) relating to special education needs were commenced against the Minister for Health and Children.  These cases are broken down as follows:2006: 9 cases (8 Judicial Review, 1 Plenary)2007: 4 cases (3 Judicial Review, 1 Plenary)2008: 1 case (Plenary)2009: 0.In the period from 2006 to date, one special education needs case, which commenced in 2004, was the subject of a High Court adjudication (in 2007).  In that case, the claims against my Department and the Department of Education and Science were dismissed.Such cases are, in the main, taken against the Department of Education and Science and allege a failure on behalf of the State to provide for an appropriate education as provided for in the Constitution. Education and health-related educational supports are provided by the education sector and by the Health Service Executive, respectively.  My Department is involved due to its role in the formulation and development of policy in respect of the provision of healthcare and support services.Since 2006, my Department has also contributed towards the settlement of a total of 41 special education needs cases (22 Judicial Review, 19 Plenary) which were initiated prior to 2006.  The cost to my Department, excluding the costs of the State defence which is borne by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in each of the years since 2006 was as follows:2006200720082009 (to date)JR Settlements228,518.75195,002.74171,621.7426,736.74JR Legal Costs81,157.7727,198.26231,802.3345,318.10Plenary Settlements47,219.9932,187.5016,013.031,203.09Plenary Costs351,815.75335,662.27422,700.7068,787.10Total708,712.26590,050.77842,137.80142,045.03In addition, a reimbursement of €597,461.36 was paid in 2006 to the Department of Education and Science in respect of special education needs cases in which they had (prior to 2006) paid the full costs on behalf of the State.  It should be noted that these figures do not include the costs of staff involved in responding to these cases.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	816	The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 was signed into law by the President on the 1st July. Certain sections of the Act were commenced on the 3rd July to enable the National Treatment Purchase Fund to immediately begin price negotiations with private nursing homes. The Minister intends to implement the scheme once these negotiations are concluded and no later than the final quarter of this year.  Once the scheme is operational, individuals may apply through their local Nursing Home Support Office. Applicants to the scheme must undergo a care needs assessment to determine whether they need nursing home care and a financial assessment to determine their ability to contribute towards their own care. Applicants who are already in a nursing home prior to the commencement of the scheme do not need to undergo the care needs assessment, instead they can proceed directly to the financial assessment.Under the new scheme, individuals will contribute 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of any assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum. The asset disregard is the amount of a person's assets that is totally excluded from the financial assessment. The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual or €72,000 for a couple.  Where a person's assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and can be collected from their estate. This is an optional element of the scheme called "Ancillary State support".A person's principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap.  It means that individuals will pay a 5% contribution based on the value of their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After 3 years, even if they are still getting long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether individuals choose to opt for Ancillary State support or not. In the case of a couple, the contribution based on the principal residence will be capped at 7.5% where one partner remains in the home while the other enters long-term residential care.  The ‘three year' cap will also extend to farms and business in certain circumstances.If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime. Finally, there are important safeguards built in to the Financial Assessment which are worth noting.Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.Individuals will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.When the Care Needs and Financial Assessments have been completed, the HSE will provide a list of nursing homes to choose from.  The list will include public, voluntary and approved private nursing homes.  Approved private nursing homes are homes which have agreed the price charged for care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and are approved for the purposes of the scheme.  Individuals can choose care in any nursing home on the list, subject to the following conditions:The facility must be able to cater for their particular needs, andThe facility must have a place for them.A person's choice of facility is not connected in any way to the level of their contribution to care.If a public or voluntary nursing home is selected, the person will pay their contribution to the HSE or voluntary nursing home, as appropriate, each week and the State will pay the balance. If an approved private nursing home is selected, the person will pay their contribution to the nursing home provider each week and the State will pay the balance.  Finally, I have arranged for an Information Leaflet, FAQ's and Examples of Co-payment under the scheme to be posted to the Deputy for the benefit of the individual referred to in the question.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Earlier this year, a specific improvement grant of €600,000 was allocated to Westmeath County Council for works at Garrycastle Bridge.  Last month my Department sought applications for funding under the Specific Improvement Grants scheme in 2010.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	827	The integrated ticketing system in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) is being introduced on a phased basis, based on smartcard technology. A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved.  The project is now firmly in the implementation phase.A smartcard for Luas services has been available on all Luas services for some time. Smartcards have also been introduced by Dublin Bus in respect of a number of ticket products such as annual and monthly tickets and 5-day rambler tickets. There are also annual and monthly integrated bus and rail, and bus and Luas smartcard tickets. The smartcard is now being used by some 30% of Dublin Bus customers.Subject to successful in-house testing, the single smartcard will be rolled out initially to a small number of Dublin Bus testers for live consumer testing of the Dublin Bus/Luas integrated annual ticket, and then to a small number of customers, in early 2010. The smartcards will have electronic purse "pay-as-you-go" capability which will be switched on later in 2010. The single smartcard will continue to be rolled out on Dublin Bus and Luas throughout 2010, so that by end 2010 the pay-as-you-go option will be available to all Dublin Bus and Luas passengers in the GDA.  Further Dublin Bus and Luas ticket products will be released on the smartcard in early 2011.Iarnród Eireann is currently progressing with its plans to introduce an interim smartcard scheme. Stations have been fitted with smartcard readers and the system is currently being tested in advance of launch to the public. Bus Éireann will commence testing in 2010 with roll-out of its pilot phase planned for early 2011 on a number of its services. The company will then evaluate the feasibility of extending the scheme to include its whole network in the GDA. Private bus operators are also participating in the development of the scheme and it is anticipated that a number of these operators, along with Irish Rail Dart and Commuter services, will join the scheme over this timeframe.

While an initial draft has been circulated to city and county councils, a number of Departments (including my own) and other agencies, I understand from the Dublin Transportation Office, that a wider consultation to include the cycling community will commence in late October.  The intention is finalise and publish the manual before the end of this year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	830	Under EU Council Regulation 2408/92, my Department provides compensation to contracted regional air carriers for the operation of air services under the Public Service Obligation (PSO) regime between Dublin and Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo, Donegal and City of Derry regional airports. The services for Sligo/Donegal and Knock/Derry are provided under combined contracts.The contracts are fixed price contracts for each route or route combination and are not based on the number of passengers travelling.  However, I can advise the Deputy that just over 284,000 passengers were carried on the PSO routes in 2008 and the average cost per passenger was 50 Euro. This figure is based on the contracted costs for year 1 of the 2008-2011 contracts (i.e. 22nd July 2008 to 21st July 2009) and the total passenger numbers for the 2008 calendar year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	831	As set out in my Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, the Department of Transport's Guidelines for the Consideration of Passenger Road Licence Applications under the Road Transport Act 1932 encourage all licence holders to use accessible vehicles.  In addition, section 48 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 sets out how bus services are to be procured under the Act from Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and private operators and the main provisions that are to be included in related contracts.  These include a requirement to provide for accessibility standards for the services in question.  Furthermore, under section 13 of the recently published Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009, the National Transport Authority authority will be empowered to impose accessibility conditions on the grant of bus route licences.  However, while this regulatory regime will empower the Authority to impose accessibility standards, the coach manufacturing industry in Europe has only in the last two years begun to produce accessible coaches drawing on research commissioned by the European Commission in this area.There is no EU obligation which requires the use of accessible coaches and the number manufactured to date is still quite small relative to the total number of coaches in use. On the enactment of the Public Transport Regulation Bill, this matter will fall to be considered by the Authority, while ensuring that there is no barrier to the free movement of vehicles.

However, I understand that Aer Lingus would face severe logistical difficulties in U.S. airports in a situation where their ex-Shannon flights would be precleared and their ex-Dublin flights would not. Preclearance will not be available at Dublin Airport until Terminal Two is operational in 2010. Accordingly I understand that the airline has taken a decision to postpone using preclearance for their U.S.-bound flights until the service is available both in Dublin and Shannon.  Responsibility for marketing preclearance facilities at Shannon Airport is a matter for the Shannon Airport Authority.

I took the view at the time that it would be best to provide a reasonable period of time to enable the boards and management of these airports to address the very significant challenges facing the aviation market.  New governance arrangements, which have now been agreed by the three Airport Authorities, will provide an opportunity for Cork and Shannon Airport to realise the potential provided by the very substantial investment in the airports in recent years.  Given the agreement to defer a decision on final separation until 2011 the boards will stay in place until that decision is finalised.

I will give careful consideration to whatever proposals are submitted to me in due course, on foot of this consultation process.  As no proposals have as yet been submitted, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	835	I propose to take Questions Nos. 543 and 546 together.In accordance with section 58 of the Railway Safety Act 2005, the Railway Accident Investigation Unit (RAIU) is now investigating all aspects of the cause of the collapse of the Malahide viaduct.  The RAIU is obliged, other than in exceptional circumstances, to issue a report no later than 12 months after the date of occurrence of the incident but will, I expect, do so as expeditiously as possible.In addition, as provided for under Section 53 of the Railway Safety Act 2005, Irish Rail is undertaking an investigation of the collapse.  In this context, I understand that the Chairman of CIE & Irish Rail has set up a Board Sub-Committee, chaired by a member of the Board, to oversee this internal Irish Rail investigation, which will be supported by independent advisers.  The report of the Irish Rail investigation including all records and data will be made available to the Railway Accident Investigation Unit and the Railway Safety Commission (RSC).In the meantime, I understand that design work for the reconstruction of the viaduct has already commenced.  When completed the designs will be subject to a thorough and independent review by Irish Rail's advisors and by the Railway Safety Commission.  I am informed that Irish Rail is aiming to have the viaduct reopened for rail services by late November 2009.As regards other bridge infrastructure, I understand that a team of Irish Rail engineers has already commenced a programme of inspections of all other Irish Rail bridges.  The team is being supported by structural engineering consultants. Priority is being given to the inspection of other rail bridges over estuaries, lakes, rivers and canals which are susceptible to water scouring.  Irish Rail has in place a safety regime of management systems, inspections regimes and audits, which has been accepted by the Railway Safety Commission.  Alteration to the bridge at Skerries is a matter for Irish Rail.

In relation to Dublin Port Company's planning application the Minister for Transport is a "prescribed body" for such an application and I was duly consulted on the application by An Bord Pleanála.  I have brought the recently published study to the attention of the Board.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	837	I have noted the matters raised in the letter referred to by the Deputy.  The position with regard to Terminal Two in Dublin Airport is that its construction is in accordance with Government policy on the strengthening of airport capacity.  However, airport operational issues, such as the opening of the terminal, are the responsibility of the Dublin Airport Authority.In 2008, on the recommendation of the boards of the three State airport authorities I decided to postpone a decision on the separation of Cork and Shannon Airports, until 2011.  I took the view at the time that it would be best to provide a reasonable period of time to enable the boards and management of these airports to address the very significant challenges facing the aviation market.  Accordingly, my conclusion was that the continuation of these boards would be in the best interests of all three State airports until I am in a position to decide on the issue of airport separation under the State Airports Act 2004.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	838	I can only comment on the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, which relate to vehicles illegally parked on public roads or in local authority car parks.  Section 101(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended, allows an authorised person to fix an immobilisation device (clamp) to a vehicle while it remains in the place where he finds it or to move it from that place to another place and fix an immobilisation device to it there, if the vehicle is parked in contravention of any prohibition or restriction under Sections 35, 36 and 36A of the Road Traffic Act 1994.  Section 101(b) also sets out the conditions for removal of an immobilization device, generally following payment of the prescribed charge.The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 to 2006 set out parking controls for the purposes of section 35.  Parking controls for the purposes of sections 36 and 36A are set out in any bye-laws made by a local authority under those provisions.  These regulations and bye-laws only apply in respect of vehicles illegally parked on public roads or in local authority car parks.

A public consultation with respect of such orders is not a statutory requirement.  However, such a public consultation was carried out prior to a previous alteration of the company's harbour limits in 2004 and the company has conducted a similar consultation in this instance.The procedure by which the consultation document was made available for public viewing for 21 days at the local Garda Station is the same as that followed with regard to the previous proposed alteration of the harbour limits in 2004.  The consultation period concluded on 9 September and the documentation has now been returned to me with a confirmation from the Gardaí that it was on public display from 19 August for a period of 21 days.  I have received a number of submissions in response to the consultation and will give due consideration to these before making my decision.The proposed alteration of the harbour limits would extend them to the area around the proposed location for a new port at Bremore.  However, a planning application for the new port has not been made as yet.  Any such application would follow all the usual planning consultations.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.New arrangements for the management and administration of regional and local road grants were introduced on 1st September 2009.  These arrangements were put in place on foot of the existing statutory framework which places responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads with local authorities.  From 1st September, last, the National Roads Authority was tasked to undertake the management of the Regional and Local Roads Investment Programme on behalf of my Department.  The National Roads Authority will recommend grant allocations for regional and local roads for 2010 and subsequent years, which will be subject to final approval by the Minister for Transport.  The 2010 grant allocations will be announced early in the New Year.

The 2009 subvention to both Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann has not been increased to compensate for the withdrawal of the fuel duty rebate. The growth in the subvention paid to Dublin Bus over the period since 1999 reflects the growth in the number of services, particularly peak hour services provided, increased labour and fuel costs in particular and fare increases over that period.The decision by Dublin Bus as part of its cost recovery plan, to reorganise its network to reflect changes in demand, based on 120 fewer buses is consistent with the conclusions in the Deloitte Report.  The Deloitte report concluded that the Dublin Bus fleet is adequate to meet current demand, and that fleet expansion was not an immediate issue.  Instead the Deloitte report concluded that the focus should be on optimising the existing network and extracting full value from the existing fleet.  I understand that Dublin Bus are taking account of the Deloitte findings in the redesign of the network.

The priority for the roads investment programme after the completion of the major interurban network will be the road schemes on the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.  Progress on these and other road schemes must be viewed in the context of the challenging financial times ahead.

A recent review of the travel trade regulations by CAR highlighted the need for reform of EU legislation in this area, as the existing regime no longer reflects the realities of the market place where an increasing number of holidaymakers are booking through online service providers who are not currently subject to the licensing and bonding requirements imposed on Travel Agents and Tour Operators.  In that context, my Department and CAR will engage in the stakeholder consultation process when it is launched. My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade & Employment would also have an interest in terms of consumer protection policies generally.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	854	Three subjects of European Arrest Warrants were released in 2008 by order of the High Court because the issuing authority failed, in each case, to collect the subjects within the statutory time limit. There were no processing delays on the part of the Irish authorities in relation to the cases and, in each instance, the High Court had ordered surrender.Under the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended, a person, whose surrender has been ordered by the High Court, must be surrendered to the requesting state within 10 days from the date the Order takes effect. The Act provides for an extension of the time limit in certain circumstances. The courts in this jurisdiction have ruled that applications for such extensions must be made to the courts and that the issuing authorities must show good reason why it was not possible to collect the subject within the time limit. In each of the three cases in question, the Irish Central Authority for the European Arrest Warrant notified the issuing authorities of the Order for surrender and the time limit in accordance with standard procedures. In each case, the issuing authority was unable to collect the subject within the statutory time limit. Following legal proceedings in each case, the courts ordered release of the subjects on the grounds that the reasons advanced by the issuing authorities for failure to collect within the time-limit were not sufficient. As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are, subject to the law and the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their functions and it is not open to me to make any comment in relation to these proceedings.However, I can say that the Central Authority has raised the issue of non-collection with the authorities of a particular Member State. In response, the authorities in the state concerned have assured the Irish authorities that subjects will be collected on time. The Central Authority will continue to monitor the situation and take action as appropriate.

In the event of negative recommendations from both agencies, or in the case of any third country national found to be illegally present in the State, a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999 is served on the person concerned which affords him/her an opportunity to avail of any one of three specified options. These three options are a) to leave the State voluntarily,  b) to consent to the making of a Deportation Order, c) to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.  In the case of refused asylum applicants a fourth option is available d) to apply for Subsidiary Protection.In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (prohibition of refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.  Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned.The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard to Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a Deportation Order.  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.Each asylum application received is considered on the basis of the facts, individual circumstances and merits of the case presented and a final decision is reached following a comprehensive examination and investigation of these facts, merits and circumstances taking full account of the political and human rights conditions prevailing in the person's country of return and the latest reports of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.In the event that temporary leave to remain in the State is refused by me, and I sign a Deportation Order, notice of such an order is then served either by registered post, or by hand, requiring the person concerned to present himself/herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date in order to make travel arrangements for his/her deportation from the State.  The enforcement of each deportation order is an operational matter for GNIB.Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 will be a key measure for achieving efficiencies in the asylum applications processing system itself and in establishing a more effective and streamlined removal process, as set out in Part 6 of the Bill.

His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person concerned was advised of his entitlement to appeal this determination to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but he did not do so.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 24 June 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.The Deputy might also wish to note that, on 15 July 2008, the person concerned, through his legal representative, sought to be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). This application was refused and the person concerned was notified of the refusal decision by letter dated 29 August 2008.

Such persons are advised, in writing, of their entitlement to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State at the same time as they are being advised of the formal refusal of their asylum application. Any Subsidiary Protection application made is considered in strict accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.In the event that an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State is refused, the position in the State of the unsuccessful applicant is then determined by reference to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. At this point a decision is made as to whether that person should become the subject of a Deportation Order or if, instead, they should be granted leave to remain in the State.It is not possible to provide a specific indication for the timeframe within which applications for Subsidiary Protection are determined. This is primarily because no two applications will be the same in terms of their complexity.

The policy document is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service (www.irishprisons.ie).  The policy is aimed at bringing about changes in offenders’ lives that reduce risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.  It forms an integral part of the wider range of interventions by criminal justice and community-based agencies.In addition, a new programme of group interventions for sex offenders was introduced in January 2009. The programme, "Building Better Lives", allows more responsive and flexible delivery to a greater number of offenders than heretofore. The new treatment programme will ensure that all sex offenders serving sentences of one year or more will have access to appropriate treatment.  This new programme replaced the Sex Offender Programme which ran from 1994 to 2008. Under that programme some 136 sex offenders completed what was an intensive eleven month programme.  When fully operational the new programme will allow for interventions to take place with up to 60 offenders. Whilst it is too early to evaluate take-up of the new programme I am confident that we will achieve a significant level of voluntary take-up of the interventions offered.Therapeutic interventions with sex offenders are delivered primarily through the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service. It is not possible to disaggregate the number of posts or funding specifically dedicated to sexual offending interventions.  However, the resources allocated to the Psychology Service have been increased substantially in recent years. Between 2002 and 2008, the staffing complement increased from 8 to the current level of 21.There is a comprehensive range of services available to sex offenders and any willing participant can be facilitated within the range of therapeutic interventions. These comprise notably one-to-one interventions, group interventions, community-based services and interventions available to prisoners generally.  Interventions by community-based services in 2009 include motivational enhancement groups provided by the Granada Institute in the Midlands and Wheatfield prisons and interventions with young sex offenders provided by the Northside Inter-Agency Project (NIAP) in St Patrick's Institution.  Sex offenders continue to benefit from other group programmes not specifically designed for sex offenders but addressing their needs. These include stress management, anger management and cognitive skills training. They also have access to visiting psychiatrists.With regard to female sex offenders, there is currently one in custody.  The small number at any one time does not allow delivery of group programmes such as the Exploring Better Lives programme but female offenders have access to the range of other interventions.  The new Irish Prison Service sex offender policy, the increase in resources to the Psychology Service and the new group programme highlight the commitment of my Department and the Irish Prison Service to working with sex offenders. There are no plans to reduce this level of commitment.The Probation Service, in partnership with the Granada Institute, runs the Lighthouse treatment programmes for sex offenders under Probation Service supervision. Currently there are three group programmes in operation. Two are based in Dublin and one in Cork. The programmes deal with offenders from all parts of the country. The Cork programme currently has attendees from Cork, Waterford, Louth, Tipperary and Kerry. The two Dublin programmes currently have attendees from Dublin, Monaghan, Mayo, Wexford, and Cavan. Each group programme has the capacity for eight offenders, giving a total of twenty four places.In addition to the group work programmes and in response to specific needs, the Lighthouse programme offers a limited number of individual places for sex offender treatment. Currently there are seven sex offenders receiving individual sex offender treatment. There are therefore 30 sex offenders currently attending Lighthouse sex offender treatment programmes.Year€2004300,0002005300,000 + 95,000*2006300,0002007300,0002008320,0002009395,000*This was a once off payment to meet 2003 and 2004 deficit.In 2005, at a cost of €10,000, the Probation Service commissioned Dr Sean Hammond and Dr Ethel Quoyle, Psychology Department U.C.C. to produce a practice manual and related training for Probation Officers supervising sex offenders in the community.

In that regard I can advise the Deputy that:Section 28 of the Sex Offender Act, 2001 requires a Court to consider the inclusion of a period of post release supervision when sentencing an offender on conviction of a scheduled sexual offence under the Act.Section 29(1) allows the Court to impose a sentence comprising of a sentence of imprisonment followed by a period after release during which the offender will be under the supervision of a probation officer. Section 29 also requires the offender to comply with any conditions of supervision specified in the sentence. The Probation Service records all Court orders made requiring the supervision of offenders sentenced under the Sex Offenders Act, 2001.The following is the breakdown of the number of sex offenders who, over the last 5 years, were subject to post release supervision by the Probation Service.YearNumber of Sex Offenders released onto supervision2004120058200612200720200826Total67To date 17 offenders have been released from custody onto supervision this year with a further 11 expected to be released onto supervision prior to the end of 2009.Section 33 of the 2001 Act deals with non-compliance of the conditions of supervision as a summary offence prosecutable in the District Court.   Section 33 was amended by Section 13(c)(4) of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, to allow for the prosecution of such a summary offence by a probation officer.  To date, no offender has been convicted under Section 33 of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 as amended.I would add that in managing these cases Probation officers work closely with the Gardaí and other partner agencies to ensure the cooperation and compliance by the offender with supervision, in the interests of community safety.  In conjunction with the Gardaí and others, Probation officers, by and large, successfully engage with the offenders concerned and ensure their compliance with supervision through ongoing motivation and monitoring.

There was a consultative process following the publication of that document and I am now considering the views expressed as part of that consultative process.At the same time I announced the establishment of a Project Board, led by the Probation Service, to examine specific possibilities as well as the implementation of electronic monitoring (EM) more generally in this jurisdiction.  I received an interim report from the Project Board in June which recommended that a pilot project be initiated in order to test EM technology in this jurisdiction and assess its value for money in the management of offenders.  I await the final report from the Board — which is due shortly — and which will inform the decision(s) on using EM technology here for a pilot period.With regard to the cost, detailed costings will only become known once a tender process has been completed and evaluated for best value for the taxpayer. The Deputy can rest assured that I will balance the cost to the public purse against the added value for offender management generally and ultimately the benefits for public safety.

St Patrick's Institution is the designated detention centre for young male offenders aged between 16 and 21 years of age.  In the long term the Irish Youth Justice Service will take responsibility for the detention facilities for all boys under 18 years.In the interim the separation of children and young adults in St. Patrick's Institution has taken place in so far as is possible given the physical limitations of the St. Patrick's site.  The Special School (B Division) was opened in April 2007 specifically for this purpose.  It has a bed capacity of 44 and is self contained.  Inmates aged 16 and 17 now have a residential area, communal dining area, and education, work training and recreational areas that are separate from young adults.  This has created a separate and enhanced regime for them.When the number of such prisoners exceeds 44, priority is given to the 16-year-olds. Those 17-year-olds who cannot be accommodated in the Special School are accommodated in the drug-free D Division of the main institution.  A small number of 17-year-olds are kept in the young adult part of the institution because of their specific individual needs.  These include sex offenders and vulnerable inmates who for their own protection are accommodated separately.In March 2008, the Government approved the development of new national children detention facilities on the Oberstown campus near Lusk, Co. Dublin. This facility will accommodate all under 18 year olds who have been ordered to be detained by the Courts. The project is currently at the design stage and it is expected that the tendering process for construction should take place in 2010. Construction is expected to be undertaken in phases with the first phase scheduled to be completed by 2012.  On completion of the first phase it is anticipated that any 16 or 17 year old male ordered to be detained by the Courts will no longer be detained in facilities under the aegis of the Irish Prison Service.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that tendering for the construction of the new facilities will be subject to Government approval and to the necessary funding being made available.

Recidivism rates are typically established through one-off studies of samples of offenders based on individual records of imprisonment, conviction or offending.  The Irish Prison Service keeps records of periods in custody for every prisoner which allow calculation of re-imprisonment rates by type of offence, including sex offences. However, these do not allow calculation of a comprehensive rate of re-offending that includes non-custodial sentences.Recently, my Department funded an independent study by UCD of the sex offender programme run by the Irish Prison Service between 1994 and 2008. This examined re-offending rates of a sample of 248 sex offenders based on prison and Garda records. It found a re-offending rate of 8.1 percent for sexual offending over an average of 6.2 years.

Assessment is an aspect of that practice.  The procedures include a notification of release to the relevant Child Care Manager within the HSE.  Contained in the following table is the breakdown of the number of sex offenders who, over the last 5 years, were subject to post release supervision by the Probation Service:YearNumber of Sex Offenders released onto supervision2004120058200612200720200826Total67To date seventeen offenders have been released from custody onto supervision this year with a further eleven expected to be released onto supervision prior to the end of 2009.The widescale use of a static risk assessment instrument, Risk Matrix 2000 (RM 2000) in assessments has commenced this year.  However, since March 2008, the combination of RM 2000 and SA 2007 assessments (a dynamic risk assessment, Stable and Acute 2007) has been used with a limited number of offenders.  These offenders were identified as posing particular concerns about risk and the majority were identified prior to release from custody onto probation supervision.  To date approximately 60 such assessments have been completed.Of the first 44 assessments completed by June 2009, 22 (50%) had been completed on offenders either prior to or immediately following release from custody onto supervision.  The remaining 22 had been completed on offenders at the pre-sentence report stage or were already on supervision in the community.  Once implemented nationally in 2010 the RM 2000 will guide the level of intervention and regulation required and the SA 2007 will guide the nature of that intervention.

Dedicated victim interview suites have been established in a number of locations throughout the country and are used by An Garda Síochána to take video recordings of statements from victims of sexual crime.  The suites are not attached to Garda Stations, and it would not be appropriate for reasons of confidentiality to give precise details of their locations.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	882	I can inform the Deputy that the Probation Service deals with sex offenders referred by the Court following a guilty finding or plea to a specific sex offence or offences.  To assist in its supervision of sex offenders the Probation Service, in partnership with the Granada Institute, runs the Lighthouse treatment programmes for sex offenders under its supervision.  Currently there are three group programmes in operation.  Two are based in Dublin and one in Cork.  The programmes deal with offenders from all parts of the country.  The Cork programme currently has attendees from Cork, Waterford, Louth, Tipperary and Kerry.  The two Dublin programmes currently have attendees from Dublin, Monaghan, Mayo, Wexford, and Cavan.Each group programme has the capacity for eight offenders, giving a total of twenty four places.  Currently there are seven offenders attending the Cork programme and eight attending each of the two Dublin based programmes, giving a current total of twenty three offenders nationally attending Lighthouse group treatment programmes.  For reasons of efficiency and responsivity the programmes run on a rolling group basis, taking in new participants following assessment of suitability and as vacancies arise when others complete treatment.  An eighth offender is expected to join the Cork programmes in the next week or two.In addition to the group work programmes and in response to specific needs, the Lighthouse programme offers a limited number of individual places for sex offender treatment.  Currently there are seven sex offenders receiving individual sex offender treatment.  There are therefore 30 sex offenders currently attending Lighthouse sex offender treatment programmes.In addition to the Lighthouse treatment programmes, individual offenders on supervision may attend for sex offender treatment with individual therapists or at privately run centres such as the Granada Institute or centres such as Cosc in the North West run by the Health Service Executive.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	883	I can inform the Deputy that under the Intergovernmental Agreement on North South Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters of 2005, a cross border justice committee, the Public Protection Advisory Group, has been established to promote public safety on an all island basis.  The committee is jointly chaired by the Directors of the Probation Services of the two jurisdictions.  One of the priority targets of this group for 2009 is the introduction of all island system for the assessment of sex offenders. Best practice indicates that different jurisdictions as well as different agencies within jurisdictions should use the same risk assessment instruments so as to support effective communication.  This initiative is led within this jurisdiction by the Probation Service and An Garda Síochána.  To ensure close collaboration, there is a cross jurisdictional representation on the appropriate lead committees.Furthermore, in 2006, Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to share information on persons travelling between this jurisdiction, Northern Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.  This is for the purposes of the protection of the public from the risks presented by sex offenders and the investigation of serious sexual offences and covers any information necessary to achieve these purposes.Subsequently, in 2008 An Garda Síochána and the PSNI signed an agreement on the sharing of personal data in relation to the investigation of sexual offences and the monitoring of sex offenders, which formalised the exchanges of information which had always taken place.The Probation Service is working closely with An Garda Síochána and has completed initial training in a static risk assessment instrument, Risk Matrix 2000 (RM 2000).  This will be coupled with a dynamic risk assessment, Stable and Acute 2007 (SA 2007).  The combination of RM2000 and SA 2007 is the sex offender risk assessment system currently used by Probation and Police services in Northern Ireland, Scotland and in various parts of England and Wales.The RM 2000 is a static risk assessment instrument designed to estimate the likelihood of sexual or non-sexual violent re-offending amongst convicted sex offenders over the following five, ten and fifteen year periods.  The instrument has been extensively used across the United Kingdom since 2000 and was validated in 2008 by the Scottish Executive, based on a population of 1000 convicted sex offenders.  The Probation Service and An Garda Síochána have in 2008/9 undertaken a programme of staff training in the RM 2000 instrument.  The instrument is currently being applied to sex offenders under the supervision of the Probation Service and subject to the Garda notification requirements.SA 2007 is a dynamic sex offender risk assessment instrument.  This dynamic instrument is responsive to the current risks posed by individual sex offenders. Further, it identifies key risk factors relevant to the particular individual so that risk management strategies can be more individually targeted.  It also provides a warning system for imminent relapse. Training for an appropriate number of Probation staff in the application of this instrument is scheduled later this year.In addition to the evidence based sex offender risk assessment instruments, Probation Officers supervising offenders in the community are encouraged to use evidence based approaches to their interventions.  In 2005 the Probation Service commissioned Dr Sean Hammond and Dr Ethel Quoyle, Psychology Department U.C.C. to produce a practice manual and related training for Probation Officers supervising sex offenders in the community.I should also advise that the Lighthouse sex offender treatment programme funded by my Department through the Probation Service which is currently dealing with thirty sex offenders under Probation supervision uses the Good Lives Model (Tony Ward) as the key component in its therapeutic interventions with offenders.

The Deputy's attention is drawn to the provisions of section 12 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which provides that it is an offence for a person, intentionally or recklessly, to administer or cause another to take, a substance which he or she knows is capable of interfering substantially with that other person's bodily functions, where he or she knows that the person does not consent to that action taking place.  The section also provides that a substance capable of inducing unconsciousness or sleep is deemed capable of interfering substantially with bodily functions.

The Board consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the Attorney General, a practising barrister nominated by the Bar Council, a practising solicitor nominated by the Law Society and not more than 3 persons nominated by the Minister.Section 17 of the 1995 Act specifies that serving judges are not subject to the JAAB procedure.  Except in the case of serving judges, all candidates are considered by the Board.  It should be noted that the Board publishes an annual report on the number of vacancies considered and lists the names of the persons who have been appointed to judicial office following recommendations by the Board.Since 1995 a total of 151 persons have been nominated by Government for appointment by the President.  Records of representations received are only readily available since 1997.  Since then, a total of 42 representations have been received by the Minister of the day on behalf of persons who wish to be nominated to the judiciary.  In total since 1997, 4 persons on behalf of whom representations were made were nominated for appointment following recommendation by the Board.

At the end of August 2009, RIA was accommodating 6,815 in 55 centres across 21 counties, including the accommodation centre at Clare Lodge, Ennis, Co. Clare.RIA's current contract with Clare Lodge ends on 29 September, 2009 and RIA has chosen not to renew it.  The non-renewal does not come about because of any concerns of RIA about performance of the contract.  Rather, the closure comes about following a necessary review by RIA as to how it can reconcile its anticipated accommodation demands with the limited financial resources it has.  As part of the logistical operation of effecting the closure of the accommodation centre, residents are being transferred to other centres within the RIA accommodation portfolio.  This has had to be phased over several weeks and it was not always feasible to give residents as much advance notice of their new centres as would normally be possible were a closure not involved.

At the end of August 2009, RIA was accommodating 6,815 in 55 centres across 21 counties.  Since April 2000, the RIA has provided accommodation for over 53,000 asylum seekers.The 55 centres in the RIA portfolio consist of 49 direct provision centres, 4 self-catering centres and 2 reception centres the day to day management of all 55 centres is carried out by private companies under contract to RIA.  Seven of the centres are state owned, i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State, while the remaining 48 centres are commercially owned. 85% of all bed capacity is located within the commercially owned centres.In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, the RIA does not lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather it ‘contracts-in' a comprehensive range of services, which include accommodation, catering, management, housekeeping, laundry, etc., for a fixed period of time.   RIA regularly places newspaper advertisements seeking expressions of interest from those who are capable of providing this range of services.  The last such advertisement was in February, 2009.  No newcomers are prevented from coming into the market.  The RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in relation to such contracts, in respect of which negotiations can take place with a number of commercial entities.The financial outturn of RIA for the last three years is outlined in the following table:YearNo. of CentresNo. of asylum seekersTotal expenditure€m2006545,48978.728200763 (includes Programme Refugee Centre)6,62583.262200860 (includes Programme Refugee Centre)7,00291.472The total expenditure above includes additional transport costs, utility (gas, electricity, water etc.) costs in respect of the seven State owned centres, recoupment of accommodation costs to the HSE in respect of unaccompanied minors, and other miscellaneous costs.  Specifically in respect of the privately owned and operated centres, an estimate of the total costs paid for each of the last three years is:  2006 — €66.92m; 2007 — €70.77m; 2008 — €77.71m.In this regard, the Deputy should note that on 21 October, 2008 the Government agreed to a new round of Value For Money (VFM) reviews for the period 2009-2011.  One of the expenditure programmes on the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice to be the subject of such a review is the spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation.  As with all such VFM reviews, it has a steering committee, comprising officials from my Department and the Department of Finance and an independent Chairperson.  The review is currently under way and is nearing completion.  The result of this VFM review will be presented to the Oireachtas upon completion.

The sector has appointed Mr Padraig White as Chairperson of RRAI and I expect to receive the first implementation and verification report from him later this month.  I understand that this report will contain details of the progress made in implementing the Code across the mixed trading sector as well as action taken in response to specific complaints, including those made by the National Off-Licence Association (NOffLA).  I intend to publish the report on my Department's web site in due course.

I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.Regarding the PULSE system I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda stations on the PULSE network has been increased to 347 locations including all Divisional, District Headquarters and Garda stations operating on a 24 hour basis.  This equates to approximately half (49.4%) of the total number of 703 Garda locations nationwide, and over 85% of all incidents are captured at these locations.There is no ongoing delay with the rollout of PULSE to all Garda Stations. Indeed, it was never envisaged by Garda Authorities that PULSE would be available at every location.  The extension of the PULSE system to additional locations is reviewed on an ongoing basis by Garda management and additional stations are added to the network on a case by case basis as and when business requirements dictate.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), which is based in Castlebar, allows Gardaí from both networked and non-networked stations to log the information over the telephone with the GISC without the need to return to their station, thus releasing Garda resources for visible, frontline policing across our communities.The total development cost of the PULSE project was €61.3 million and covers the period up to the final release of the system which was rolled out in 2001.  In addition, the annual maintenance and upgrade costs for PULSE from 2001 to the end of 2006 totalled €64.39 million. By way of background, the figure of €64.39m above includes replacement of the Pulse hardware and major upgrades to the PULSE software as part of the Garda Pulse stabilisation programme which was completed in 2006. In addition, a range of upgrades and modifications have been carried out to the system to support changes arising from new legislation, additional functionality etc.  It also includes costs associated with the extension of the PULSE system to new locations and to the set-up of the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC) in Castlebar and the Vetting Unit in Thurles.  Contractor costs totalled approximately €40m while €10m was spent on hardware along with €14m for various software licences.Following the completion of PULSE stabilisation and a programme of maintenance and hardware upgrades in 2006, PULSE was integrated with the Garda National Immigration Bureau Information System (GNIB-IS) and the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) and other niche systems to form a new combined IT system to be referred to as the Garda Information System (GIS).   For this reason, from 2007 onwards it is not possible to identify any expenditure specific to PULSE as all maintenance and upgrade work is carried out on the GIS as opposed to individual IT systems.

Other aspects of the Protocol are being implemented administratively in the context of the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland — which was published on 10 June this year — and through engagement with the Governmental and non-governmental organisations in this area.However, it will be necessary to ratify the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime prior to ratification of the Protocol.  The necessary legislation is contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as recently amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  However one further aspect of the Convention requires legislation i.e. establishing jurisdiction over money laundering offences.  The necessary provision is included in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering) Bill which was published on 28 July 2009.

Funding is also provided by the Health Service Executive.  The funding covered the costs associated with running the Programme, including salaries, travel and subsistence, staff training and administration.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I propose to take Questions Nos. 624, 635 and 721 together.I have already set out the background to the closure of the Harristown House facility on numerous occasions in this House but perhaps it is worth repeating that the overall conclusion of the independent review into this facility was that the centre was in crisis. There were serious indications (e.g. HR, financial and quality of service) that the organisation had become dysfunctional the results of this review indicated that the organisation as it currently stood was no longer viable. In addition there were concerns expressed over the quality of care and rehabilitation. When the details of the report were brought to the attention of the Board of Management of the limited company which ran the facility they too shared the concerns raised in the report and they took the unanimous view that the preferred course of action was to close down the facility, take time to reflect on the learning and develop a vision and plan for a new way forward.The Probation Service of my Department works daily with communities across the country supporting and mentoring its core client group to stay away from crime but it is not a primary drug treatment service provider.  That said, in the 1970s, at a time when State and voluntary addiction services were limited and particularly difficult to access for offenders, the Probation Service initiated the provision of funding to support or develop services for offenders to fill an identified gap in services for this distinct client grouping.Deputies will, I am sure, acknowledge that there has been significant  development in HSE addiction services as well as other services over the past twenty years. This includes the development of harm reduction policies and practices and a range of enhanced options and provision, with  improved access generally.  The HSE is now established as the principal provider and funding body of medical and non-medical addiction services for both illicit drug and alcohol use delivered through its Social Inclusion Services.Of course, the Probation Service does recognise that addiction is a contributory factor in re-offending and that investment in addiction services to meet specific criminal justice needs may be necessary in certain specific circumstances.  For that reason, the Probation Service currently provides funding to 19 addiction centres nationally to address specific addiction treatment needs.  The funding commitment in 2009 to this group of addiction centres is €1,978,000.  This funding allows for the provision of 384 programme places, as well as some counselling on demand in both prisons and the community as well as support and aftercare programmes.  Probation Service management information indicates that this level of provision is sufficient in meeting requirements over and above HSE and other addiction services provision.I should add that the Probation Service is currently reviewing its arrangements for the funding of drug treatment places. To that end the Service, in the interests of better coordination and integrated provision, is working closely with the HSE.  The primary intention of this collaboration with the HSE is to bring about greater  co-operation, co-ordination and to clarify  appropriate tasks and roles with the aim of delivering effective, efficient  client centred services that best protect the public purse.Turning to the proposals received from the Probation Service in relation to the setting up of a new residential addiction treatment facility at Harristown House. As part of the consideration of the proposal my Department  sought and received an evaluation from  the Probation Service of anticipated Service needs for the core client group of the Service  in the surrounding counties for addiction treatment facilities.  The considered view of Probation Service management is that the provision of an additional residential treatment facility would not assist the Service further at this time in dealing with the addiction issues in the West, North West and Westmeath Probation Service region. Based on that needs assessment it is not proposed to open a new addiction treatment facility at Harristown House.Finally let me say that my first priority is to ensure that my Department, through the Probation Service, continues to fund projects in the community that add value to the core criminal justice focussed work of the Service and which allow for the strengthening of community based partnerships. It is my intention to continue to fund a range of addiction and other projects into 2010 having regard to overall budgetary constraints.  This will be done against the background of some €18.001 m. having been allocated in 2009 to providing funding to community based projects which has benefited over 50 such projects.  Within that overall allocation 11% (almost €2m) will be distributed to the aforementioned  19 addiction treatment projects around the country.

The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place was recently increased from one to five years and the Garda Síochána were also given extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.   These measures were introduced in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.In tandem with those measures, the importation and sale of samurai swords was also prohibited, though exceptions have been made for collectors and genuine enthusiasts.  These measures only came into force last month and it will take time to see the results.  While there are no plans at present to introduce an amnesty for knives, the whole area of knives and knife crime is kept under constant review.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I am informed by the Garda authorities that, subject to the availability of personnel, Ballinrobe Garda Station is open during the following hours:Opening HoursMonday – Friday11.00am – 1.00pm8.00pm – 9.00pmSaturday11.00am – 1.00pmSunday12.00noon – 1.00pmThere are no current plans to increase the opening hours of Ballinrobe Garda Station.  Ballinrobe Garda Station is located in the Claremorris Garda District in Co. Mayo. The personnel strength of Ballinrobe Garda Station, on the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 10. The increase of opening hours at Ballinrobe Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who in the view of the Garda authorities may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	901	I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following a number of recent incidents of crimes committed using knives in the Mayo Garda Division, a number of arrests were made.  The persons arrested were subsequently charged and are currently before the courts.  While local Garda Management is concerned at recent developments, it is of the view that knife crime is not especially prevalent in this Division.  In monitoring crime trends, the Divisional Officer and his senior management team have tailored the policing arrangements in the Division to take account of particular issues which arise on an ongoing basis.Policing measures are in place to identify areas where disorderly conduct is likely to occur, and resources are deployed accordingly.  Any person suspected of carrying an offensive weapon, especially a knife, is liable to be searched.  Areas where groups of young people tend to congregate are subject to regular patrols and increased Garda attention.Areas identified as public order hot-spots within the Division are the subject of targeted policing, including strict enforcement of the relevant legislative provisions.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge notices or initiating criminal proceedings.  Any persons found engaging in such behaviour will continue to be dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.  The Divisional Drugs Unit has been especially pro-active in carrying out searches of suspects entering and leaving night clubs.Legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is extremely robust and heavy penalties are in place.  The Garda Commissioner last year made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda Síochána have been given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords have been banned from importation and sale, though exceptions have been made for collectors and martial artists.  Last February, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda Síochána to inform and educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	902	The costs to my Department in relation to delivering asylum services in 2008 are included in the following table under the following subheads of the Justice vote: D1 (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service); D2 (Refugee Legal Service); and D4 (Accommodation Asylum Seekers).SubheadCost €MSubhead D165.9Subhead D28.9Subhead D491.5Total166.3The above figures for 2008 are provisional and may be subject to change prior to publication of the 2008 Appropriation Accounts.The Deputy should note that the costs incurred under subhead D1 include the total cost of running the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) which includes the delivery of services across Asylum, Immigration, Naturalisation and Visa areas.  The cost of accommodating asylum applicants accounts for the bulk of the expenditure on asylum by my Department, as can be seen from the table above. In this regard, the direct provision system is an efficient means of accommodating asylum seekers. If this system was not in place the cost to the State of accommodating asylum seekers would be higher.Various efficiency and cost reduction measures continue to be implemented across INIS with a view to reducing the costs associated with asylum applications. On the application processing side, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) keep processing times and scheduling arrangements under ongoing review with a view to limiting the amount of time applicants have to wait for a recommendation or decision, all of which impact on direct provision costs.Other efficiency and cost reduction measures being pursued to reduce asylum costs include:implementation of strategies aimed at reducing asylum application numbers and tackling the various abuses of the asylum process;maximising the number of asylum cases transferred to other European States for processing under the Dublin II Regulation;an increased focus on the return of failed applicants to their countries of origin through deportations and voluntary return;implementation of the Government decision dated the 3 February, 2009 in relation to achieving an 8% reduction in spending on professional fees;engagement with contractors for asylum seeker accommodation to achieve an 8% reduction in Reception and Integration (RIA) expenditure. The RIA anticipates that these savings will be reflected in RIA's 2009 outturn;completion of a Government agreed Value for Money (VFM) Review of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation.  The result of this VFM review will be presented to the Oireachtas when it is completed;consolidating shared services related activities across INIS and redeploying resources to processing areas;strategies aimed at reducing the delays and costs associated with Judicial Review proceedings, such as greater use of in-house training, expertise and precedents, resulting in less use of counsel; ongoing review of practices and procedures and quality-proofing of decisions.Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 will be a key measure for achieving efficiencies in the asylum applications processing system itself; for establishing a more effective and streamlined removal process; and for tackling abuses which the asylum and immigration system have to contend with, including apparent abuses of the judicial review system. The Bill comprehensively reforms and simplifies the current asylum system through the introduction of a single procedure for the investigation of all grounds put forward by applicants for protection. It is envisaged that there will be significant reductions in processing times upon enactment of the Bill, which will significantly reduce the costs involved in the asylum process.

The persons concerned should write to the General Immigration Division, INIS, which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, providing full details and documentation of their current circumstances and of their future intentions with regard to remaining in Ireland in order for the matter to be considered further.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	904	An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in November 2005.  All applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is at an advanced stage and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	905	The recommendations referred to relate to the alleged leaking of official material from Garda sources to the media relating to a deceased person. The full text of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's report in relation to this matter is available on its website.  The report recommends to the Garda Commissioner that supervisory ranks of An Garda Síochána should regularly monitor the use of PULSE to ensure that members adhere to their legal and disciplinary obligations with regard to its proper use. The Ombudsman Commission also recommends that suitable measures be put in place by the Garda authorities to ensure audit trails of the usage of PULSE and any other official information systems can always be accurate and verifiable.With regard to Pulse, An Garda Síochána have detailed procedures and instructions in place on the operation of the Pulse system. The Pulse system incorporates an accurate audit system which records all record creations and updates made on the system.  The audit record includes the date and time when the update on the system took place and contains details of the user signed onto the system at that time.  Audit-trails also record all inquires made on the core items of interest on the PULSE system including Person and Vehicle.  Audit records are written at the time the associated transaction took place.  These audit records can only be accessed centrally and are not available or visible to the users.In response to the report, a review to consider the matters raised and identify options for enhanced usage of the PULSE Audit data in respect of the monitoring of data access has been conducted by the Gardaí.  Specific proposals in this regard have been formulated and are presently under consideration by senior Garda management. Under these proposals an ‘Exceptional activity level report' and related business process has been advanced which will highlight to Garda Management specific PULSE records which are subject to a high level of data access activity occurring within a defined period.  This new functionality will be included in the next major release of PULSE.

The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units.  A member of the local Community Policing Unit is specifically allocated to this area.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge notices or initiating criminal proceedings.  Any persons found engaging in such behaviour will continue to be dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.I am informed that local Garda management has arranged for the local community Garda to contact the persons referred to by the Deputy regarding their concerns and to ensure that any future incidents of anti-social behaviour are reported to local Gardaí for action.  Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and crimes against property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	907	The person concerned applied for asylum on 25 June 2004.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the individual concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 27 July 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	913	The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. An applicant for criminal legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid and the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means.The courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. The Deputy will appreciate that eligibility for legal aid in criminal cases is determined by the Judge hearing the case and that I have no function in this regard.  The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and a disproportionate amount of staff resources would be required to compile it.  Expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme has totalled €41.7m up to 31 August 2009.  My Department is currently considering a number of measures to strengthen the provisions for the granting of criminal legal aid and I will be bringing proposals to Government in this regard as soon as possible.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	914	At the outset, it should be borne in mind that not all non-EU citizens are required to be in possession of a valid Irish visa prior to arriving at a port of entry to the State.  In cases where an individual is visa required, it is the general policy of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to advise persons proposing to enter the State on a short stay ‘visit' visa to have secured the appropriate medical/travel insurance for the duration of the proposed stay.  This is an advisory and not a mandatory requirement in order to be considered for such a visa.  In such cases, the risk that the applicant presents of becoming a burden on public funds or public resources will be assessed as part of the determination process of the visa application.The position as regards a long term stay, that is a duration exceeding 90 days differs somewhat, in that such applicants are required to have the appropriate medical insurance in place.  The reason for such a requirement is that there is an onus on the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer that they will not become a burden on public funds or public resources in the event that a long term visa is granted.

Appeals are heard by an Appeal Tribunal. The Tribunal is paid on a case by case basis. Appointment is made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform subject to terms conditions and remuneration as he/she may determine with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The term of the Tribunal is at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Appointments were made following advertisements placed in the papers by the Irish Prison Service. Members must be barristers or solicitors of at least seven years standing.The Mental Health Review Board (under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006)This statutory independent body reviews the detention of patients at "designated centres" (of which the Central Mental Hospital (CMH) is currently the only one) who have been referred there arising from a decision by the Courts that they are unfit to stand trial or found to be not guilty of an offence by reason of insanity.The Review Board has established and maintains a panel of solicitors and law firms who satisfy the necessary criteria to provide legal services in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006. To be considered for placement on the panel, a solicitor or law firm must submit a completed application form for evaluation. The principal conditions an applicant must satisfy are the following:1. hold a current practising certificate from the Law Society of Ireland;2. be a practising solicitor who has had not less than three years' experience as a practising solicitor ending immediately before application;3. have professional indemnity insurance to cover an individual claim of up to €2.2million; and4. comply with Tax Clearance procedures.Further information concerning the criteria for applying to join the legal representatives panel of the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board is outlined on the website of Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board — www.mhclrb.ie — Legal Aid Scheme.There are currently twenty-nine solicitors appointed to the legal representatives panel.  The Review Board monitors the position on an ongoing basis.  The Panel will be reviewed formally by the Review Board every three years or as considered necessary by the Review Board.Garda Discipline PanelRegulations 25 and 34 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 214 of 2007) provide for the appointment by the Garda Commissioner of Presiding Officers of boards of inquiry and Chairpersons of Appeal Boards respectively.  Appointees must be drawn from a panel of judges of the District Court, or practising barristers or solicitors of not less than ten years' standing nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In June 2007 the then Minister made the first nominations to the panel.  After consultation with the President of the District Court, 10 judges were nominated to the panel.  All practising barristers and solicitors of ten years standing were invited via the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society to apply for nomination.  Following confirmation of their status by the Bar Council or Law Society respectively, the Minister nominated 250 lawyers to the panel.  In June 2008 applications for nomination were sought in the same way, and I made further nominations in November 2008.  There are now 351 persons on the panel, including 10 judges.  Further nominations to the panel will be made as the need arises.Private Security AuthorityThe Private Security Authority awarded a contract to Holmes O'Malley Sexton, Solicitors, Limerick following a tendering process in December 2008.  The term of the contract is for a period of three years.  They provide legal advice and assistance to the Board and CEO in the exercise of their statutory functions and responsibilities.The Legal Aid BoardTo assist it in fulfilling its functions under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board maintains two panels of solicitors under its Private Practitioner Scheme and also a panel of barristers under the terms of an agreement with the Bar Council.Under its Private Practitioner Scheme, the Board operates two separate panels to deal with Circuit Court and District Court cases. The existing Circuit Court Panel is in operation for three years after commencing on 1 October, 2006. The term of this panel has been extended to run to the end of this year and, pending its finalisation, new solicitors are not being considered for inclusion on the current panel. Solicitors interested in being included on a future panel should apply in writing to the Board and interviews will be conducted with the applicants with those found to be suitable being added to the panel as appropriate.The existing District Court Panel is in operation for three years after commencing on 1 May, 2008. A solicitor can now apply in writing to be added to this panel. Their application will be considered and subject to the decision of the Board, will be added to the panel if they fulfil the Board's standard requirements, including the requirement that they hold a practising certificate, appropriate indemnity insurance and possess a current tax clearance certificate.The Legal Aid Board maintains a panel of barristers under the terms of the Bar Council Agreement with this panel in continuous operation facilitating a barrister to apply at any time to be considered for inclusion. An interested barrister should apply in the first instance by submitting an application to the Bar Council. Subject to consideration and the barrister satisfying the Board's requirements, the Bar Council notify the Legal Aid Board and the barrister will be added to the panel as appropriate.Any solicitors or barristers interested in being included in any of the above panels may enquire further on the matter through the Board's Legal Services Section based in its Headquarters in Cahirciveen.Criminal Legal AidSolicitors and barristers who wish to operate under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must be on a criminal legal aid panel as provided for in the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 and Regulations, 1965 to 2003. The barristers' panel is maintained by my officials and each County Registrar maintains a solicitors' panel for his/her county.Each panel lasts for one year from 1 December in any year to 30 November the following year.  The procedure for barristers is that they must inform the Bar Council that they are willing to accept instruction in cases where the defendant has been granted a certificate for free legal aid by the courts. The Bar Council then informs my officials who request the Tax Clearance Certificate from the counsel before adding his/her name to the panel.  Similar requirements apply to solicitors, where solicitors who hold Fitness to Practice Certificates from the Law Society apply to County Registrars to have their name included on the Solicitors' Panel for the relevant County.  They must also provide a tax clearance certificate.Refugee Legal ServiceThe Refugee Legal Service maintains a panel of solicitors and a panel of barristers in private practice to submit appeals, in certain cases, on behalf of legally aided asylum applicants to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and to represent them before the Tribunal.Applications to the solicitors' panel are made to the Legal Services Unit of the Refugee Legal Service, and applications to the barristers' panel are made through the Bar Council to the Legal Services Unit.  The Board's website includes information for interested persons on who to contact.  In both cases, applications are considered as they are received and are assessed in relation to suitable training and experience.Data Protection CommissionerA competition is currently being conducted with a view to establishing a panel of at least three up to a maximum of five service providers with proven capacity to provide the full scope of legal services required by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. Full details concerning this competition can found in the notice that was published on www.etenders.gov.ie on 2 September, 2009.The Equality TribunalThe Equality Tribunal has an in-house Solicitor who provides the Director with specialist legal advices. Barristers are engaged on an occasional, specialist and case-by-case basis. There is no formal panel in place for such engagements as the work is highly specialised. Practitioners are briefed by the Legal Advisor on the basis of their specialist knowledge and availability.The Irish Human Rights CommissionThe Irish Human Rights Commission has no legal panel for solicitors. It has a legal panel for barristers which was established in 2004 at which time it placed notices in the Law Library asking counsel with human rights expertise to forward CVs to the Commission and address certain criteria. A panel was then established which has been updated over time. The process for getting onto this panel involves a barrister sending a CV to the Commission and setting out why they wish to be placed on the Commission's panel.Office of the Refugee Applications CommissionerA Presenting Panel of legally qualified persons was established by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in early 2009 to represent the Commissioner at appeals hearings before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  A competition was conducted in 2008 to select suitable candidates for placement on the Panel. The competition was advertised in national daily newspapers in October 2008. In addition, details of the competition were supplied to the Bar Council and Law Society of Ireland. Furthermore, detailed information and the relevant application form were uploaded to the website of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (www.orac.ie) on 2 October, 2008.  Following a short-listing process and interviews the Panel was established. It is not proposed at the present time to form another Presenting Panel as the work of the present Panel is not completed.

Consequently it is not operationally practical to set limits for the number of prisoners held within the prison system. There are contingency plans in place in all of our prisons to deal with peak population numbers. This Government has been engaged in a major prisons capital programme which has seen 1400 additional spaces introduced over the last 12 years, including Castlerea, Cloverhill, Limerick, the Midlands and the Dóchas Centre. A new 100 space accommodation block recently opened in Castlerea. Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 450 prison spaces during 2009 by means of:a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners;a new block in Wheatfield which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners;opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners.

The procedure is laid out in the District Court (Small Claims Procedure) Rules, 1997 & 1999.The service is provided by District Court offices and is designed to handle consumer claims cheaply without the need to engage legal representation.  It provides a useful cost effective service for consumers.  The types of claims dealt with under the procedure are:a claim for goods or services bought for private use from someone selling them in course of a business;a claim for minor damage to property (but excluding personal injuries);a claim for the non-return of a rent deposit for certain kinds of rented properties.However, the administrative manner in which claims are handled means not every type of case is suitable for inclusion.   Excluded from the procedure are claims arising from:a hire-purchase agreement;a breach of a leasing agreement;debts.I am currently considering proposals to extend the small claims procedure to businesses in certain circumstances which I hope to be in a position to finalise as soon as possible.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	920	All of the sections on firearms contained in Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have been commenced with the exception of the prohibition on the personal importation of firearms.  This measure will be addressed in the coming months in tandem with the transposition of the new EU Weapons Directive.  In addition, the outstanding firearms related sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 have also been commenced.As the Deputy will appreciate, in my role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my main priorities in relation to firearms are public safety and the control of firearms.  The two Acts already mentioned, which were debated extensively by the Oireachtas, introduce a range of measures in relation to firearms licensing such as the requirement that applicants have provided secure accommodation for their firearms, that they prove their identity, provide the names of two referees and give consent to medical enquiries though such enquiries will only be made where necessary.A major aspect of these reforms is the introduction of a new three year licence to replace the old one year licence, where all firearms certificates expired each year, on 31 July.  To manage the transition phase, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act contained a provision to extend the certificates which would have normally expired on 31 July 2009.  These licence extensions range from three to eleven months and the Garda Commissioner wrote to each licence holder to inform the holder of the extension he had been granted.  The shortest of these extensions will expire on 31 October 2009.Because of the new arrangements, the ‘one year licence' no longer exists and consequently could not be issued during the months of August or September. Prospective applicants, however, can apply for the new three year licenses and the first of these will issue in the coming weeks.  The Garda Commissioner recently published on the Garda website ‘Guidelines as to the Practical Application and Operation of the Firearms Acts, 1925-2009' and I believe these guidelines will prove invaluable in assisting members of the Garda Síochána and the public alike by bringing clarity and transparency to firearms licensing.

Both were refused by the Visa Officer on 25 May 2009 for the following reasons:1. The evidence of finances submitted was deemed insufficient, further no details as regards the account holder were evident on the documentation submitted;2. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application in that there was no birth certificates for the applicants submitted.  There was no documentation submitted verifying that the father has been granted full custody of the applicants.  Further there was no written consent from the mother or a copy of her passport for verification of signature.The applicants lodged appeals which were received in the Visa Office, Dublin on the 17 August 2009.  Both decisions of the Visa Officer were upheld by the Appeals Officer on 14 September 2009.  Only one appeal per application is allowed.  The only option now available to the applicants is to make a fresh visa application.

There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004 define a Stateless person as being ‘within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of the 28th day of September, 1954'. The definition of a ‘Stateless Person' as outlined under this Convention is ‘a person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of it’s law’. Every application for a certificate of naturalisation is dealt with on an individual basis, if the applicant claims to be stateless then the citizenship laws of the country of origin, country of birth and any other country that may be involved are examined to determine whether the applicant is entitled to citizenship. It is only after these checks are completed will a determination on the nationality of the applicant be made. This assessment does not take place in cases where the application is ineligible or refused.The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, applies to all applicants for a certificate of naturalisation and provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the applicant must:be of full age;be of good character;have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation;have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include:periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State;periods granted for the purposes of study;periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.The number of applicants who presented as Stateless persons in the last 5 years is 23. Of these, 5 applications were approved, with 2 of the applicants determined to have a nationality other than Stateless, while 11 applications are pending a decision.

I am informed by Garda authorities that all Divisions within the Dublin Metropolitan Region were successfully migrated to the new system during July of this year.  The next phase of rollout in the Eastern Region is now under way and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  I am further advised that a total of 5,904 Gardaí have access to the new digital radio service at this stage of the rollout.  Nationwide rollout of the radio system is on schedule for completion by the second Quarter of 2011.  In the meantime Garda authorities will continue to maintain the existing radio infrastructure as required in areas not yet covered by the new system.

Among the key provisions included in this Act are:1. That all organised crime offences are scheduled offences for the purpose of the Offences Against the State Act so that they will be tried in the Special Criminal Court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions directs otherwise;2. The creation of a new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment;3. The maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime has been increased from 5 years to 15 years imprisonment;4. With regard to all organised crime offences the Court will be enabled to draw inferences from failure to answer questions, failure to account for movements, actions, activities or associations;5. The penalty for intimidation of a witness or juror has been increased from 10 years to 15 years' imprisonment.The Government is committed to ensuring that the criminal law is effectively implemented and that the administration of justice is not interfered with through the intimidation of juries and witnesses.  This new legislation provides the State with the measures to put these criminals in prison for long periods and help rid society of the scourge of organised crime gangs.The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 provides a legal framework to allow covert surveillance material to be used in criminal trials.  This Act provides a statutory framework for the operation of secret electronic surveillance to combat serious crime, as well as subversive and terrorist threats against the security of the State and builds in safeguards into its authorisation, duration and operation.  The provisions of the Act include the admissibility as evidence of information obtained as a result of surveillance in criminal proceedings.Multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where all of the National Units from National Support Services i.e. National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Criminal Assets Bureau, Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (Money Laundering) and the Garda Technical Bureau, are used to combat serious crime.  These Units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and timely information.This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a coordinated use of Garda resources using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.  The situation is being closely monitored and kept under constant review by senior Garda management in conjunction with Regional Assistant Commissioners and Heads of Units.

Resource levels are monitored on an ongoing basis by Garda Management in each District and Division, in conjunction with crime trends and other demands made on An Garda Síochána.

Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it an offence to harm or threaten or in any other way intimidate or put in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation by An Garda Síochána of an offence, or is a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence, or a member of his or her family, with the intention thereby of causing the investigation or the course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.I am informed by the Garda authorities that separate records are not maintained of offences under section 41 as between those directed against witnesses and those directed against jurors.  Accordingly, the information available from the Gardaí covers both categories of individuals. The Deputy will appreciate that, of their nature, instances of intimidation of jurors are less likely to come to notice than instances of witness intimidation.The following table shows the position with regard to the number of proceedings that have been commenced for offences under Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the period from 2007 to 10 September 2009.YearProceedings2009 (to 10 Sept.)*14200816200716*Figures for 2009 are provisional.The statutory provisions available to counteract jury intimidation reflect the gravity of the offence.  The Gardaí rigorously enforce these provisions and, of course, will continue to do so. Further legislative action has being taken, including a significant increase in the penalty following conviction for jury intimidation, in the context of the recent Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.

No decisions have been taken as yet as about their accommodation.  It is also unclear how much support they will need in order to be resettled and to integrate successfully into life in this country.  In these circumstances, it is not possible to give the projected annual cost sought by the Deputy. While there may be additional security costs, these are difficult to quantify at this juncture and, in any event, I do not believe that they will be in the order of magnitude as speculated when in the media recently.

As a result, more limited funding was offered to the 38 community groups which had previously been recommended for funding under the "Access to Employment" strand of the Measure.  To date, 35 of those groups have accepted this offer and are expected to receive a total of over €1 million in 2009 to enable them to work with  disadvantaged women.  This will enable the women clients to upskill with a view to their entering into formal training, education and employment.  Discussions are ongoing with a further two groups while one group did not respond to the offer.

Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  The Department of Education and Science provide an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs (220 in the academic year 2009/10).  This allocation allows an extensive educational programme to be run in each institution and participation in education runs at around 50% of the prisoner population.Literacy work has been a strong element of the prison education curriculum since the early 1980s.  The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and respects the adult status of the student and his/her prior knowledge, skills and life experience.  It is also concerned with improving self-esteem and building confidence.The Irish Prison Service publication entitled "The Prison Adult Literacy Survey — Results and Implications" published in September 2003 is the most recent information available to my Department.  The major results of the survey showed that a significant number of prisoners have virtually no literacy skills — 52% of them were at Level 1 or Pre-Level 1 literacy levels.  More than twice as many prisoners are at the lowest level compared with the general population.  An Adult Basic Education Development Worker has specific responsibility in the Prison Service for implementing and supporting initiatives in the area of literacy, numeracy and basic education.A literacy action plan is prepared by the prison education centre of each prison.   Literacy classes form an important part of the curriculum.  Every effort is made to publicise the classes and encourage as many prisoners as possible to avail of them.  Literacy work forms an element of more than just the timetabled literacy classes.  All teachers are aware of literacy needs and these are accommodated by use of a themed literacy approach across the whole curriculum as well as vocational work and training activities.  This is a very effective method of linking literacy to areas prisoners can engage with and is widely used in adult education.The Irish Prison Service is implementing the new assessment framework devised by the National Adult Literacy Agency, "Mapping the Learning Journey".  This assessment framework identifies learner progress, provides tangible feedback and indicates areas on which to focus.  It is a useful tool for both learning and teaching.

Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.  The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that over time the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts, as there are inevitably time lapses between the commencement of a criminal investigation, proceedings being commenced and convictions secured.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder.

It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.Legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is extremely robust and heavy penalties are in place.  The Garda Commissioner last year made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda Síochána have been given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords have been banned from importation and sale, though exceptions have been made for collectors and martial artists.  Last February, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda Síochána to inform and educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime.RecordedProceeding commencedConvictions1058644

An exception is made for probationer Gardaí, who are required to attend court to deal with their own first ten cases in order to obtain court experience.Gardaí are of course required to attend court when requested, but where possible every case is dealt with by the court presenter up to the final hearing.  In the event of the defendant pleading guilty the court presenter can deal with this case by giving a précis of evidence to the Court and apprising the Court of any previous convictions.  If the defendant pleads not guilty then the member in charge of the case will appear in Court on the assigned date for hearing to prosecute the case.Outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Region all criminal cases, whether by summons or charge sheet, are currently presented in the District Court by the local Superintendent or an Inspector acting on his or her behalf.

Where a Garda station is not equipped with an audio/video system, a person to be interviewed in accordance with the Regulations will be taken to the nearest Garda station with such equipment.In this regard it should be noted that it was never the intention that all Garda stations would be equipped to carry out audio/video recording of interviews. Rather the intention was that a sufficient number of interview rooms in Garda stations across the country be equipped to provide a broad nationwide coverage.  In this context, the Garda authorities have advised me that a Garda survey indicates that at 31st May 2009 some 99.1% of interviews as specified in the Regulations were being recorded. Interviews are not recorded for a number of reasons including the arrested person declining to have the interview recorded or the equipment already being in use or otherwise unavailable.

The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the Court.  Of the total number of deaths in custody since 2005, the cause of death has been determined formally in twenty eight cases. Nine deaths were attributed to natural causes, nine were classified as deaths by misadventure, three were classified as open verdicts, three were classified as suicide, two were classified as accidental and a narrative verdict was recorded in two cases.There are strategies and plans in place in all institutions for the prevention of suicides. The circumstances of each death in prison custody are also examined by a multi-disciplinary group in each institution.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service Steering Group for the Prevention of Self-Harm and Death in the Prison Population provides a forum for collating the reports of the local groups and disseminating significant findings throughout the prison system.Deaths in Garda Custody refer to a death which takes place after a person comes into the custody and control of a Garda and before leaving the custody and control of a Garda. Thus it includes, for example, a death at any time from the time of arrest, including the handing of a person into the care of a hospital for treatment, or prison while under the control of a Garda.Prior to the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, investigations into deaths occurring in Garda custody were carried out by a Superintendent from outside the Garda Division, appointed by the Divisional Officer. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission commenced operations on 9 May 2007.  Section 102(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 states that the Garda Commissioner shall refer to the Ombudsman Commission any matter that appears to the Garda Commissioner to indicate that the conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person.The following table shows the number of deaths of person in Garda custody recorded by An Garda Síochána for 2005-2009 (10th September 2009):YearDeaths In Garda CustodyGarda Station/Location20091Navan Garda Station20080Nil20076(1) Store Street Garda Station(2) Tralee Garda Station(3) Togher Garda Station(4) Naas Garda Station(5) Terenure Garda Station.(6) 8 MacSweeny Villas, Gurranabraher, Cork — the person died as a Search Warrant was being executed at this address20062Waterford Garda StationCoolock Garda Station20052Monaghan Garda StationStore Street Garda Station

Tipperary and in Tallaght, Dublin 24 which are funded by my Department, through the Probation Service and which operate on the principles of restorative justice (RJ) with the twin aim of attempting to heal the harm done to victims and at the same time holding the offender accountable for his or her actions.In the case of juveniles, restorative justice was introduced on a statutory basis for the first time in the Children Act 2001. There are two restorative justice initiatives provided for in the Act: A restorative conference or restorative caution included in the Garda Diversion Programme and a court-ordered restorative justice family conference delivered through the Probation Service.The Garda Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending. The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, it pays the highest regard to the needs of the victims. The programme has proven to be successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families. This programme operates nationwide.Family conferencing administered by the Probation Service at the request of the Courts under Sections 78-87 of the Children Act, 2001 is another restorative practice and is available on a national basis. A family conference is based on the principles of restorative justice. The aim of the family conference is to divert the young person, who has accepted responsibility for his or her behaviour, from Court, from conviction and custody and from committing further offences.As the Deputy will be aware a National Commission on Restorative Justice chaired by Judge Mary Martin was asked to look at this whole area. I am glad to tell the Deputy that I recently received the final report of this Group. The report and its recommendations are currently being examined by my Department having regard to resource and funding implications and against the background of the range of other non-custodial measures available to the courts.   I will be bringing my proposals to Government in due course.

On foot of its recommendations a wide-ranging and comprehensive recruitment campaign for the FSL was undertaken in 2008 and resulted in 12 new Forensic Scientists and 14 new Laboratory Analysts being recruited. In addition an Assistant Principal IT Manager was assigned to the FSL in December 2008. This represents a step-change in the capacity of the Laboratory.

Agreement has been reached with the Department of Defence to acquire about 160 acres at Kilworth, County Cork for a new prison development. Government approval for the transfer of the land has also been obtained.The Prison Service commissioned a preliminary site suitability report. This involved a range of surveys such as archaeology, flora and fauna, road/infrastructure, topography etc.  This preliminary site suitability report has confirmed that there are no significant constraints to the development of this site.  While the project has not advanced to detailed design stage, the Irish Prison Service estimate that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450 spaces, 400 male and 50 female. These figures will be reviewed as the project progresses to detailed design stage and in light of prisoner population surveys.In accordance with Department of Finance Capital Appraisal Guidelines a preliminary outline case has been completed and approved by the Prisons Authority Interim Board.  The next step in the appraisal process is the preparation of a detailed business case for the project which will examine the various procurement options including the Public Private Partnership option.  The advice of the NDFA will be sought in relation to these issues in due course.

That remains the position.  While I have taken no final decision on a commencement date, I would note that the section will not be commenced before 1 December at the earliest as that is the date which has been chosen for other sections in the Act.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1022	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 767 to 770, inclusive, together.One of the options open to persons faced with the prospect of having a Deportation Order issued in respect of them is that they can seek to return voluntarily to their country of origin.  Asylum seekers and irregular migrants from non-EU countries who agree to return voluntarily to their countries of origin but do not have the financial means or in some instances the necessary documentation to do so, can obtain assistance through the Voluntary Assisted Return and Re-integration Programme (VARRP).  This Programme is funded by my Department and managed by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).In 2008, a total of 566 applications were received under the VARRP, representing 809 individuals.  Between 1st January and 31st August, 2009 a total of 391 applications were received, representing 624 individuals.  In 2008, 436 people were assisted through the VARRP to return to their home countries, while in the period January-August 2009 a total of 295 have returned under the Programme.The full cost of the VARRP in 2008 was €1,239,065 of which €483,063 was expended on operational costs with the balance being attributed, in the main, to staff and office costs.  It is anticipated that a similar breakdown between operational costs and staff and office costs will be the outcome of the 2009 programme when the full year figures become available.  People returning under the VARRP are provided with assistance by IOM staff during their departure through the airport, and in their country of return by locally based staff, if required.  However, IOM staff do not accompany those returning except in very exceptional circumstances, e.g. unaccompanied minors or medical cases.  Cases of this nature would generally arise on no more than two or three occasions in any one year.The countries to which people voluntarily returned under the VARRP in 2008 were: Albania, Algeria, Botswana, Brazil, China, Croatia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Ghana, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Kenya, Kosovo, Libya, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritius, Moldova, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Syria, Uganda, Ukraine.To date in 2009 the countries of return under the Programme include:- Brazil, Moldova, Georgia, Nigeria, Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Iraq, South Africa, China, Congo, Croatia, Benin, Malaysia, Columbia, Mongolia, Argentina, Armenia, Afghanistan, Australia, Bolivia, Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mauritius, New Zealand, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, United Emirates, Pakistan, Philippines.

I can also inform the Deputy that in October 2008 my Department ran two awareness raising campaigns concerning (a) Fireworks, at a total cost of €150,320 and (b) Anti-Human Trafficking, at a cost of €129,566, exclusive of VAT. In addition to these campaigns my Department made funding of €45,980 available to Ruhama in 2008 in order to develop a television advertising campaign to promote awareness of Human Trafficking. Awareness raising initiatives such as this were recommended in the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016.In the time available it has not been possible for An Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to compile the information requested by the Deputy. When this information comes to hand I will forward it to him.

All applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application has been finalised and the file will be submitted to me for a decision shortly.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks and the time taken waiting for resources to become available to perform those checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The personnel strength of that District, as of the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 249.  The area is subject of regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the local Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units, the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented by the Divisional Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel. Two (2) members of the Community Policing Unit are allocated specifically to the area referred to. Complaints received by An Garda Síochána relating to public disorder and other anti-social type behaviours, are subject of investigation and offenders are dealt with by way of behaviour warnings (adult or child), public order fixed charge notices, civil orders and criminal prosecutions.Current policing policy in the Coolock area is predicated on the prevention of public order offences, the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents of the area.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	Ireland does not possess — and never has possessed — any weapons, armaments or ammunition containing depleted uranium. Ireland shares concerns which have been raised at the UN General Assembly about the potential risks related to the use of depleted uranium in armaments and munitions. We voted in favour of UN resolutions on depleted uranium in 2007 and in 2008.In 2008, Resolution 63/26 called on the Secretary-General of the UN to request “relevant international organizations to update and complete, as appropriate, their studies and research on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment.”
The resolution also called on Member States to “facilitate such studies and research, and to communicate to the Secretary- General their views on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium.”
In follow-up to that resolution, Ireland recently submitted a report to the UN Secretary-General setting out our views. The report mentioned our concerns about the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments and ammunition containing depleted uranium and the impact they could have on human health and the environment.Ireland will continue to monitor this issue closely, especially in relation to the studies and research by relevant international organisations and any developments in the analysis of risks associated with the use of depleted uranium. The work of civil society in this area is also important. We maintain contact with NGOs such as the International Campaign to Ban Uranium Weapons (ICBUW). Officials from my Department met a delegation from ICBUW in Dublin in June 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	On Friday, 2 October, the Irish people will be asked to endorse a package on the Lisbon Treaty that is fundamentally different from that of June 2008. One key change in the new package is the indefinite retention of Ireland's EU Commissioner. A series of binding legal guarantees ensures further protection in other areas of national sensitivity.During last year's referendum, the retention of an Irish Commissioner was a central issue. The Conclusions of last June's European Council provide that, if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, the European Council will take a decision to ensure that the Commission will continue to include one national of each Member State. This requires that the Lisbon Treaty be ratified, as the existing Treaties will necessitate a reduced Commission from November 2009 onwards. Any future change to this decision would require a unanimous decision, which means that this could be blocked by Ireland or any other Member State.  The other element of the new package is the set of binding legal guarantees on the right to life, education and the family, taxation and Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.The legal guarantees make explicit that "[t]he Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality." The Treaty envisages that Member States will provide aid and assistance to another EU Member State which is the victim of armed aggression. However, it states that the obligation of aid and assistance shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of each Member State. Our legal guarantee further states that "it will be for Member States—including Ireland, acting in a spirit of solidarity and without prejudice to its traditional policy of military neutrality—to determine the nature of aid or assistance to be provided to a Member State which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of armed aggression on its territory".There is no obligation, therefore, to provide military support.  Any action taken by Ireland must respect the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the relevant legislation, including provisions of the Defence Acts relating to UN authorisation and Dáil approval. These will be unchanged by the Lisbon Treaty.  The guarantee on security and defence is reinforced by the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009, which would carry forward the existing constitutional ban on participation in a common European defence.In relation to the Deputy's query about Permanent Structured Cooperation, I would note that Permanent Structured Cooperation only permits a group of Member States to develop higher-end military capabilities for ESDP missions and more extensive co-operation in such areas as training, equipment, and logistics. It has the potential to provide significant benefits in the form of enhanced capabilities for UN-mandated, EU crisis management missions as well as for peacekeeping missions under direct UN command. Permanent Structured Cooperation would be established by qualified majority vote.The following point is critical, however: under the Lisbon Treaty no mission, including one utilising Permanent Structured Cooperation, may be launched without the unanimous approval of the Council. Ireland will always have a veto over any operation which might be launched by the Union.Ireland is not obliged to participate in Permanent Structured Cooperation. This is confirmed in our legal guarantee, which states "[i]t is also a matter for each Member State to decide, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and any domestic legal requirements, whether to participate in permanent structured cooperation".The provisions of the Treaty, reinforced by the legal guarantees, make clear that our traditional policy of military neutrality would not be prejudiced by the entry into force of the Treaty. At the same time, the Treaty would ensure that the Defence Forces continue to occupy the position they have occupied for more than 50 years, at the forefront of peace support missions on behalf of the UN around the globe.The legally binding nature of the guarantees obtained by Ireland at the European Council last June is beyond question. The guarantees, which take the form of a Decision of the Heads of State or Government, meeting within the European Council, constitute an international agreement, binding in international law. This was stated explicitly by the Heads of State or Government when they reached agreement in June 2009. The international agreement will take effect on the date of entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, should next month's referendum be passed.At the time of the conclusion of the next accession Treaty, the legal guarantees will be set out in a Protocol to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. As a Protocol, the legal guarantees will enjoy the same status in EU law as the Treaties. They will form part of the fundamental law of the Union.  I am satisfied that the new package we have obtained from the other Member States of the EU will give many who voted No last year the reassurance they require on sensitive issues to do with the right to life, education and the family; taxation; and defence and security.  The legal guarantees on security and defence is given below, for the sake of completeness.Security and DefenceThe Union's action on the international scene is guided by the principles of democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.The Union's common security and defence policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy and provides the Union with an operational capacity to undertake missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.It does not prejudice the security and defence policy of each Member State, including Ireland, or the obligations of any Member State.The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.It will be for Member States — including Ireland, acting in a spirit of solidarity and without prejudice to its traditional policy of military neutrality — to determine the nature of aid or assistance to be provided to a Member State which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of armed aggression on its territory.Any decision to move to a common defence will require a unanimous decision of the European Council. It would be a matter for the Member States, including Ireland, to decide, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and with their respective constitutional requirements, whether or not to adopt a common defence.Nothing in this Section affects or prejudices the position or policy of any other Member State on security and defence.It is also a matter for each Member State to decide, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and any domestic legal requirements, whether to participate in permanent structured cooperation or the European Defence Agency.The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.It does not affect the right of Ireland or any other Member State to determine the nature and volume of its defence and security expenditure and the nature of its defence capabilities.It will be a matter for Ireland or any other Member State, to decide, in accordance with any domestic legal requirements, whether or not to participate in any military operation.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 779, 780 and 782 together.Ireland spent €920 million on Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2008. This represents approximately 0.59% of our Gross National Product (GNP) and makes Ireland one of the most generous donors in the world on a per capita basis. This is an enormous achievement of which we should all be justifiably proud. For 2009 the total budget for ODA is expected to reach €696 million which, on current projections, will represent at least 0.48% of Ireland's GNP.The Government very much regrets it has been necessary to reduce the ODA budget for 2009. As with all budget cuts across Government Departments, our sole objective is to ensure the stabilisation of the Public Finances. This is a requirement for the resumption of economic growth, which is the only sustainable way Ireland can meet its future ODA commitments.The ODA budget for this year of €696 million will likely leave Ireland as the sixth largest aid donor internationally, in per capita terms. It will now be more difficult to achieve the Government's target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012. However, the Government continues to work towards the target and will make a full assessment of our capacity to achieve it in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget. It is important to note that Ireland is still significantly ahead of all but a few EU Member States in making progress towards achieving the broad EU 0.7% target in 2015.The decisions which have been taken to adjust the programme have been framed in the context of Ireland's firm commitment to the world's poorest and our determination that, once the Irish economy has returned to a pattern of sustainable growth, we will resume the expansion of our aid programme.  Ireland's programme of development assistance is renowned internationally for its quality and clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger, and on the least developed countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The Government is determined, now more than ever, that the programme will maintain this focus and will continue to make a positive and lasting difference to millions of poor people, especially in Africa.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	Ireland attaches importance to the work of trade unionists in Colombia, and condemns all acts or threats of violence against trade union organisations and individuals there.  We raised the issue of human rights in Colombia during the Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review on Colombia in December 2008.  Specifically, we recommended that the Colombian Government implement its existing legislation in full, sanction unsubstantiated allegations against individual activists, strengthen the protection provided to individuals and investigate and punish crimes against them.Ireland, along with its EU partners, monitors the human rights situation in Colombia and raises issues including human rights abuses impacting on trade unionists with the Colombian authorities through the ongoing EU-Colombia dialogue on human rights and in regular contacts at political level.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	My Department first became aware of the arrest of the person mentioned by the Deputy by the Cambodian authorities, in June 2009.  As we have no resident Embassy in Cambodia, our Embassy in Vietnam, which is also accredited to Cambodia, sought assistance from the British Embassy, to visit the person concerned and to provide all possible consular assistance on our behalf.  My Department has since been involved in efforts to assist the person concerned and I will communicate directly with the Deputy on the matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	Intensive US-led efforts have been continuing in recent months to put in place the conditions that would allow for the resumption of direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.  The US envoy to the Middle East, Senator George Mitchell, has been working closely with both parties in order to generate a sense of momentum and to restore Israeli and Palestinian confidence in the merits of peaceful engagement.  This has been a delicate and difficult process and has involved significant diplomatic work on the ground in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  EU Foreign Ministers, at their recent informal meeting in Stockholm which I attended, made clear the EU's full support for these efforts.  There is still some hope that the recent diplomatic efforts will culminate in a tripartite meeting between President Obama, President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly later this month which might re-launch the peace process and direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations which have been suspended since last December.The primary obstacle to the resumption of negotiations so far has been continued illegal Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.  Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has made it clear that he is not prepared to meet with his Israeli counterparts until there has been a genuine and complete freeze on settlement building.  Senator Mitchell has expended considerable effort on trying to strike a deal with the Israeli Government on such a settlement freeze.  Promisingly, there have been indications in recent weeks that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu may be prepared to agree to a freeze in some form so that peace talks could resume.The current efforts to re-launch peace negotiations have, however, been undermined to some extent by the decision of the Israeli Defence Ministry last week to give approval for the construction of 450 new homes in the occupied West Bank.  This decision is difficult to reconcile with the current US-led efforts and threatens to erode the goodwill that has been carefully cultivated in recent weeks.  It also undermines the position of moderate Palestinian leaders seeking to justify peaceful engagement with Israel.Both the EU, in a Declaration issued on 8 September, and the US have clearly expressed their disappointment over this particular settlement expansion plan. UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has also made his displeasure about the move known.  Ireland's position is very clear.  Israeli settlement building, whether in East Jerusalem or in the West Bank, is illegal under international law and represents a primary obstacle to the two-State solution.  Continued expansion of these settlements undermines the viability of a Palestinian State and makes the realisation of that goal harder to achieve.Moreover, the daily and cumulative injustices and humiliations which the whole settlement process entails for the Palestinian population serve to increase the risk of another large scale descent into violence.  Within the context of the EU, Ireland has long been among the most active Member States in ensuring that these concerns about settlement expansion are made known to the Israeli Government at every opportunity.  I have also personally raised my deep concerns about the issue directly with Israeli leaders and officials.Prime Minister Netanyahu, in a significant move for a leader of the Likud Party, indicated earlier this year his conditional acceptance of the objective of a two-State solution.  The international community is now awaiting evidence of deeds to match those words.  Settlement expansion cannot be reconciled with the goal of a viable two-State solution.  I would now call on Prime Minister Netanyahu and his Government to provide further clear evidence of their determination to take the difficult decisions that are needed for peace.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	The situation in Zimbabwe continues to be of great concern to the Government and to the European Union as a whole.  The formation of a unity government in Zimbabwe in February though it fell well short of the solution required for Zimbabwe's problems, was nonetheless a sign of some modest political progress.  However, seven months on, and despite some improvements in the economic sphere, the situation in Zimbabwe remains very fragile.  I am gravely concerned by reports of continuing human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, torture of prisoners and abuse of the rule of law.  The lack of real progress on many issues vital to Zimbabwe's recovery and the failure to reform media laws to allow for meaningful press freedom are causes of ongoing concern.A particular concern is the continued failure of President Mugabe to address the issue of senior government appointments in a manner consistent with the September 2008 power-sharing agreement.  The retention of Gideon Gono as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and Johannes Tomana as Attorney General is detrimental to the interests of the country; their removal is vital to the building of confidence among international donors and investors.Ireland has worked closely with our EU partners in developing a consistent approach to Zimbabwe.  In keeping with other international donors, we do not provide funding to the Zimbabwean Government, but respond to the humanitarian needs of the Zimbabwean people through support for the work of multilateral and non-governmental organisations.  Thus far in 2009, Ireland has committed funding of over €5 million to a range of humanitarian programmes in Zimbabwe, focussed on food security, tackling HIV and AIDS and supporting civil society organisations who provide essential services for the population.The EU has repeatedly stated its willingness to re-engage with the Zimbabwean Government.  Re-engagement, however, remains conditional on the agreed goals set out in the power-sharing agreement being met.  These include full access to humanitarian assistance, restoration of the rule of law, commitment to the democratic process, respect for human rights and commitment to macroeconomic stabilisation.Following the visit to Brussels last June by Zimbabwe's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, a high-level European delegation travelled to Zimbabwe last weekend, the first such visit in seven years.  The EU delegation said relations with the country were entering a "new phase" but full cooperation hinged on the implementation of a power-sharing deal.  The delegation noted that the Global Political Agreement (GPA) was an important step forward, but that much still needs to be done.  The delegation also said that the EU will not consider lifting targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe until sufficient progress is made on the implementation of the GPA, in particular until human rights abuses are ended.Zimbabwe's neighbours have a critical role to play in encouraging reform, and can bring the greatest influence to bear in achieving progress in implementing the power sharing agreement.  It is disappointing therefore that the discussions on the implementation of the GPA that were scheduled to take place at the recent Summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Kinshasa, which President Mugabe attended, were deferred.Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor the situation, and maintain contacts with key African partners, including the African Union and the Southern African Development Community.  It is vital for the future of Zimbabwe that the unity government delivers on the promise of reform, and secures for Zimbabwe's people real political freedoms, a return to the rule of law and economic development.  Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the international community to encourage progress in these areas.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1036	I can assure the Deputy that the Irish Government has been making every possible effort to secure the release of Ms Sharon Commins and her fellow Goal development worker, Ms Hilda Kawuki, since their original abduction on Friday 3 July.  I visited Sudan on the 6th and 7th of September to discuss with the Sudanese authorities the efforts that are being made to ensure safe return of Sharon and that of her colleague to their families.During my recent visit I met with the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, who is coordinating the Sudanese efforts, the UN Deputy Special Representative, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Presidential advisor on Darfur.  The discussions were useful and I impressed on them the importance of bringing about a peaceful and successful resolution of this appalling kidnapping, which targeted development workers whose only objective was to assist the ordinary people of Darfur, who have suffered so much in the conflict there.  I was briefed on the ongoing efforts to release the hostages.  I believe that every effort is being made at the moment to obtain the release of both women.  I also met with the Goal representatives on the ground and with the Ambassador of Uganda.As the Deputy will appreciate there is a need for discretion during a kidnap episode.  I cannot go into detail about the operation in Sudan but I can assure him that I will continue to keep in close touch with our team on the ground and with the Sudanese authorities until we secure the release of the two women.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1037	There are no state agencies operating under the responsibility of my Department.  However, there are two Advisory Committees and one Educational Commission, which operate under the aegis of my Department.  There are no civil servants serving on these bodies who are in receipt of any specific remuneration for their representation.The Development Education Advisory Committee was established in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Minister, Minister of State and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education.  All members serve in a voluntary capacity and there are no civil servants serving on this Committee.The Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (previously known as Díon) was set up in 1984 to advise the Government on the welfare of the Irish community in Britain.  The Committee's primary role is to advise on the distribution of Government support to voluntary agencies providing front line services and community care to Irish people in Britain.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	The question of the demarcation of borders of the Ilemi Triangle between Kenya, Sudan and Ethiopia has been ongoing for over one hundred years.  The problem has its origin in the ambiguity in the wording of colonial-era treaties.  The treaties sought to allow for free movements of Turkana nomadic herders within the region.  Despite several attempts over the years to negotiate a resolution, there has been no universal agreement on demarcation of the borders.The dispute has been prolonged because jurisdiction is all the more difficult to resolve where nomadic and pastoral lifestyles dominate.  The general instability in the Horn of Africa region as a whole has tended to obscure this issue; the loss of life and large-scale displacement of millions of people in more high profile conflicts in the region have deflected attention from it.  Currently Kenya has de facto control over part of the region but much of it is not administered by any state.  There are at present no initiatives from any of the countries directly involved or from any international organisation to negotiate a resolution in relation to the dispute.  In all the circumstances it would not be appropriate for Ireland to raise the matter at this time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1039	I am aware of the case of Dr. Tajbakhsh who was arrested at his home on 9 July in Iran and whose conditions of detention remain unclear.  Our Embassy in Tehran has been closely following his case.  As the Deputy will be aware, many hundreds remain in detention in Iran following the disputed Presidential elections of 12 June and it is still not clear when, and by what process, these will be released.  There appears to be some degree of disarray in the judicial system, with trial dates being set and then re-scheduled and diverging views internally within the regime as to how the protestors should be dealt with.There are some positive signals that there may be a release of prisoners during the forthcoming Eid el Fitr holiday, which marks the end of Ramadan.  However, if there is such a release, it seems unlikely that many key political associates of opposition leaders or high profile detainees will be included.  I am aware that Dr. Tajbakhsh, who is a US dual citizen and a noted and respected academic, has been accused of being a spy for a western intelligence agency, has been arrested before on similar charges, and has already had to participate in one of the televised "show trials".  The prospects for securing his early release may not be assisted by the prevailing tendency on the part of the authorities in Iran to assert incorrectly that the post-election protests represented an attempted revolution, orchestrated by international actors.Diplomatic efforts, spear-headed by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran which handles US interests, are continuing in an effort to secure Dr. Tajbakhsh's release.  The EU has also been vocal in its reaction to the deterioration in human rights generally in Iran since the disputed Presidential elections, with a particular focus on the maltreatment of those in detention and the need for due legal process to prevail.Ireland strongly associates itself with the serious concerns expressed by the EU regarding the current human rights situation in Iran in the aftermath of the June presidential elections.  Senior officials of my Department have met with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland on several occasions throughout the summer, to convey my strong concerns on these matters to him.  We will continue to bring these matters and the case of detainees such as Dr. Tajbakhsh to the attention of the Iranian authorities and will also avail of the opportunity to express our concerns, both nationally and in an EU context, at the Human Rights Council in Geneva later this month.

Deepening public understanding of the EU and maximising public awareness of Ireland's role in the Union is an ongoing strategic priority for my Department.The deadline for submission of tenders was 11 May 2009.  Fourteen tenders were received and detailed consideration was given to these tenders in accordance with the normal public procurement rules and with a view to ensuring value for money.  It was decided on 22 May to award the contract to Language Communications Ltd.  The contract value was €564,922.00, inclusive of VAT. The bulk of that amount was allocated to cover the cost of advertising in a range of local and national media.  The contract was signed on 19 June 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1043	The issue on which the Deputy seeks clarification relates to the wording of the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009, which was passed by both House of the Oireachtas on 9 July.  The Bill is necessary to enable the State to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon.The Government and opposition parties have taken great care to ensure that the proposition put to the people on Friday, 2 October, is as clear and as comprehensible as possible.  The explanatory memorandum which was prepared to accompany the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009's passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas explains in detail the reasoning underlying the language of the amendment.The new subsection 6°, which is referred to in the material supplied by the Deputy, is modelled on the current Article 29.4.10°.  This provision has essentially been in place since Ireland's accession to the European Communities in 1973, and does not represent a legal innovation of any kind.  It ensures legal compatibility between EU law and the Irish Constitution, and would carry forward constitutional cover for laws, acts and measures "necessitated by the obligations" of EU membership, before and after the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force.  I should add that this applies only to those policy areas where the EU has been given powers by the Member States.  The Lisbon Treaty makes it clear that competences not specifically conferred on the EU remain with the Member States.In advance of the referendum, each voter in Ireland will receive a Statement for the Information of Voters, approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Statement will give the wording of the proposed amendment, along with an explanation of what it entails.  The wording of the amendment, together with the accompanying explanation, will also be available in polling stations on the day of the referendum.In addition to the explanatory material on the legislation, the Government has prepared a comprehensive information package, covering the Treaty of Lisbon, the new package, and, separately, issues related to the broader issue of Ireland's membership of the European Union.  The Government's Lisbon Treaty website, www.lisbontreaty.ie , is a reliable source of current, factual information on the Treaty.Similarly, the Referendum Commission's website, Similarly, the Referendum Commission's website, www.lisbontreaty2009.ie will be of value to voters seeking to inform themselves about the Treaty and the additional legal guarantees obtained by Ireland in June, in the run-up to the referendum.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1044	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 794 to 796, inclusive, together.The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) was ratified by Ireland on 8 December 1989.  The Optional Protocol to this International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) will set up a mechanism that will make it possible for individuals or groups of individuals to submit a complaint to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in regard to violations of their economic, social and cultural rights by a State Party to that Protocol.  It does not create any new substantive rights.Discussions on the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR took place in a Working Group which held its first session in 2004.  In June 2006, the UN Human Rights Council mandated the Working Group to negotiate the text of an Optional Protocol, and requested the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group to prepare a draft to serve as the basis for negotiations.Following consideration by the UN Human Rights Council, the text of the Optional Protocol was presented to the UN General Assembly last year which adopted the text by consensus on 10 December 2008, the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Officials of this Department were actively engaged at all stages of negotiation on the Optional Protocol, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments, our EU partners and other UN member states.Inter-departmental consultations on consideration of Ireland's signature and ratification of the Optional Protocol are continuing, with this Department playing a co-ordination role.  Accordingly we do not expect to be in a position to sign the Optional Protocol at the signing ceremony in New York on 24 September 2009.

Thus far, fourteen officers in my Department have applied to participate in the Scheme.  There are no costs to my Department associated with the administration of the Cycle to Work Scheme.  The cost of any equipment purchased by the Department for its employees is met in full by means of deductions at source, made over the course of one year, from the salaries of the individual officers who are availing of the scheme.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1046	As Deputies will be aware, and as stated previously in this House on many occasions, the Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Burma and plays an active role in international efforts to bring about positive change there.  As indicated in the statement I issued on 11 August, the arrest, trial and conviction of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, on the most spurious of charges, further compounds the already bleak situation in that country, where repression against members of the opposition, the ethnic groups and the population at large continues unabated and human rights and fundamental freedoms are systematically denied.The sentence provides clear evidence of the regime's intent to silence Aung San Suu Kyi in the lead-up to the elections they plan to hold next year on the basis of a discredited new Constitution, which excludes her from running in them. It also serves to confirm the Burmese junta's determination to continue its illegal rule without regard for the will of the Burmese people, in blatant disregard of the demands of the international community, including the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon and in breach of international law and its own laws.More than 2,100 political prisoners are serving sentences in deplorable conditions, many on questionable charges. The elections which the Burmese authorities are planning to hold next year will have no credibility or legitimacy if they are not opened up fully to the opposition and to all ethnic groups.  Efforts by the international community, including those by the UN Secretary-General himself during his visit to Burma in July, and by his Good Offices Mission, to secure the release of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and the launching of a process of national dialogue and reconciliation have, unfortunately, been rejected by the regime to date.In the circumstances, Ireland has long been in favour of strong international action against the Burmese regime, including sanctions and an arms embargo. Together with EU partners, Ireland had been proposing a strengthening of EU sanctions in response to the action taken by the regime against Aung San Suu Kyi and I am pleased that, following the conviction, the EU has taken immediate action to extend its sanctions against the regime and the judges involved in her trial and sentencing. These additional restrictive measures came into force on 13 August.I will continue to work in the EU and UN frameworks and with the countries of the region to do all possible to advance our objectives in relation to Burma and to press for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners there. The up-coming twelfth session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva from 14 September to 2 October next will offer another such opportunity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	At the present moment, the results of the elections in Afghanistan are still awaited. Though the outcome is not entirely certain, I am happy to set out my views on the electoral process to date.I welcome the fact that it was possible to hold both Presidential and Provincial Elections in most parts of Afghanistan on 20 August, despite the very difficult security situation prevailing there and threats from the Taliban that they would be targeting polling stations and voters. I also welcome the fact that, despite the threats, around 17 million Afghans registered to vote in the months before the elections, that candidates in both elections were largely able to carry out successful election campaigning and that around 6,500 polling stations were set up and functioned on election day.However, the high number of Taliban attacks which took place in many parts of the country before and during the elections was a cause of great concern, with over 200 incidents in total recorded on election day. Although other factors were also involved, security threats were a major factor in a very low voter turn-out, estimated at under 30%. I am deeply concerned also by reports and evidence of large-scale fraud having taken place in the Presidential elections in particular, with over 2,000 complaints received by the ECC, about one third of those classified as ‘Category A' claims, which could, if substantiated, affect the outcome of the election.It is vital that the election process and outcome are seen to be credible. The low turn-out and the widespread allegations of fraud certainly raise questions about credibility, but it is too early at this stage to pronounce definitively on this issue. Ultimately, it will be up to the Afghan people to determine if the elections, and their outcome, are credible and acceptable in their eyes. How the ECC and the IEC handle the allegations of fraud — and are perceived to handle them — will be crucial in this regard. This process is currently underway, with some results annulled and some recounting and auditing taking place.The UN has been playing a major role in supporting the elections process. The EU has also assisted, most notably by agreeing to mount a full EU Electoral Observation Mission with around 200 professional monitors, who monitored both the preparations for the elections and the process on election day and who have also been providing independent assessments of the process to date. Two long-term Irish observers participated in the EU Mission. In addition, Irish Aid provided some funding through the UN system for the preparation of the elections.In a statement issued on 10 September by the EU Presidency, the EU expressed concern at the allegations of fraud at a number of polling stations, noting that the ECC has been required to investigate these claims. In the statement, the EU acclaimed the important work of the ECC to safeguard the credibility of the elections and underlined the need for its independence to be fully secured and given sufficient time to fulfil its mandate, in co-operation with the IEC. The EU statement also expressed the hope that all authorities will refrain from prejudging the result until it has been properly certified. I fully endorse this statement.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	I am dismayed by the decision of the Government of Sri Lanka to order the expulsion of Mr James Elder, the respected UNICEF Communication Chief in Sri Lanka, from the country, by 21 September.  The expulsion appears to relate to remarks made to the media by Mr Elder in the course of his official duties as UNICEF spokesperson, in relation to the suffering of children during the military campaign prior to the cessation of hostilities in May and also to conditions in the camps for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) which have been established by the Government since that time.I have noted that on 8 September the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has also strongly regretted the Government's decision and has indicated his intention to take up the issue with President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the earliest opportunity.  Mr Elder's expulsion follows the sentencing on 31 August of the journalist, J.S. Tissainayagam, to 20 years hard labour by the Colombo High Court on charges of violating anti-terrorism laws. Both the decision to expel Mr Elder and the verdict and disproportionate sentence handed down on Mr Tissainayagam give rise to serious concern in relation to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press in Sri Lanka.For my part, I have taken a consistently strong line, both bilaterally and within the EU, in pressing the Government of Sri Lanka to respond to international demands to fulfil its responsibilities to the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, including the 280,000 IDPs who are currently held in camps in the north of the country. In a discussion earlier this year at my instigation, I made clear to the Ambassador of Sri Lanka my deep concerns and expectations. My concerns were also conveyed last week by senior officials of my Department to a representative of the Government of Sri Lanka. These concerns relate to conditions within the IDP camps at the moment, to the need for independent monitoring of the situation and to the requirements of the Tamil community in the longer term, if a successful peace process is to be launched and sustained.At EU level, Ministers will discuss the situation in Sri Lanka at the GAERC meeting in October. We will discuss how best to engage the Government of Sri Lanka in a meaningful dialogue which will enable us to assist IDPs in the camps and which will also facilitate the genuinely inclusive process of political reconciliation with the Tamil minority which is urgently needed. This must be based on the principles of parity of esteem, consent, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights .In view of the serious humanitarian crisis in the affected areas, Irish Aid has provided funding of €308,000 for emergency response in Sri Lanka through NGO partners, including emergency medical and nutrition support, the provision of shelter, and distribution of food and non-food items. In addition, a member of Irish Aid's Rapid Response Corps was deployed to Sri Lanka to assist in the emergency response effort of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has overall responsibility for dormant accounts spending.  The funding through my Department is an element of a larger set of economic and social disadvantage funding measures including funding for persons with a disability.A network of 33 LSPs have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council (ISC) to coordinate and promote sport at local level especially amongst specific target groups such as older people, girls & women, people with disabilities, unemployed people, and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  The ISC has allocated €6 million to the LSPs in 2009.  The continuation of the SIDO scheme from 2010 will be dependent on negotiations on the 2010 Estimates.

I would like to assure the Deputy that in the ensuing debate I will be articulating the benefits to Ireland of having a vibrant film industry.As you are aware, the Section 481 film tax relief scheme was extended until the end of 2012 with significant enhancements in the two Finance Acts in 2008. Approval from the European Commission to the extension and the enhancements was obtained in March of this year and the Minister for Finance subsequently signed the commencement orders on 16 March. Clearly, this shows a long term commitment by the Government to the Irish audiovisual industry. Furthermore, the recently published Report of the Commission on Taxation recommended that the Section 481 scheme should be continued.  I want to reiterate that I remain fully committed to the Section 481 scheme, the Irish Film Board and the Irish audiovisual industry.

I understand that negotiations are still ongoing between the OPW, the Department of Finance and relevant authorities in relation to a particular site in Charlestown, which it has identified as being suitable.The Deputy will also be aware that the Department of Finance was recently approached by a community development organisation in relation to a property in Kiltimagh, Co Mayo, with turn-key potential as a headquarters building. On foot of this approach, OPW is currently examining the property in question to ascertain its suitability. I should emphasise that this is a sensible and prudent response to the approach that has been made and implies no decision.

I understand that work is continuing on the first phase of the Corridor, from Ennis to Athenry and it is on target to be completed by the end of the year.  The Government is committed to progressing planning on the Corridor and the immediate next step, following completion of phase 1, will be for Iarnród Éireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of phases 2 (Athenry-Tuam) and 3 (Tuam-Claremorris) with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake these works.The current funding environment is difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch.  However, the Minister for Transport is seeking to progress planning of projects, such as phases 2 and 3 of the WRC, to ensure that we are in a position to move speedily to construction when financial circumstances permit.  As part of the support for this project, my own Department has provided funding of €3.5m towards line clearance work.

This was done with a view to affording my Department the opportunity to review the Scheme's operation and to consult with interested parties.  This review is currently ongoing and to date in excess of 100 written submissions have been received. In addition, some 100 community groups have contributed to the review through a telephone survey conducted by my Department.My officials are also meeting with representatives of An Garda Síochána at national and local level, the Fire Services, officials of other Government Departments and the Health Service Executive and other parties dealing with issues surrounding the welfare and security of older people to establish what other measures might be implemented to improve the administration and operation of the Scheme.

The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.The supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €24 per week, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  When assessing entitlement to mortgage interest supplement, only the portion of mortgage interest that relates to the purchase, essential repair or improvement of a person's sole or main residence is taken into account.The Health Service Executive has advised that it refused payment of a mortgage interest supplement to the person concerned, on the grounds that his income is sufficient to meet the interest repayments on the element of his loan which relates to his main residence. His mortgage contains other elements not linked to the purchase, repair or improvement of his residence.  The Executive has further advised that a HSE Appeals Officer has upheld the decision of a Community Welfare Officer not to pay mortgage interest supplement to the person concerned. It is open to him to appeal this decision further to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

There are currently 107 Family Resource Centres (FRCs) nationwide. The total budget for the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme in 2009 is over €18m.The aim of this Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The emphasis in Family Resource Centres (FRC) is on the involvement of the local community in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned. FRCs assess the needs of their local communities and ensure that there are services and supports in place to address these needs. They involve people from marginalised groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels in the project.The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made a range of recommendations relating to the Department of Social and Family Affairs including recommendations relating to the Family Support Agency and its programmes. The Department will consider, as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010, the Report’s recommendations and decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for Government. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.

The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline [the National Framework of Qualifications {NFQ} and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching)] which add significantly to a person's employability.  Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included.  The number of people on the scheme at the end of the 2008/2009 academic year was 11,646 representing an increase of 31% on the previous academic year and the scheme was modified in the April supplementary budget to reduce the qualifying period.The focus of the back to education allowance is on providing assistance to the highest possible number of those in greatest need in terms of meeting the requirements of a modern labour market.  People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects.  The possession of qualifications such as Postgraduate Diplomas, Professional Diplomas and MA courses or specialised post-graduate courses in Science/IT/Engineering at level 9 or above on the NFQ are not regarded as a prerequisite to re-entering the workforce and at present there are no plans to extend the scheme to cover courses at this level.This approach is considered appropriate in the context of targeting scarce resources at the greatest need.  The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstance in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.

Reviews of means tested payments are also carried out by Inspectors to ensure the conditions regarding entitlement continue to be satisfied. The Inspectors' remit also includes the combating of fraud and abuse of all the Department's schemes.The increase in the Live Register over the last year or so has resulted in considerable extra demands being made on the resources of the Department's Inspectorate. As a result of this approval was received for 40 additional assignments to the grade of Social Welfare Inspector.  Of these 40 posts, 15 Inspectors have already been assigned and a further 12 posts are categorised as ‘offer accepted' where individuals have been appointed to the posts and the process of assigning them is underway. Work is continuing to fill the remaining 13 posts and it is hoped to have this process completed shortly.There are two Social Welfare Inspector posts in Tuam.  One of these posts has been vacant for some time although every effort has been made to fill this vacancy through staff re-deployment from other Government Departments.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to fill this position to date partly because it is in competition for resources with vacancies arising elsewhere in the East Galway area.  As an interim measure a full-time Inspector from Galway was assigned recently to the Tuam post on a temporary basis and in addition, some part-time support is also provided.

Branch Offices, which are operated by private individuals on behalf of the Department, are open from 9.30 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.  The Deputy will be aware that over the past year or so I have advised the House of a range of initiatives that have been introduced in local offices to help us deal with the influx of claims.  One of these initiatives involves dealing with customers by appointment and deciding claims were possible when the customer attends for their appointment.  This initiative has greatly reduced processing times for a significant number of customers and will be in operation in 20 local offices by the end of the month.  It is intended to extend this system to other offices over the coming months.Since May 2008, some 350 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new Central Support Units and the Departments Inspectorate.

Supports for families include child benefit, maternity/adoptive benefits, one-parent family payment and family income supplement.  Where appropriate, schemes provide for an increase in respect of the qualified adult or children of a claimant.The Department's employment support schemes, including the back to education allowance, are specifically designed to support people from welfare to work and for that reason are only available to welfare recipients or their qualified adults.  I am satisfied that this does not constitute discrimination against families or individuals who are not in receipt of social welfare.  It complies with the principles of horizontal equity which require that people in similar circumstances should be treated similarly.The objective of the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is primarily to equip people in receipt of certain social welfare payments with the qualifications and skills that will enable them to obtain employment and meet the requirements of the modern labour market.In order to qualify for the scheme it is necessary for a person to be in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified period.  The qualified adult of a person on a relevant social welfare payment can also participate in their own right on the scheme providing the conditions are fulfilled.  The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme and is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.The vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) is administered by the Department of Education and Science and operated through the VECs.  It is aimed at people on social welfare but the qualified adult of a person on a relevant social welfare payment can also participate in their own right scheme on this scheme.The Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Acts.  The review is examining the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department.  The findings of this review will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of all citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.

The qualifying criteria for entitlement to Blind Person's Pension are that a person must be over 18 years of age, satisfy a means test and be so blind that he or she cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue his or her ordinary occupation.The Blind Person's Pension was reviewed as part of the 2003 Review of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes, which concluded that these schemes are successful in meeting their objective of providing income support to people with disabilities.  As the objective of the Blind Persons Pension is a payment to provide income maintenance for persons of a working age is not considered appropriate to continue payment in addition to the State Pension (Contributory).

This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable.  Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in the demand for their services.  Generally, in assessing the means of a self-employed person, a Social Welfare Inspector will take into account the level of earnings in the preceding 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year.  However, with the general downturn in the economy at present, it is accepted that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year.  The Social Welfare Inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.  There are no immediate plans to review the criteria for Jobseekers Allowance.  Any such measure would have to be considered within a budgetary context.

Based on the information provided at the time of making her claim, she was awarded a pension at a reduced rate.Following the death of the pensioner, a Schedule of Assets was submitted to the department in line with legislative requirements.  On examination, it was found that certain accounts held in financial institutions had not been disclosed by the pensioner when she applied for the Old Age Non-Contributory Pension.  Further information supplied by the Solicitor for the Estate confirmed that monies amounting to €87,570.98 had not been disclosed.  Accordingly, the deceased pensioner's entitlement to Old Age Non-Contributory Pension was reviewed and it was determined that she had been overpaid to the sum of €14,448.41.  The personal representative has been notified that this amount is due to be repaid to the department from the Estate of the deceased pensioner.This decision has been appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The personal representative of the Estate will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as a decision is made.

Of these 9,912 were in receipt of the full personal rate of €204.30 and 1,803 were in receipt of €100.00.  In the same week a further 1,820 claimants received Supplementary Welfare Allowance for jobseeker payments in this age category.  Of these 549 were in receipt of the full personal rate of €204.30 and 1,271 in receipt of €100.00.Detailed statistics of the number who have qualified for the €204.30 payment since May are not readily available.  In the intervening period some customers would have moved to the higher rate of payment for a variety of reasons to include having reached age 20; being married or co-habiting with a child dependant.  Others will have signed off having found work or commenced a course of training.

Based on the numbers in receipt of this rate since its introduction in late May and assuming that the number of persons affected continues to increase at a similar rate, the estimated savings in 2009 will be circa €6.7 million.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1100	I propose to take Questions Nos. 859, 860 and 862 together.The April Supplementary Budget introduced a limited number of social welfare measures, including a 100 per week rate of jobseeker's allowance for certain new claimants aged 18 and 19.  The new rate of payment was introduced in order to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and to avoid them becoming welfare dependent from a young age.  The full rate of the relevant allowance is paid without regard to their age to 18 and 19 year olds who:Participate in a full-time Youthreach course for young early school leavers or a full-time course in a Senior Traveller Training Centre;Qualify for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) for pursuing a full-time second level course or Post Leaving Cert course, orParticipate in a full-time F-S training course.They can also participate on a PLC course or third level course on the same basis as any other young person and may qualify for a third level grant.The potential impact of this measure on poverty was considered and as a result it was decided that the new rate of payment would not impact on claimants with children or those who were formerly in the care of the HSE.  It also does not apply to those who have exhausted their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit.The proposals contained in the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes including the proposal therein in relation to the rate of weekly payment to persons on jobseeker's allowance aged between 20 and 24 years of age will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Estimates and Budget processes and in the light of available resources.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.  However, I can assure the Deputy that potential poverty impacts of any proposed changes to social welfare schemes will be considered.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1101	As you will be aware, the rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just under €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008 as a result of these increases and growth in the number of eligible children.  The Government was able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years.  However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to avoid excessive borrowing and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.It was in this context that the Minister for Finance announced in the Supplementary Budget the Government's intention to either subject CB to income tax or means-testing from 2010.  To this end, he requested the Commission on Taxation to examine and report on these options.  The Commission on Taxation and the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes have put forward proposals for changes to child benefit.  Any changes to Child Benefit would be for the Government to consider in a budgetary context.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will be mindful of the needs of families, particularly those on lower incomes.

There are currently 107 Family Resource Centres (FRCs) nationwide.  The total budget for the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme in 2009 is over €18m.The aim of this Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the function of the family unit.  The emphasis in Family Resource Centres (FRC) is on the involvement of the local community in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned.  FRCs assess the needs of their local communities and ensure that there are services and supports in place to address these needs.  They involve people from marginalised groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels in the project.The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, published on 16th July made a range of recommendations relating to the Department of Social and Family Affairs including that the Family Support Agency and most of its programmes be discontinued.  The Report’s recommendations are currently under consideration and a decision on these will be made in due course by Government.

There have been a number of developments in this scheme since its inception, including changes in the level of the bonus payment, the introduction of a minimum payment and the extension of the categories of eligible claimants.Each year the Government makes a decision on the payment of the Christmas bonus having regard to the prevailing economic circumstances.  This year it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure so as to restore order and stability to the public finances.  In this context, the decision was made that the Christmas bonus would not be paid in 2009.  The decision was announced in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget to give people advance notice so that they could adjust their finances accordingly.The money advice and budgeting service (MABS) which provides assistance for people with debt difficulties, operates from 65 locations throughout the country, and can be contacted either through a National Telephone Helpline or a website.  The Government is providing almost €18 million this year to the MABS to enable them to assist people with managing their finances and coping with debt problems.

One of the conditions for receipt of Jobseekers Allowance is that the person must be habitually resident in the State.  The habitual residence condition requires the applicant to satisfy that they meet certain conditions, including that their centre of interest is in Ireland and that their future intentions, as demonstrated, are to remain in Ireland.  The person concerned was found not to be habitually resident in the State.  Accordingly, his application was disallowed and he was notified of this decision on 2 September 2009 and of his right of Appeal.A notice of appeal has been forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

In order to qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or for 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who participate in the National Employment Action Plan process or engage with the Department's facilitator programme.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.A self-employed person who finds that their business is no longer viable may qualify for job seeker's allowance subject to a means test.  The means test involves an assessment of the person's savings and investments, any property they may own excluding the family home, and income from other sources including self-employment.  A self-employed person who qualifies for jobseeker's allowance can access the back to education allowance provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions of the scheme. In such cases payment is made at the equivalent of the maximum personal rate of jobseeker's allowance and there is no requirement to abandon the self-employment activity.

Credits are awarded to help protect the social insurance entitlements of insured people during periods when they may not be in a position to pay contributions.  In order to qualify for credits an individual must have at least 1 PRSI paid contribution at PRSI Class A, B, C, D, E or H.  It is also necessary to have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two complete income tax years, prior to claiming.  Credits awarded in respect of the Invalidity Pension are reckonable towards the State Pension (Contributory), subject, of course, to other criteria being satisfied.

This scheme is intended as an option of last resort and a social protection measure to assist pension schemes where the employer is insolvent and the pension scheme is in deficit and is being wound up.  The PIPS is intended to make it cheaper to pay for the pensions of retired pension scheme members, so that more money is available for the pension benefits of those who have not yet retired.This scheme uses the definition of insolvency as set out in the insolvency payments scheme administered by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and as set out in the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act 1984.  It is considered appropriate in the context of the PIPS scheme to use the definition of insolvency as set out in the 1984 Act.  It is not intended to propose any change to this definition.

Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions.  The exceptions apply to both men and women in family employment and recognise the practical difficulties in establishing the nature of a genuine employment relationship in such circumstances.  However, the legislation provides the scope necessary to allow spouses or assisting relatives to enter into formal arrangements for a contract of employment or self-employment whereby PRSI contributions will be payable.On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, ‘Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements', was developed to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published in 2008.  The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other Social Welfare benefits.  Application for benefits would take place in the usual way, following any approval of an application for commercial partnership status and the payment of any resulting PRSI liabilities.  The leaflet may be of interest to self-employed workers and their spouses generally.  Persons interested in applying for partnership status should firstly study a copy of the leaflet, available from the Information Section of the Department or at www.welfare.ie, which sets out the application procedure in detail.

In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the Live Register and the continuing contraction in employment, it was decided to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment.  The short term enterprise allowance (STEA), introduced from 1 May 2009, provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for Jobseekers' Benefit wish to set up a business. Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit.The qualifying period required for jobseekers on the live register to access to the back to work enterprise allowance scheme has been reduced from 2 years to 12 months provided the person has an entitlement to jobseeker's allowance. Those who do not have an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance can access the scheme, as before, subject to the 2 year qualifying period. The period for which the allowance is payable is 2 years at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second year. People who were in receipt of the allowance before 1 May 2009 will continue to be eligible for the scheme for the full four year period and will continue to be paid their entitlements. Furthermore, people who previously participated in the back to work enterprise allowance scheme may apply a second time after a period of at least 5 years has elapsed.These changes significantly strengthen the supports for jobseekers wishing to move to self employment. The qualifying conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changing economic circumstances.

Currently the standard monthly rates of child benefit in respect of single births are €166.00 in respect of each of the first and second child and € 203.00 for the third and subsequent children. In addition, with regard to multiple births, parents of twins are paid child benefit at one and a half times the standard monthly rate for each qualified child. Child benefit is paid in respect of multiple births of triplets or greater at double the normal monthly rate for each qualified child. Furthermore a special grant of €635.00 is paid in respect of multiple births at the birth and further grants of €635.00 when the children reach age 4 and 12 years.As you will be aware, the rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Overall expenditure on child benefit has grown from just under €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008 as a result of these increases and growth in the number of eligible children.  The Government was able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years.  However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public expenditure programmes, including social welfare programmes, so as to avoid excessive borrowing and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.It was in this context that the Minister for Finance announced in the Supplementary Budget the Government's intention to subject CB to either income tax or means-testing from 2010.  To this end, he requested the Commission on Taxation to examine and report on this option.  I am informed by the Minister for Finance that he will consider recommendations in relation to child benefit recently presented by the Commission on Taxation and proposals contained in The Report of Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, in the context of overall taxation policy and the prevailing social and economic environment.

This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested Jobseekers Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  It is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years and this is factored in projecting future earnings, with account being taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.

The short term enterprise allowance (STEA), introduced from 1 May 2009, provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for Jobseekers' Benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit.The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependant on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years; 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  The qualifying period required for access to back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is 12 months provided a person has an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance.Under both schemes, those taking up self-employment must first have their self-employment project approved as viable and sustainable.  In partnership areas this will be done by the partnership company.  In non-partnership areas this will be done by the department's local facilitator. Approval normally involves an interview with the applicant to assess the viability of the proposed project, to provide advice on funding or on "Start Your Own Business" courses and other relevant aspects.In the context of the STEA and BTWEA schemes, the Department operates a technical assistance and training scheme (TATS) under which a participant may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of €1,000 towards certain business start-up expenses. This fund is designed to enhance the person's prospects of succeeding in becoming independent of the social welfare system through support for training in the areas of starting a business, book-keeping/accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training or assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment. It is administered through the department's facilitator network based in social welfare local offices.  In addition local County Enterprise Boards offer support and advice to persons setting up their own business.

The person concerned was in receipt of rent supplement of €52 a week.  The Supplementary Budget earlier this year provided that the weekly minimum contribution which a rent supplement recipient must pay towards his/her rent be increased from €18 to €24, with effect from 1 June 2009.Payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants were also reduced by 8% from the same date. These measures account for the reduction in the rent supplement payment of the person concerned to €42 a week.

These include recipients of State pension (transition), State pension (contributory and non-contributory), blind pension, widow's, widower's and invalidity pensions,  guardian's payment (contributory and non-contributory), one-parent family payment, carer's benefit and allowance, disability allowance, long-term jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and people in receipt of employment support payments.  The bonus is also payable to participants in the Rural Social Scheme, which was introduced in 2004, and operates under the aegis of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.Approximately 7,500 recipients of farm assist were paid the bonus in 2008.  Some customers whose claims were awarded retrospectively after the beginning of December would also have received the bonus but it is not possible to ascertain the number of such claims at this time.  Fish assist is not a scheme in its own right.  It is jobseeker's allowance with a more favourable means test applied.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	I propose to take Questions Nos. 951 and 952 together.The determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance with section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, which directs the deciding officer to consider all the circumstances of the case, including five specified factors which have been derived from European Court of Justice case law — the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other country; the length and purpose of any absence from the State; the nature and pattern of the person's employment; the person's main centre of interest; and the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.  With regard to the five factors, the Department's guidelines state:No single factor is conclusive. The evidential weight to be attributed to each factor will depend on the circumstances of each case.  It is necessary to weigh up all the information and balance the evidence for and against an applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition.In commenting on the employment factor, emphasis is put on the nature and pattern of employment and, although the duration of employment is taken into consideration, no concept of a minimum period is suggested.  The EU regulations provide that an EEA national who has been in genuine and effective employment since arrival here shall enjoy the same social advantages as Irish nationals.  In this context, supplementary welfare allowance may be granted under certain circumstances without application of the habitual residence condition to EEA nationals whose employment here has ceased.  The duration of their employment here — whether it was less or more than one year — will determine whether such entitlement will be limited to six months.If the person had less than one year's employment, entitlement at the end of the six-month period will be subject to the habitual residence condition in the normal way.  Decisions in relation to all such claims are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers in the Department of Social and Family Affairs or, in relation to supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement, by HSE community welfare officers. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.  Each claim for a payment which is subject to the habitual residence condition is checked initially to see if sufficient information has been given on the claim form to determine whether the condition is satisfied.  If necessary, the claimant is asked to supply further details so a deciding officer can make a decision based on all the relevant facts.In the case of jobseeker's allowance and certain other payments, decisions are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by deciding officers in those offices at local office level.  Complex cases that require detailed consideration may be sent to a central section for determination.  Decisions in relation to other schemes are decided in headquarter scheme sections.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	Since its introduction, the underlying objective of the back to education allowance scheme has been to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.  It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full-time education and would not otherwise be able to do so.  The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.  Changes to provide for earlier access to the scheme were announced in the recent supplementary budget.  To qualify for participation, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for three months if pursuing a second level course, or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to nine months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department's facilitator programme.People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and recipients of jobseekers' payments who are out of formal education for at least two years can qualify at 18 years of age.  The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.  The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.  The person concerned applied for a back to education allowance — third level option.  Her application was disallowed on the grounds that she was not in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for the required period.

It is planned that successful applicants will commence their cadet training before the end of the year.  The military authorities have advised that in relation to the Air Corps there is no requirement to recruit Cadets in 2009.  This position is a function of the number of serving pilots, the number in training, the number of retirements and other anticipated departures.

The executive summary of the assessment states:In summary, a comprehensive shallow soil and air quality investigation and risk assessment was undertaken at the Naval Base and Naval Dockyard at Haulbowline Island.  The results have concluded that based on the monitoring carried out to date, there is no unacceptable risk to human health from airborne dust, vapours or emissions from the former Irish Steel site and East Tip sites. Likewise, there are no unacceptable risks posed by dry deposition of dusts on shallow soils on the Naval Base or Naval Dockyard from the East Tip or main former Irish steel site.There are no recommendations in the assessment concerning the provision of health screening for personnel based on Haulbowline Island and their families.  Arising from the assessment, no health screening of the personnel based on Haulbowline Island has taken place.  The full text of the assessment carried out by RPS Consultants is available on my Department's website.

These policies are covered in training and have been clearly communicated throughout the Defence Forces.  The Defences Forces promulgated a Defence Forces imagery policy in April 2007.  This policy prohibits personnel from posting inappropriate images or material in public on-line fora.  It advises that all such imagery will be investigated and appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated if necessary.I am advised that the matter of the article contained in the Sunday Mirror on 16 August last continues to be under review by the Military Authorities.  The images referred to in the article have been removed from the BEBO site.  The Reserve Defence Forces members concerned have been paraded by their unit commanders and informed that their actions were contrary to the policy in question.  While no disciplinary action was initially recommended at unit level, a final determination on whether disciplinary action will be taken has yet to be made.

This means that every Government Department takes responsibility for managing those emergencies that fall with its remit, including any legislative requirements.  The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I chair, meets on a regular basis.  There have been 60 meetings since it was established in 2001.  The Task Force provides a forum for sharing information and keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Departments.  In my role as chair of the Task Force, I submit an annual report on emergency planning to the Government.  The report outlines the progress made and sets out the challenges faced across the emergency planning spectrum.  I am satisfied that the existing arrangements are working well and that the lead Department structure is an effective one.  I have no plans, therefore, to introduce new legislative arrangements in this area.

It has designated nine gateways and nine hubs which have the capacity to grow sustainably and to act as drivers of growth for their hinterlands and wider regions.  Investment priorities identified under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and Transport 21 have been aligned with the national spatial strategy.  As a result, the gateways and hubs are benefiting substantially from significant infrastructure and enabling investment.The implementation of the strategy is also facilitated by the 2004 regional planning guidelines, which are under review.  City and county councils have regard to the strategy and to regional priorities in their development plan and local area planning processes.  My Department has undertaken extensive research into the development issues and challenges of the nine hub towns.  This work culminated in the publication in June 2007 of the report, NSS Hubs — Development Issues and Challenges, which is available on the Department's website, www.environ.ie.  The study provides a detailed description of the current status of the hubs, identifies the many development issues and challenges associated with the hubs and makes recommendations to support and advance future hub growth and development.  Key among the recommendations is the need for the establishment of implementation and co-ordination arrangements at the hub level and this is being encouraged and facilitated by my Department.  The 2008 Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, Building Ireland’s Smart Economy, indicated that an analysis of the implementation of the strategy was to be undertaken.  This work will be completed shortly by my Department.

Under the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 to 2007, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the EPA of any of its statutory functions.  Prior to any redevelopment of the Irish Glass Bottle site, the former IPPC-licensed activities at the site must be decommissioned and any contamination resulting from IPPC activities must be fully remediated.  In addition, the IPPC licence holder must apply to the EPA to surrender the IPPC licence when the decommissioning and closure requirements have been met.I understand that Becbay Limited's remediation strategy to deal with the IPPC licensed activities that took place at the IGB site was based on a Closure, Restoration and Aftercare Management Plan that was generated in full consultation and agreement with the EPA.  The Annual Report of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for 2008 has been submitted to me by the Authority.  I understand that the annual accounts for 2008 are being finalised and will be submitted to me in the coming weeks, following which I will arrange for the annual report and accounts to be laid before both Houses.  The authority's annual accounts are audited by independent external auditors.I wrote to the chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority on 17 August requesting that a comprehensive review of corporate governance be undertaken within the authority and that a report be submitted to me in October.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority is specifically excluded from the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Second Schedule of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  I am considering a request from the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee to have the authority included in the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This would require primary legislation.

My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Housing and Local Services, Deputy Finneran, recently held a meeting with representatives of the correspondent organisation in question in regard to Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007, in particular the technical assessment process.  Part 3 of the Act provides for registration of the title of "architect".  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, as the relevant registration body, has established an admissions board and a technical assessment board so that the registration process may commence in the near future.  The RIAI has appointed architects to the boards.  I have appointed the chairpersons and non-architect majority to both boards.  The fees for technical assessment and registration are subject to my approval, prior to introduction.  Details of proposed fees were recently forwarded to me by the registration body.  I will give those proposals full and careful consideration before making a decision.Section 14 of the Act sets out the eligibility criteria for registration in the statutory register of architects.  Section 21 provides for the establishment of the technical assessment board which will set out the criteria for assessment and consider applications for registration from people who have been practising architecture in the State for a minimum period of ten years.  Section 22 sets out the procedures for the operation of the technical assessment board.  The Act provides for an appeal against a decision of the technical assessment board to an appeals board which will be appointed shortly.   The appeals board will also have an independent chairperson and a majority of lay members.  There is ultimately an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the appeals board or any other board or committee.  Once statutory registration has formally commenced, it will be an offence under sections 18(1)(a) and 18(1)(d) of the Act  to use the title of “architect” unless registered on the statutory register.  Architects may still continue to practice but will be unable to use the title.  However, section 18(5) of the Act provides that paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection 1 will not apply:(i) where a person has applied for registration to either the Admissions Board or the Technical Assessment Board and where a decision has not been made on the application;(ii) where a decision is awaited on an appeal to the Appeals Board against a decision of either Board referred to, or;(iii) where a decision is awaited on an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Appeals Board, subject to the requirement that the application for registration to the Admissions Board or the Technical Assessment Board, or the appeal to either the Appeals Board or the High Court, has not been withdrawn.

In so far as the collection networks at the various locations are concerned, the Tallow and Kilmacthomas waste water collection systems have been completed.  I recently approved funding to allow the Cappoquin collection system contract go to construction.In relation to the Stradbally collection system, I understand that the council has completed its assessment of the tenders received and will shortly submit its tender recommendation to my Department for approval of the necessary funding.  The council is preparing the contract documents for the collection systems at the remaining three locations.  The waste water treatment plants for the seven locations are being procured under a single contract, the contract documents for which were recently received and are under examination in my Department.   Additional information has been requested from the council to enable my Department to do a full assessment of these documents.  As a short-term measure, I also recently approved funding for the provision of interim treatment facilities at Ardmore pending the construction of the treatment plant there.

The plans were subject to public consultation for six months up to 22 June 2009.  The plans, which are scheduled to be adopted by the end of the year, will specify the environmental objectives to be achieved in respect of our water bodies and the measures to be implemented to achieve these objectives.  The programmes of measures must be operational by the end of 2012.  The nitrates directive, which is one of 11 key EU directives on water protection, is classed as one of the basic measures for implementation of the water framework directive.The implementation of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) Regulations 2009 and the current nitrates action programme are, therefore, key elements of the river basin management plans.  It is expected that full compliance with the good agricultural practice regulations will contribute significantly to reducing the impact of agriculture on water quality.  In certain circumstances, however, additional measures may be required to meet all of the environmental objectives set out in the river basin management plans.  The need for any such additional measures will be considered in the course of the review of the current nitrates action programme, which is due to take place before the end of this year.  The next nitrates action programme is to be published by 30 June 2010.

I published the report, entitled A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland, for consultation in February 2009.  The report is available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.  Written submissions received to date as part of the consultation process are currently being considered.  While the formal closing date for written submissions has passed, I will still welcome and consider any views and observations that are put forward by interested individuals and organisations.In developing and bringing forward proposals for the establishment of an Electoral Commission, I will take into account the report prepared by the UCD group and views put forward as part of the consultation process.

The strategy was developed under the aegis of a Cross Departmental Team, which provides a forum for addressing cross-cutting issues, particularly in terms of preventing homelessness.The National Implementation Plan for the new strategy, published in April 2009, sets out priority actions with constituent supporting measures and identifies the agencies/bodies with the lead role in individual areas.  The issues raised are all matters for which lead responsibility, under the Implementation Plan, has been assigned to Departments and Agencies other than my Department.  Specifically, the Implementation Plan indicates that lead responsibility for issues in relation to discharge planning from health services and prisons are the responsibility of the HSE and the Irish Prison Service, respectively.  In relation to the development of national guidance on delivery of education, training and work opportunities for people who are homeless, this has been identified as a priority action for the Department of Education and Science and FÁS.The Implementation Plan also identifies as a key action, under its Preventative chapter, the necessity to examine issues relating to youth homelessness as a route to adult homelessness.  This examination will also consider the issue of interaction between youth homeless fora and the adult homeless consultative fora.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1213	I propose to take Questions Nos. 988 to 990, inclusive, and 992 to 994, inclusive,  together.Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2008, rising from €1.5m to €4m.  The latter figure is being maintained in 2009, bringing total funding allocations since 2004 to €15m. Details of the amounts paid to each local authority in respect of the years 2004 — 08 and of the first funding tranche for 2009 are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie and in the Oireachtas Library. The funding is allocated to local authorities on the basis of a formula which takes into account inspection targets for the particular year and actual inspections carried out. The methodology for the payment of funding for 2010 is kept under review by my Department.In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years with the number of inspections more than doubling — from 6,815 to 17,202 — in the period 2005 to 2008.  More detailed information on the number of inspections carried out each year up to and including 2008 is included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are also available on my Department's website.  The 2008 data, published in August 2009, indicate a further year on year increase in activity of approximately 23%, with over 17,200 inspections completed in 2008. This further significant increase reflects the positive impact of the overall Action Programme on Standards, including increased funding, introduced on foot of a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, and the ongoing progress with the implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme.It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide on the specific details of its inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the private rented sector, my Department encourages authorities to have regard to the report — Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement — published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on matters relevant to inspection procedures such as identifying and targeting inspection requirements.The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body in September 2004 and has its principal functions in the areas of: The registration of private rental tenancies; The resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords; The provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private rental sector.While the PRTB deals with disputes between landlords and tenants, including issues relating to standards, unlike local authorities it does not have local inspection staff. Local authorities, with local inspection staff who carry out a wide range of functions in relation to housing generally, are best placed to undertake the enforcement of the minimum standards regulations for rented houses. It would be neither practical nor economical to centralise this role in the PRTB or another independent body.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1214	The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body in September 2004 and its principal functions are in the areas of: The registration of private rental tenancies; The resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords; The provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private rental sector.The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (RTA) requires the registration of most residential tenancies and more than 200,000 active tenancies are currently registered with the PRTB. This compares favourably with the situation prior to the establishment of the PRTB when no more than 30,000 tenancies were registered with the local authorities.The PRTB compiles its tenancy data on a rolling, aggregate basis as valid tenancy registration forms are submitted to it. It should be noted in this regard that more than one tenancy may be registered in respect of a rented accommodation unit in any year. Furthermore the Act provides for a four year tenancy cycle and the re-registration of the tenancy at the end of each cycle.I understand that at 30 June 2009 the PRTB had 219,453 active tenancies on its register, representing 376,631 tenants and 108,319 landlords.  End of year figures for the preceding four years, as per the PRTB's Annual Reports, are set out hereunder in tabular form.

Section 138 of the Act allows the Board to vary such fees in line with changes in the value of money; to date, no such variations have been made.By Ministerial Direction of 24 February 2005, two-sevenths of fees received by the PRTB under section 137 of the Act were retained by the PRTB to defray administration costs, and the balance was to be transferred to local authorities for the purpose of the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to private rented accommodation e.g. rental standards inspections and rent book regulations.The fee income received by the PRTB over the past 4 years has remained relatively constant and it is currently in the order of €7.8m per annum.  The payment to the local authorities of the monies allocated to them from the fee income stream is dependent on the levels of inspection performance by the authorities.  Those levels have increased significantly in recent years and funding for inspections more than doubled between 2005 and 2008, rising from €1.5m to €4m. This level of funding will be maintained in 2009, bringing funding allocations for this purpose since 2004 to €15m.While local authorities' inspections performance has improved year on year, and the monies allocated to that end have also increased, a reserve of unused funds held by the PRTB in a fiduciary capacity for the local authorities has accumulated since 2004 and now stands at approximately €10m. In line with a policy of moving the PRTB towards self-sufficiency, the annual grant from my Department to the PRTB has been reduced over a number of years from €5.7 million in 2007 to €3.8 million in 2008 and to €1 million in 2009.In light of the above-mentioned accumulated fund, and to facilitate increased financial self-sufficiency, I made a Ministerial Direction on 26 March 2009 providing that, four-sevenths of fees received by the PRTB under section 137 of the Act be retained to defray the administrative expenses of the Board. I directed that three-sevenths be transferred to local authorities for the purpose of the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts.This restructured arrangement, taking account of the accumulated fund, provides a strong platform from which to fund more onerous inspection activities in light of the new Rented Accommodation Standards Regulations which I introduced on 1 February 2009, and also increases the PRTB's financial self-sufficiency.  My Department will continue to monitor this funding situation closely.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1221	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1004 to 1009, inclusive, together.As previously advised, the Government has considered the position in relation to the former Irish Steel/Ispat site at Haulbowline noting the outcome of the site investigations, the requirement for various works and further monitoring recommended by the environmental consultants and the development issues, particularly technical constraints, site boundary issues, zoning issues and regulatory requirements, meriting early address.The Government has decided that the Office of Public Works (OPW) will chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site. The establishment of this group is a matter for the OPW, and I understand that arrangements to establish the group are underway.  Future funding requirements are contingent on the determination as to the future use of the site.From 2004 to 2009 my Department, had an interim role in the management of this legacy site in a manner which is consistent with good practice and minimisation of risk to human health and the environment. Accordingly, the Department arranged for the decontamination and demolition of the buildings on site and, post-demolition, arranged for the procurement of a contractor for site surface clearance, back filling of voids and the disposal of the remaining surface wastes to be undertaken.Examples of waste types removed since 2004 include: licensed radioactive sources and low-level radioactive waste; over 10,000 tonnes of scrap metal; over 1,100 tonnes of hazardous dust vacuumed from the steelworks buildings before demolition; contaminated filter bags from the steelworks dust extraction system; various forms of asbestos removed from the steelworks buildings before demolition; refractory waste; transformer oil; electrical capacitors  — PCB and non-PCB; sulphur hexafluoride gas from circuit breakers; assorted gas cylinders; battery acid; millscale; disturbed hazardous soils/sludges; hazardous liquid waste.To date the State has expended c.€50 million on investigations, site works, disposal of waste material, testing and sampling, analysis, topographical and foreshore ecological surveys, project management, professional fees and security.Following the uncovering by sub-contractors of Hammond Lane Metal Co. Ltd of a sub-surface hazardous sludge pit in summer 2008 my Department engaged consultants White Young Green to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions, comprising three distinct modules:1. assessing the quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity;2. assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by current site conditions; and3. ambient air monitoring.The consultants had available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority.Ambient air monitoring was undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international occupational exposure limit values, finding that air quality complied with all relevant standards and guidelines, including in Cobh which was the main population centre that was monitored, and that there is no occupational risk to human health from airborne substances. Similarly, the assessment of water, sediment and mussel samples employed the relevant applicable screening criteria and found no identifiable risk to the residents of Cork Harbour.In the case of assessing the health and environmental risks posed by potential contaminants in the waste material on the East Tip itself the screening was undertaken using human health generic assessment criteria which are derived from guidance issued in the UK. These criteria were considered most appropriate for the site, are conservative for on-site exposures for current land use, and did not suggest a risk to health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork Harbour area including the Naval Base.The total amount spent on the site assessment was €394,948.61. This comprised all costs associated with environmental testing, analysis, monitoring and reporting in respect of assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity; assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by the site conditions and ambient air monitoring.Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Regulations it is the duty of each employer to ensure that health surveillance is made available for every employee, appropriate to the health and safety risks that may be incurred at the workplace.  Significant hazards must be reported in this context to the Health and Safety Manager. Department staff wear the appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) when out on site. Where particular concerns arise in relation to possible exposure to health risks in the workplace, provision is made by the Department for appropriate screening to be carried out.  The advice of the Chief Medical Officer would also be sought in this context.In relation to the site at Haulbowline the comprehensive site investigations which were conducted in 2005 and 2008 by White Young Green concluded that while there is significant contamination of the site it posed no immediate threat to human health or the environment in the area.In the context of the introduction of the licensing system provided for in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 the facility in question applied for, and was granted by the EPA, an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) Licence. Such licences encompass the full range of environmental impacts of an activity, including in respect of the management of wastes arising as a result of the activity. However, the company went into liquidation before the conditions in the licence could be met and the liquidator applied to the High Court seeking to disclaim the IPC licence. The judgement, on 29 July 2004, found as a matter of fact that the IPC licence was granted after the company had ceased production of steel and that the conditions of the licence could not be applied retrospectively.  A lacuna thus arose as regards the regulatory status of the facility.Necessarily, the resolution of this must involve a determination as to the future use of the site and thus the appropriate regulatory arrangements which should apply to it. The regulatory status of the site is currently the subject of a complaint to the EU and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.

These schemes, introduced on 1 November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department, together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. The older Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs grant schemes are funded by 67% recoupment, together with a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority. The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment and approval of individual applications, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.The annual allocations to local authorities under the schemes are calculated on foot of detailed discussion between my Department and the local authorities and on the basis of a number of criteria, including the level of applications on hand that have been assessed as eligible, applications yet to be assessed and projections for new applications to be received during the year.   It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.Details of Exchequer funding provided to Mayo County Council for these schemes for the years 2007 and 2008 and total allocations for 2009 from Exchequer and local authority sources are set out in the following table:200720082009€1,630,838€2,011,125€2,775,834In order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability, and following a review of the old  Disabled Persons, Essential Repairs Grant Schemes and Special Housing aid for the Elderly, which was administered by the HSE, a revised suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes was implemented on 1 November 2007.  The revised schemes target the available resources to those in most need, streamline operational and administrative procedures and ensure equity and consistency of operation across all local authority areas.The number of applications on hand in Mayo County Council at the end of December 2008, representing the most recent data notified to my Department , is set out in the following table:Mayo County CouncilApplications on hand at 31 Dec. 2008Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability119Mobility Aids Grant249Housing Aid for Older People570Details regarding the current status of individual applications and the number of applications received by Mayo County Council on an annual basis under each of the various grant measures are not available in my Department.  I will review the funding position in the light of any under-spend by local authorities of their allocations for the grant schemes or other allocations under the wider social housing investment programme.

There are no plans to abolish the claw-back arrangements under the existing affordable housing schemes.Provision has been made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 for the introduction of new Affordable Dwelling purchase arrangements to replace existing affordable housing schemes.  Under these, the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the affordable purchaser's perspective. However, instead of units being sold at a discounted price, with the value of the discount being subject to a reducing clawback, the State will take an equity stake in affordable units sold. The purchaser will have the option of either buying out the remaining equity in steps or at the end of a fixed period.  Until the new arrangements are formally commenced, the existing clawback arrangements will continue to apply in relation to the purchase of affordable housing.

The most important exemption under the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is for a person's sole or main residence.  However, any one individual can have only one such residence. The Act, which imposes a modest charge on non-principal private residences to support the provision of local services where the properties concerned are located, does not seek to differentiate between such residences left vacant by the owner or made available for rent as the case may be.

The balance was met by local authorities from non-Exchequer sources and through water charges in respect of services provided to the non-domestic sector.  Figures are not yet available for expenditure relating to the delivery of water services for 2008.  However, the local authorities' Annual Financial Statements indicated that the operational cost of delivering water services amounted to €680 million in 2007.  Local authorities collected €169 million from water charges levied on non domestic users during 2007.

The National Water Study, undertaken by my Department in 2000, estimated that average daily water consumption in Ireland was 145 litres per person per day and more recent estimates by the EPA have put average daily water consumption at 148 litres per person per day.The UK's Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has indicated that between 2001 and 2006, average consumption in metered households was 134 litres per person per day, and in un-metered households was 152 litres per person per day.  Up-to-date information regarding water consumption across the EU is not available.  However, the European Environment Agency has indicated that average consumption for all household purposes in the European Economic Area in 2001 was approximately 150 litres per person per day.  A more recent report, published by Eurostat in November 2007, showed per capita consumption in southern Member States, such as Spain and Portugal, as well as some Nordic countries in excess of 160 litres per person per day.   Consumption in more centrally located States and the Baltic Member States was stated to be well below this level.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1228	The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste, i.e. the natural or legal person in possession of the waste, or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Acts 1996-2008 impose a general duty of care on holders of waste.  A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. In addition, in the case of hazardous waste, a holder of waste is required, without delay, to inform both the local authority concerned and the EPA of any loss, spillage, accident or other development concerning that waste which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to deal with any instances of illegal disposal of waste in their functional area and take the appropriate enforcement action.  Any incidents of illegal waste activity should be reported to the local authority who have significant powers available to them under the Waste Management Acts to deal with the waste.  Asbestos is a hazardous waste and its management requires care, including relevant health and safety requirements. Further general information on asbestos, including disposal, can be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency's website:http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/advice/asbestos/

I expect to be in a position to issue a response shortly.  Under the Urban Waste Water Directive, Member States are required to reuse, where possible, the sludge arising from the treatment of waste water.  The use of sewage sludge in agriculture is the primary area for reuse in Ireland, and is governed by the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations 1998 -2001.  A code of practice for the use of sewage sludge in agriculture has also been prepared.Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency established a Working Group to consider issues surrounding the management of sewage sludge.  My Department is participating in this group, which also includes representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Teagasc and the local authorities.  The Working Group will be considering, inter alia, the arrangements for both the transportation and storage of sewage sludge.

This process has included discussions with a number of organisations, bodies, public agencies and interests active in this area.  The issues involved are complex and required detailed consideration following the recommendations of the Working Group which examined the regulation of dog breeding establishments.  The recommendations included a definition of a dog breeding establishment as ‘a premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential.Following advice, it is my intention to introduce amending legislation in this area at the earliest opportunity.  My proposals in this regard are at an advanced stage and will be published as soon as possible.  The proposed legislation will apply to all dogs including hunting dogs and greyhounds.  The proposals will provide for registration, inspection and regulation of all dog breeding establishments together with payment of registration fees, minimum standards, maintenance of records and related provisions.With regard to groups affiliated to the Hunting Association of Ireland (HAI), I propose to exempt such groups from the requirement to pay registration fees as they have indicated that they operate on a not for profit basis.  However, in order to ensure that proper standards apply to all dog breeding establishments, commercial and otherwise, it is my intention that such premises operated by the HAI will be subject to regulation, registration and inspection, with a requirement to adhere to proper veterinary and welfare standards and other conditions as may be specified.  As the HAI informs me that it operates a comprehensive standards regime at present, it is not expected that the new regulatory regime will place a significant additional burden on their affiliated groups.

For these sites, the derogation given by the Government, which allowed the continuation of turf cutting for personal domestic use, expires in 2009.  The person in question in this case owns land within Crit Island West, a Natural Heritage Area designated in 2004, and the 10 year derogation period will not expire until 2014.  Land transactions within this area, accordingly, will not qualify for priority attention this year.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1235	National waste statistics for all waste streams are independently produced and published by the EPA.  National Waste Reports have been published in respect of the years 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2006 with interim reports published for 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007 respectively.  No report has yet been published in respect of 2008.  These reports are available on the Agency's website: www.epa.ie.  While there is no specific information available to my Department on the volumes of food waste consigned to landfill, the National Waste Reports provide data in relation to the organic fraction of the municipal waste stream.  Organic waste, in broad terms, is taken to mean food and garden waste arising in the domestic and commercial sectors.The recent National Waste Report 2007, published in January 2009, estimated that a total of 839,806 tonnes, or 91.4%, of organic waste was landfilled in 2007. Improving our recovery rates for organic waste represents a considerable challenge and one that must be addressed as a matter of urgency if Ireland is to achieve its prescribed diversion targets for biodegradable municipal waste under Directive 99/31/EC on the landfill of waste (the Landfill Directive).  Meeting these targets will entail doubling the existing levels of diversion of biodegradable municipal waste, which includes organic waste, from landfill by 2010 with exponential increases in diversion in the subsequent target years of 2013 and 2016 respectively.Following extensive consultations, a National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and sets out measures aimed at the separate collection, recovery and recycling of biodegradable municipal waste with a view to achieving the progressive diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill in accordance with our international obligations.  The Strategy envisages that 80% of biodegradable municipal waste will be diverted from landfill by 2016, with the separate collection and subsequent biological treatment of organic waste to generate compost having a critical role to play in minimising the use of landfill into the future.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implementation of the National Strategy.In 2008, a circular issued to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins for domestic householders and to promote the use of home composting.  I have also signalled my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow for significant increases in the landfill levy to act as a further deterrent to landfill.  In addition, my Department is working with industry towards the development of a statutory instrument to require the source segregation and appropriate treatment of food waste arising in the commercial sector.  This, I believe, has the potential to divert significant amounts of food waste from landfill towards more sustainable and environmentally beneficial practices.I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill and in an overall reduction in our use of landfill.

The most important exemption under the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is for principal private residences.  The charge is a point in time charge assessed on the liability date, which in 2009 is 31 July.  A property that is not suitable for use as a dwelling on the liability date should not be regarded as a dwelling within the meaning of the Act.  My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities for use when considering whether a house is habitable or not.If a person owns a property other than one that they reside in as their principal private residence, then it may be liable for the charge.  There is, however, a further specific exemption in the Act in the case of a property owned by an individual which is less than two kilometres from the principal private residence of that individual, and is occupied rent free by a relative.  Where a house is willed or gifted to an individual and a right of residence is retained by the original owner or occupier then the liability to pay the charge depends on whether the right of residence is exclusive.  If the right of residence is exclusive, the owner does not have an entitlement to seek or receive rent, and is, therefore, not an "owner" within the meaning of the Act until that right ceases to affect the property.

This programme will require significant investment of time and resources from public and private stakeholders in delivering the mixed use, mixed tenure sustainable communities envisaged over the period of implementation for the project.My Department is now finalising its consideration of the draft Masterplan with a view to its formal presentation to Government this Autumn with associated implementation plans.In regard to investment, over the period 2007-2008, my Department provided some €30 million for the support and development of the regeneration programme in the Moyross, Southill, Ballinacurra Weston, and St. Mary's Park areas of Limerick City, with a further €24.65 million provision for 2009.  The 2007-2008 funding was provided to both the Limerick Regeneration Agencies and Limerick City Council and has supported the establishment and operation of the Limerick Regeneration Agencies; the demolition of some 350 void properties; extensive estate clean-ups and environmental works; support for local educational and social initiatives; and the development of the vision plans and draft Masterplans.An agreed joint programme of physical, social and environmental regeneration activities is being funded from the 2009 allocation and implemented by Limerick Regeneration Agencies, Limerick City and Limerick County Councils and Clare County Council, including a specific budget allocation of €8.25m to cover the Limerick Regeneration Agency's costs and projects.  The programme facilitates the temporary relocation of households from the areas, both in terms of community stability and to facilitate construction works, as well as proceeding with the extensive planned demolitions.  Funding has been provided for the continuation of estate improvement works including wide-scale clean ups in the areas and specific community safety initiatives and social intervention projects. A project team has been established to deliver detailed plans for two new sheltered housing construction projects in the regeneration areas of Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston.  Some €1.5m has been provided in 2009 towards meeting these design costs.The broader economic and employment situation in Limerick and the Mid-West region is under consideration in light of the Interim Report of the Mid-West Task Force.  My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment published the Interim Reporton 28 July 2009 and the Government is committed to a cross-Departmental consultation process to evaluate and consider the implementation of the report's recommendations.  The report recommends inter alia the fast-tracking of the Limerick regeneration programme.Significant funding for the regeneration programme will continue to be provided in 2010, and the priorities involved will be reviewed as part of the respective October Housing Action Plan meetings between my Department, Limerick City and Limerick County Councils, Clare County Council and the Limerick Regeneration Agencies.  The specific funding allocations will be determined in light of the forthcoming meetings, wider Government decisions, the estimates process and the level of support available from key public and private stakeholders.

Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is achieved mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited.Under the original Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005 and both of these targets were achieved.  The National Waste Report 2007 states that the rate of packaging waste recovery reached 63.6% in that year, exceeding the target of 60% to be achieved by 2011 which was set by Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Packaging Directive.In 2007, in accordance with Government policy to prevent and minimise waste, I asked Irish Industry to develop a model similar to the Courtauld agreement on packaging waste in the U.K.  This agreement aims to reduce significantly the amount of packaging waste generated in the retail sector, with the principal focus being placed on the food retail multiples.  Discussions are continuing between Retail Ireland, Repak and my Department with a view to building on the successful management of packaging waste in Ireland and minimising the generation of such waste in the future.

The primary purpose of the clawback regime is to prevent short-term profit-taking on the resale of affordable homes.  As such, it should, therefore, only have effect in the event of the house being sold.  However, because of the way in which the clawback legislative arrangements are structured, they have an impact on affordable homeowners wishing to switch mortgage provider or take out an equity release "top-up" mortgage.  This arises because of the time-sensitive manner in which charges on property apply.While provision has been made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to allow purchasers under the new Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements to re-mortgage or top-up their mortgage without triggering the clawback, as enacted, the Act does not, in error, provide this facility for purchasers under existing affordable housing or shared ownership arrangements. I have requested my Department to arrange to have the relevant provisions included in the first appropriate legislative vehicle available to the Department.The operation of the various affordable housing schemes is primarily a matter for individual housing authorities and I have no function in relation to valuations of property made by a local authority in individual transactions.  A local authority may reconsider its valuation of a property in light of an independent valuation obtained by the owner; however, it is not obliged to accept this valuation. Any person who is not satisfied with a service or action of a local authority should in the first instance make a formal complaint to that authority. My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities regarding the establishment and operation of effective customer complaints systems. Complaints regarding the actions of a local authority may also be made to the Office of the Ombudsman.

The Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Act, 2007 empowered the Loughs Agency to conserve, protect, develop and manage shell fisheries and aquaculture in the Loughs areas, enabling for the first time the introduction of an agreed regulatory aquaculture and shell fisheries regime in Lough Foyle.The legal issues in relation to foreshore, aquaculture and shellfish licensing in Lough Foyle are being examined by the relevant authorities.  It will be necessary, however, for the Loughs Agency to secure foreshore licences for the cross-border foreshore areas in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Food and the Crown Estates Commission, which are the bodies responsible for the management of foreshore in both jurisdictions.This will facilitate the introduction of a structured management system for aquaculture in the Loughs areas with the objective of achieving sustainable development for the social, economic and environmental benefit of the communities that influence, enjoy and depend on its resource.  This will provide those involved in aquaculture surety of tenure and a degree of certainty as to future production prospects in relation to their operations in accordance with their licence conditions.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1258	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1064 and 1065 together.The primary motivation in aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of the wild salmon stocks.  It is important to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch in order to fulfil obligations under the Habitats Directive.It is not possible to relax the conservation measures other than where river stocks recover and it is established from the results of the scientific analysis conducted by the Marine Institute in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted.  It should be possible, in those circumstances, to exploit the identified surplus in rivers, bays and estuaries by all appropriate methods, within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive.  It is not envisaged that drift netting in the open seas will be licensed in the future.In regard to the recovery of wild salmon stocks in our rivers, the Standing Scientific Committee's report on the status of Irish Salmon stocks in 2008 and Precautionary Catch Advice for 2009 indicated that increases in returns in 2007 to fish counters and traps, which occurred immediately following the closure of the mixed stock fishery in 2006, were not sustained in all of salmonid rivers.  The Marine Institute estimate marine survival from the returns of over 300,000 tagged salmon annually and it is clear that this index is declining due to persistent but as yet unidentified problems at sea. Initial indications from the tag recovery programme for 2009 suggest that marine survival may have in fact declined even further.During 2009, the number of rivers open for salmon fishing was fifty, a reduction of six compared to 2008.  A further thirteen rivers were open for catch and release angling, which was eight less than in 2008.  The Standing Scientific Committee's analysis on the performance of the 2009 fishery will be conducted after the closure of the angling season at the end of September.  Preliminary catch data for the commercial season has, however, been compiled by the Central Fisheries Board as the season has already ended in all fishery districts.  The commercial harvest as a percentage of the river specific quotas available under the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations 2008 (SI 586, 2008) varied from river to river. In some rivers no fish were caught and in only two instances the full quota was caught.  Indications are that the overall catch rate at 32% was down by comparison to the catch rate in 2008 at 48%.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I can provide the following information.Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity supply market lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  The electricity supply market has been fully opened to competition since February 2005.  I am advised that there are a number of companies, including ESB Customer Supply, supplying electricity to local authorities for public lighting.Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of public lighting infrastructure resides with the local authorities and not with the ESB.  ESB Contracts, an unregulated division of ESB, provides a service to the local authorities to install and maintain public lighting.  The service generally covers the maintenance and provision of public lighting systems and equipment within the local authority area.  I understand that the provision of these services is open to competition and that there are contractors other than ESB Contracts already in the market.  Occasionally, this work is also undertaken by local authority staff.I can also confirm that following a strategic review of its public lighting business, ESB has decided to tender for a new owner for the business.  A formal commercial process is currently underway in this regard. My Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA) and the ESB are working very closely together to ensure all appropriate structures are in place to facilitate a smooth transition period and to ensure that local authorities are geared up for the further development of full competition in the public lighting market, in due course.

My Department is actively engaged in promoting opportunities for exploration for oil and gas offshore Ireland with the aim of attracting an increased share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland.The terms offered to companies exploring for oil and gas offshore Ireland have been carefully balanced to attract those willing to invest money in high-risk exploration while still giving the State a fair share of profits where a commercial discovery is made.New terms, which apply to all exploration licences awarded after the beginning of 2007, were put into effect in the 2008 Finance Act. They build on the 25% tax rate applicable to licences issued before 2007, to include an additional tax which is payable at rates of up to 15%; so total taxes payable will be 25-40% of profits, depending on the ratio of profit to the cost of bringing the field to production.In 1987, Ireland followed the lead of other countries such as the UK and Norway in moving away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system. Under a tax based system the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of the oil or gas field. Under a royalty system payments are linked to the volume of production and take no account of differences in development cost or actual profitability.When comparing Ireland's fiscal terms with those of our near neighbours it is important to have regard to the relative exploration success records. Countries such as France, Portugal and Spain have success records somewhat similar to Ireland, whereas the UK and Norway have had very significantly higher rates of success.For example, since 1970, 128 exploration wells and 28 appraisal wells have been drilled offshore Ireland and 4 commercial discoveries have been made. While in the UK by the end of 2007, 2314 exploration wells and 1604 appraisal wells had been drilled and 370 commercial discoveries have been declared to date.France applies a tax rate of 34.4% with no royalty payable; Portugal has a tax rate of 27.5% with no royalty except on oil production in shallow water and Spain imposes a tax rate of 30% with no royalty. As in Ireland, none of these countries' governments take a share of exploration or development projects.Countries such as the UK and Norway, that have experienced a much higher rate of successful exploration, can of course seek a higher return and still attract exploration investment. The UK has a tax rate of 50% on oil and gas production and in Norway the tax rate is between 28% and 78%.Neither country requires royalty payments. While the Norwegian government participates in exploration and production, it pays its full share of all costs and also pays the oil companies at least 28% of their exploration costs when exploration wells are unsuccessful.Under the existing regulatory framework exploration costs are borne entirely by the licence holders. State participation in exploration would mean that the Irish taxpayer would have to pay the cost of unsuccessful exploration wells.This would, in my view, place an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer as a single deepwater well in the Atlantic can cost in the region of €100 million.  On that basis I consider that it is the industry and not the State that should continue to take the risk associated with investment in exploration for oil and gas.

This means ensuring access to reliable supplies of energy at reasonable cost, while at the same time delivering radical improvements in the sustainability of energy use. The Deputy is also correct in asserting that there are a range of enterprise and employment benefits that spin off from this. The Government is taking a wide ranging approach to this, supporting basic and applied research in areas where we have a natural competitive advantage and adopting a set of supports to industry to ensure that we can deliver projects of sufficient scale.The general research areas include long standing programmes like the Renewable Energy Research Development and Demonstration programmes run by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), and the Charles Parsons Scheme of Energy Research which is administered by Science Foundation Ireland.The applied research area includes programmes like the Microgeneration Pilot Programme, the House of Tomorrow Programme and the Renewable Transport Programme.The Government is giving high priority to supporting the development of Ireland's ocean energy potential.  Not only will ocean energy contribute to Ireland's renewable energy targets, it has considerable potential for inward investment and enterprise activity in support of economic renewal.  The ocean energy package launched last year is designed to ensure Ireland is fully positioned to harness the rich potential of the technology.  Delivery entails close cooperation between Departments, agencies and the industry to deliver on the roadmap, which will transform ocean energy into a commercially viable industry.The dedicated Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) was established last year.  The Ocean Energy Unit launched the industry prototype development fund towards the end of 2008, and has also undertaken a detailed assessment process to identify the most suitable wave energy test site with a grid connection to the electricity network. The development partnership will now develop a grid connected site off Annagh, County Mayo.  This facility will test operational pre-commercial wave energy devices directly connected to the electricity network.The Government has also put in place a set of supports, ranging from capital supports for certain type of renewable energy technology, across the industrial, institutional and industrial sectors. These include the REFIT Scheme, a fixed feed in tariff system, which is leveraging investment in renewable electricity capacity, which is critical to Ireland delivering our targets under the Renewable Energy Directive.In addition the Commercial State Energy Companies, ESB, BGE and Bord na Móna have indicated strong commitment to investment in renewable energy consistent with their commercial mandate.  This commitment has already led to investment in various renewable energy projects.I am committed to ensuring that we maintain momentum on all fronts.  The work now under way will reap rich dividends for Ireland if we succeed in building the critical mass of knowledge skills and capability to test and develop the technology and systematically address the short to medium-term challenges.

I therefore have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.I am advised however that Gaslink, the Gas System Transmission Operator (a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann), in conjunction with Bord Gáis Networks has submitted its report to the CER on the Phase 3 assessment of towns not already connected to the natural gas network.  Tipperary town is included in a total of 42 towns examined as part of Phase 3 of this assessment.  The CER is currently examining the report which will be published by BGÉ shortly [and will indicate the overall CER assessment, including in relation to Tipperary town].

Ocean energy technologies are still in the research and development phase globally. Work towards the commercialisation of ocean energy technology continues in Ireland and abroad.A key priority under the ocean energy strategy is to increase the research and design capabilities in ocean energy in Ireland. The wave-tank facility at the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) University College Cork is Ireland's centre of excellence in ocean energy research, modelling and technical support for early stage device developers.The Government's ocean energy strategy includes a programme of grant support to companies developing full scale prototypes and the development of a test site for full scale electricity generation off County Mayo. The prototype fund administered by the Ocean Energy Development Unit of SEI has provided financial support this year to more than 7 companies to date.  While the inherent challenges of ocean energy and the nature of this frontier technology are complex the growing interest and involvement of large engineering companies and utilities in Ireland and globally indicate the accelerating pace of development.The Ocean Energy Development Unit is continuing work on the establishment of the grid connected wave energy test facility off County Mayo. The Ocean Energy Development Unit also liaises closely with Northern Ireland colleagues on a number of initiatives, designed to deliver the benefits of ocean energy development for the economy of the island as a whole. A tidal device is already connected to the Northern Irish grid at Strangford Lough.In view of the need to maximise the potential economic benefits associated with this developing technology, the Ocean Energy Development Unit's advisory group is working to achieve a maximum level of co-ordination between the various state bodies involved in the objectives of the ocean energy programme.  The development and implementation of a new offshore renewable energy planning regime is also a key priority both for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and myself.

The ESOP was an element of the Cost and Competitiveness Review (CCR) agreed between the Government and ESB Management and ESB Group of Unions in 1996.  Under the CCR, 5% of the shares in ESB were made available to employees, without actual cash transfer from the employees in return for specific, substantial, verifiable, future changes to be delivered.  The 2001 Electricity Act, which allowed ESB to create capital stock for ESOP purposes, provided the legislative basis for the ESB ESOP.The terms of the ESB ESOP are in line with Government policy and Revenue rules on Employee Share Ownership Plans, which also applies to ESOPs in other semi-state companies including, for example, Bord Gáis.Eligibility for participation in the ESOP is a matter for the ESB Board and the ESB Group of Unions and is established in accordance with the terms of the ESB ESOP trust deeds, the terms of which meet the requirements of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.As required under Revenue rules, the ESB ESOP was open to all employees of the ESB Group (ESB or any wholly owned Irish resident subsidiary company of ESB), provided those employees had completed 12 months continuous service with the ESB Group on relevant dates from 6 April 1997 to 31 December 2002. Former employees of the ESB Group who were in service on 1 January 1998 and who met the qualifying criteria but had ceased employment with the ESB Group at the time the ESB ESOP was established were also eligible to participate.Employees who participated in the ESOP but have subsequently retired or left the Group may still be participating in the scheme but are required to sell their shares on the third anniversary of the later of, the date of leaving the Group or the date of appropriation of those shares. The appropriation of the shares has yet to take place and is a matter for the ESOP trust.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1273	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1083 and 1084 together.There is a range of renewable energy support measures in place, including a number that may prove particularly suitable to farmers or those living in rural areas.In the first instance, there are measures in place to support the generation of electricity on a micro scale as I announced earlier in the year.  These measures include a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour of electricity produced.  This competitive feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 micro-generation installations countrywide over the next three years.  Access to the feed-in tariff will also include the provision of a smart-meter to facilitate exports to the grid and encourage those customers to examine their electricity use generally.  Eligible installations include small scale wind, photovoltaic, hydro and micro combined heat and power.  While there is an upper limit on the size of eligible units, this type of technology would still prove worthwhile for farmers, if only for their own residences.The initiation of a pilot trial by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) of micro and small-scale generation technologies is designed to investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with the deployment of micro-generation technologies including installation, network connection and operation, and generation.  Grant aid for up to 50 pilot installations, will be provided as part of the programme. The experience gained in the performance of this programme will inform the roll-out of any subsequent wider micro-scale programme. SEI has completed the selection process for those pilot installations, and is in the process of issuing the first phase of payments.Opportunities also exist in the areas of Biomass production and Anaerobic Digestion (AD). Leaving aside the market development effects of programmes like Greener Homes and the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (Reheat), both of which have acted to stimulate the market for biomass, a number of other capital support programmes are also in place. SEI's Combined Heat and Power (CHP) grants programme launched in August 2006, assists the deployment of small-scale fossil-fired and biomass CHP systems in industrial, commercial, service and public sectors, and the new Biomass CHP Programme, launched in January 2008, provides grant aid for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion (AD) CHP.  Anaerobic Digestion, in particular, offers a real opportunity for farmers to use animal waste to generate electricity, while also reducing the environmental impact of that waste when spread on the land.  Refit tariffs have also been announced for biomass and AD CHP.The allocation for the Biomass/AD CHP programme was €2m in 2008 and €2.74m in 2009, with €2m spent in 2008.  To date, just over €1m has been paid out on Biomass CHP projects. There have been no funds formally committed for capital investment on AD projects to date, however 5 capital projects are currently under evaluation, to a total grant level of €2.35m. A total of €95,000 has been committed for AD feasibility studies, and €32,200 has been paid.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1286	The performance of and the interpretation of the results of a TB test is governed by Council Directive 64/432 EEC.  The programme for the eradication of Bovine TB in Ireland is conducted under the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and general provisions) Order 1989.  Both sets of legislation provide for the use of the intradermal tuberculin comparative test, known as the TB skin test, as the test to determine that an animal is infected with tuberculosis. This test, routinely used in the Bovine TB eradication programme in Ireland, is the most accurate diagnostic tool available. The Department veterinary inspector interprets the test result and determines if an animal is ultimately a tuberculin test reactor. Nevertheless, in circumstances where the result of a TB test is queried, my Department undertakes an investigation to ascertain that the test was in fact conducted correctly and that the reactions in the animal(s) conform to the normal response to the injection of tuberculin. Where nothing to substantiate the questions raised in relation to the test result is detected, the result remains unchanged. There are currently no plans in place to amend this legislation to allow farmers to introduce a formal appeal process in relation to disputed tuberculosis test results.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1288	The application under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme submitted by the person named included a commonage parcel. However, as the claims submitted by applicants in respect of this commonage under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme exceed the area of the commonage that is eligible for payment, payments to all applicants concerned, including the person named, have been withheld, pending a resolution of the issue. Given that the parties concerned have not yet reached agreement with regard to the commonage parcel in question, it has been decided, as an exceptional measure, to process each of the applications for payment, less the area of the over-claimed commonage parcel declared by each applicant. Should agreement subsequently be reached between the parties as to their share of the commonage parcel, supplementary payments will issue, where appropriate.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1289	Under Article 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Bovine Tuberculosis Order 1989, an animal cannot be moved out of a restricted herd into a premises on which it is intended to be slaughtered unless at the time of its entry it is accompanied by a movement permit. Movement permits are issued at the discretion of a Veterinary Inspector or an Authorised Officer. The current arrangements are such that these permits cannot be authorised electronically.  I should point out, however, that the permits can be posted out to herd-owners.  The Department is at present examining the practicalities involved in issuing movement permits electronically, taking account of legal considerations, including verification of permits.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1290	On 15 July, the Government approved my plan for a reorganisation of my Department's Local Office Network. The plan involves reducing, from 57 to 16, the number of offices from which the Department will operate District Veterinary, Forestry and Agricultural Environment and Structures support services in the future. This will result in a reduction of some 400 in the number of staff working in my Department. While this will yield significant savings for the exchequer, no staff will be made redundant.As part of the process, the Ennis District Veterinary Office including the Agricultural Environment and Structures Office and the Forest Service Office will be vacated and all services will be provided for the counties Clare and Limerick from a regional centre in Limerick.The Department is currently in discussion with other departments in relation to the redeployment of staff and transfer of buildings.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1292	A consultation document entitled "Managing Access to the Irish Lobster Fishery" was launched in 2008. The document was the outcome of a lengthy engagement with industry through the Lobster Species Advisory Group and the Seafood Strategy Implementation Group. The focus of the document was on managing access as the essential cornerstone of a management plan for a sustainable lobster fishery. A 12-week consultation period was undertaken with all stakeholders. 70 written submissions were received. Following this, the Department and BIM engaged in further consultation with the Lobster Species Advisory Group and amendments have been made to the consultation document as a result of this further round of consultation. Detailed discussions are now underway regarding the implementation of the arrangements.The "Managing Access to the Irish Lobster Fishery" document is concerned with putting in place an agreed national framework which provides for management of local lobster fisheries at local level. Matters such as a "closed season" for lobsters would be a matter to be agreed by the Local Advisory Committee in the first instance and then submitted to the national Lobster Species Advisory Group.

To date €720.00 has been paid in respect of nine of the animals.  Following contact with the Suckler Welfare Section of my Department, and the issue of letters on 8 June 2009 and 20 July 2009, the query regarding the provision of amended weaning dates has now been resolved.  Payment for the four remaining animals will issue shortly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1294	I am aware of reports, from the UK, that manures containing traces of the herbicide had allegedly led to damage of sensitive vegetable crops in 2008.  In the UK, such use of manures from treated forage was in contradiction of warnings on the product label that were part of the conditions of use that form the basis of the approval for the product.The product was approved  here in accordance with S.I. No 83 of 2003, as amended, which implements EU Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market.  It was approved for use as a herbicide in Ireland in August 2007 for the control of certain perennial weeds in established grassland.In Ireland, a plant protection product may only be placed on the Irish market when the label fully complies with the conditions attached to the approval of the product.  The content of the label is determined during a detailed assessment of the effectiveness and safety profile of the product from a human health, animal health or an environmental point of view.  All users of plant protection products are legally required to carefully read the label and to use the product only as instructed on the label.My Department monitors the use of all plant protection products on an ongoing basis and may revoke or amend product approvals as appropriate.  In the case of the herbicide mentioned, I am satisfied that, when this product is used in accordance with label instructions, it can be a very useful tool in the control of weeds (including noxious weeds) without any negative consequences for man, animals or for the environment.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1295	The person named established 24.47 provisional entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme at a unit value of €8.62. In order to activate Single Payment entitlements, an applicant was obliged to lodge a Single Payment application in 2005.  The person named did not submit an application under the 2005 Single payment Scheme and, consequently, these entitlements reverted to the National Reserve. My Department's Agriculture Appeals Committee upheld this decision on 3 October 2006.The person named subsequently appealed the decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office and an oral hearing was held on 15 December 2008, at which the person named undertook to furnish my Department with medical evidence in support of his claim for Force Majeure in 2005. The medical evidence subsequently furnished to my Department on 21 August 2009 was deemed to confirm the claim of the person named for Force Majeure, on foot of which the 2005 application form, submitted by the person named to my Department on 26 August 2009, was accepted. However, as the person named had not included a map of the land declared on the application, a letter, requesting an appropriate map, issued on 28 August 2009. The person named lodged the map in question with my Department on 11 September 2009. This map is now being digitised, following which, the 2005 application can then be further processed.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1302	An application was received on 8 May 2008 requesting the transfer of 9.15 Single Payment entitlements to the person named from his late father by way of inheritance under the 2008 scheme year.The normal testamentary documentation was requested and subsequently received. However as the person named was not the holder of a herd-number it was not possible to complete the requested transfer.Upon review it is noted that the herd-number held by his late father has recently been transferred to the person named and backdated to 2 May 2007. In light of this, the 2008 application to transfer entitlements will now be processed under the 2008 scheme year. This will allow the outstanding payment for 2008 to issue to the person named.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1309	The Seafood Development Measure contained in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is divided between the EU Co-funded Operational Programme and the National Seafood Development Operational Programme. The EU Co-funded OP has already commenced and has funded the 2008 decommissioning scheme which has allowed 46 boats to be decommissioned with grant aid totalling €36.6 million already paid over 2008 and 2009.The National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 was advertised for public consultation in October 2008. Following this consultation process  issues were raised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of CFB (Central Fisheries Board) regarding the grant-aiding of projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.This Department with its agencies working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government developed a plan to deliver compliance with the EU Birds and Habitat Directives for wild fisheries and aquaculture over a determined timeframe.  This plan was submitted to DG Environment for consideration.A meeting between this Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agencies and DG Environment took place in Brussels on 13 May 2009 to discuss the plan with a view to securing DG Environment's support for the approach set down in the plan.DG Environment advised that it was, in principle, favourably disposed towards Ireland's plan subject to a positive response to the issues raised and further clarifications from the Irish authorities on the details of the plan.  Additional material has now been forwarded to DG Environment where it is being examined.   When these matters have been satisfactorily addressed, DG Environment expects to be in a position to formally respond on the plan at an early date.A meeting at Ministerial level was held in June between my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Minister Killeen advised on the significant progress made in relation to managing sea lice levels on salmon farms and the concerns of the Fishery Boards were also set down.   I am hopeful that there is a better understanding of the issues involved from both Department's perspectives and that on this basis we can find a satisfactory resolution to the concerns raised.It is noteworthy that the delay in the launch of the National Seafood Development OP has not held up grant aiding aquaculture developments in 2009 as the European Commission has agreed to the continuation of grant aid under the 2000-06 OP until 30 June 2009. A provision of €5m has been made for aquaculture development in the Agriculture Vote for 2009 and I have approved the spending of €4.327 million on aquaculture projects in both the BMW and S&E regions under the 2000-06 OP which will assist the continued operation of aquaculture projects in these areas and the employment that they support.  These projects have been fully completed and payments made.

The legislation will amend and consolidate previous legislation in the domain of animal health, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals and will update existing legislation, to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The proposed legislation will also provide for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals within my Department.Following the public consultation process initiated on the draft Bill, almost 400 submissions/comments were received from organisations and individuals with an interest in animal health and welfare matters. Officials met with a large number of these organisations and individuals to provide an opportunity for elaboration on the respective submissions. Work is now continuing on drafting the Bill taking account of the further observations received.

Shipments of cattle to Northern Ireland are over 53,000 head, an increase of some 230%. Total live cattle exports to the UK, at almost 58,400 head, are 248% up on the same period in 2008. The main reasons for this increase are reduced cattle availability in the UK and higher returns on the market there.Bord Bia continues to work closely with the industry in monitoring and developing emerging opportunities for Irish livestock in the United Kingdom, the Continent and international markets. This includes contact with leading retailers in Britain to establish their interest in cattle born in Ireland and finished in Britain.

The main conditions are that students must be first-time  undergraduates, hold EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right and have been  ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five  years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.Students with official refugee status in the State, and their family members,  who have three years residency in the State (from official date of lodgement of  application for refugee status) may also be considered for free fees once the  student meets the other criteria of the Free Fees Initiative. The assessment of  eligibility under the Free Fees Initiative in individual cases is a matter for  each institution to determine within the terms of the scheme.It is the students own nationality or his/her immigration status in the State  that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement  outlined in the Free Fees scheme. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law  Reform adjudicates on a person's entitlement to remain in the State. My  Department understands that permission to remain in the state can be awarded to categories of applicants other than those specified in my Department's free  fees scheme. In the case of the student referred to by the Deputy, I understand  that whilst the student concerned has been provided with a permission to remain  in the country, he does not meet the nationality requirement of the scheme.Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees initiative  such students must pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third  level institution. Such institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, the  level of fees to be charged in such cases is a matter for the institutions.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1321	The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement for public servants over 50 years  of age was announced in the Budget in April this year and does not apply to  teachers.The intention behind the scheme is that those that retire would not be replaced  thus enabling cost savings to be achieved. The moratorium arrangements within  the education sector provide that teachers can be replaced in the normal way  and that teacher numbers be capped at the aggregate overall number of posts in  place in schools in September 2009. The Deputy appears to be referring to the  redeployment arrangements at primary school level. Teachers on redeployment  panels are redeployed to other schools with vacancies in accordance with agreed  arrangements. While awaiting redeployment they are required to cover short-term absences in their existing school.The Early Retirement Scheme is aimed at civil and public servants who retire  before the age of 60 and whose superannuation options are limited to receiving  their entitlements at preserved pension age or, for people aged over 50, immediate payment of pension benefits subject to an actuarial reduction. It is  not being applied to sectors who have fast accrual of service (eg An Garda  Síochána, Prison Officers and the Army) or for those who have other preferential pension benefits such as the 55/35 year rule for teachers. Under the 55/35 year rule a teacher, other than a new entrant appointed after 1 April 2004, who has reached the age of 55 years and has at least 35 years of actual pensionable service, may retire voluntarily. There is no actuarial reduction in benefits and credit for certain pre-service training is given in order to assist teachers to reach the 35-year threshold for retirement.

I understand that the NCSE has not received any application from schools in the area in question to establish a special language class.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact the SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational  needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their  attention and reply.

The appeal was refused and the school has been notified in this regard. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways  depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which  any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation  processes. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor  for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September 2008.The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional  information on the Department's website about teacher allocations for 2009/10  school year. This was done as a first step at improving the level of  information in the public domain about changes to the staffing allocations at  both primary and post-primary level.The allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial  allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a  number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are  developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position  as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable  redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all  schools will therefore not be known until later in the autumn. At that stage  the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom  teachers and I remain committed to publishing updated information.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer of Co. Sligo has advised that pupils from the  Coolaney area do not reside in the catchment area referred to in the details  supplied and therefore may only apply for catchment boundary transport subject  to the terms outlined above.My Department has commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, which is to be completed before the end of this year.The Steering Committee will look at the original objectives of the scheme,  whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives  are being achieved and whether there are possibilities for economies or  efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this  context, the review will also look at fundamental issues such as catchment  boundaries.The review, when completed, will be published and sent to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.

This is another step in expanding opportunities and broadening access to further education so that people can enhance their employment skills.The number of approved PLC places must have regard to the continuing  requirement to plan and control numbers and to manage expenditure within the  context of overall educational policy and provision.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1328	The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of  pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes. Combined  classes are a feature of the majority of schools in the country and this  arrangement has no adverse implications for the quality of the education  children receive.In terms of class sizes 80% of primary pupils were in classes of less than 30  pupils during the last school year. With over 20,000 individual classes spread  across all schools throughout the country there will inevitably be differences  in individual class sizes. Some schools can have class sizes of greater than 28  but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching  resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes.Where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of  having smaller multi-grade classes as against having particularly large  differences in class sizes at different levels in the school. In general, the  view of my Department is that, where combined classes are formed, mixed-ability  classes are preferable and my Department recommends random selection as a fair and educationally sound approach to the assignment of pupils to such classes.It is open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain  criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was originally established to  adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria for appeal of mainstream staffing are contained in the  staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009 which is available on my Department's  website.The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is  final.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1329	Information on the teacher allocations to second level schools including Chanel College, whether enrolment related or otherwise, are currently available on my Department's website.Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil  enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is  required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved  teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range  of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in  the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.I have always accepted and acknowledged that the decision in the Budget last  October to increase the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools  will have an impact on teacher numbers, class sizes and subject choices in our  post-primary schools from the commencement of the 2009/10 school year.At the level of individual schools, the changes in relation to the allocation  of teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on whether enrolment  is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers  than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. I undertook to publish  information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and this was  done during the summer months.This information identifies the changed position for second level schools and  VECs arising from the October budget decisions. The information represents the  position at the time of publication and is not the final position. At this point, allocations for posts such as special needs, language support and enrolment increases are still in progress as enrolments are being confirmed by schools. The information will be further updated later in the year when final allocations are determined and the final position regarding supernumerary posts remaining in schools emerges.

As part of this process, a proposed project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the Education Partners.  Details are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.Projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation  Programme on the basis of priority of need and as they are ready to proceed.   This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.It is the intention of my Department to provide the school to which the Deputy refers with a new building. In this regard, agreement has been reached to provide the new building on a V.E.C. owned site.The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project in question, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  In this regard, the position with all applications for large scale capital funding is also available on my Department's website.In the meantime, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that, over the  Summer months, my Department replaced all of the existing accommodation at the school to which he refers and it is now operating from its new accommodation since the beginning of the new school year.

In order to prepare for tender and to comply with the new form of Government contract, the project was required to submit a new Stage 2b (detailed design).Following the receipt and clearance of the Stage 2b submission, the project was authorised to go tender in June and a tender report was received by the Department in late August.  The Department wrote to the school in early  September with its comments on the Tender Report and has requested that a revised Tender Report be submitted.When the revised Tender Report is received and assessed the project will be considered for progression to the next stage i.e. the award stage.

The application has been assessed and assigned a band rating of 3.4.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.A further application was received for 2 mainstream classrooms and 1 language support room.  My Department approved a devolved grant for 2 mainstream classrooms for the purchase of prefabs or the building of the additional accommodation required.The Board of Management decided to build a permanent structure and in April  2009 School Planning and Building Unit issued 70% of the Departments liability for that project as the works had commenced.

The cost to construct the two schools was approximately €5m.Due to commercial sensitivities, it is my Department's policy not to reveal financial details of recent construction contracts, such as the contract placed earlier this year for the construction of Phase 2 of the school referred to by the Deputy.  Phase 2 of the project, which consists of a further 8 classrooms, a General Purpose hall, a Special Needs Unit and other ancillary accommodation, is due to be completed by the end of next month.Similarly, I am not in a position to reveal the estimated cost for the post-primary school planned for the site in question.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1334	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1145 to 1148, inclusive, together.When a school applies for a capital grant for a major building project, such as a new school or a significant extension, its accommodation needs are assessed by my Department by reference to the school's long term projected enrolment and staffing.Additional school accommodation may also be sanctioned to allow for the replacement of old prefabricated units, to free up ancillary accommodation such as GP rooms etc that are being used on a temporary basis to accommodate additional teachers and pupils, to provide for pupils with special needs and to ensure that schools have adequate accommodation to implement the primary school curriculum.In 2008, in the areas identified by my Department as most urgently in need of accommodation for additional Junior Infant streams, the "Rapid Delivery" programme constructed new 8 or 16 classroom schools in time to allow the increased numbers to be accommodated in permanent accommodation from the outset.  These new schools were planned and built both to provide immediate capacity and to provide for future needs.  As expected, these schools are filling up incrementally and will continue to do so over the next few years until the school is full.  My Department is currently reviewing all these areas to assess if and when these new schools require to be extended to ensure capacity continues to meet demand into the future.Details of the number of primary schools by county approved for devolved funding for the provision of additional classroom/resource rooms are given in the following tabular statement.  The detail regarding the PAS refers to the approvals given in 2007.  There were no new calls for PAS applications in 2008 or 2009.Statistics recently released by the Central Statistics Office show that the number of births recorded in the State in 2008 was in excess of 75,000, the highest annual number of births since 1896.  As the birth rate rises and remains high, the need to provide additional primary school accommodation will continue.My Department does not ask schools to provide information on the use of each individual classroom on an annual basis.  Indeed, schools will in many cases only be deciding now how classrooms will be used as developing area posts and other resources such as English language support teachers and any additional teaching resources for children with special educational needs are finalised.I am sure that all available space in schools is put to good use by school management and teachers.CountyNo. of SchoolsCarlow3Cavan6Clare1Co.

This is a major capital project. My Departments devolved grant schemes are intended to address smaller projects.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under my Department's capital budget.The proposed building project for this school will continue to be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years.

The Department has recently received the legal documents in question from the VEC and has instructed the CSSO to progress the matter. In light of current and competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

Officials from the Department have carried out a technical inspection of the various site options identified by South Dublin County Council and will revert to the local authority regarding its preferred option shortly.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1339	As required under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs  (EPSEN) Act, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provided a report making recommendations regarding the implementation of the Act which suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to €235m per annum across the education and health sectors.  Having considered the NCSE report, and consulted with the education partners, the Department of Health and  Children and the HSE, my Department identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN.  It is not possible to give exact figures regarding cost as the specific amount of money required to support implementation would depend on the options chosen and the timeframe for the implementation of these options.  However, my Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with full implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged.  However, the Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.I want to reiterate that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs.  The NCSE will continue to  support schools, parents and children, and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools in line with my Department's policies.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1341	The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments to the Student Support  Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second  Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.The Bill makes provision for the transfer of responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector. In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this point when new administrative arrangements can be put in place and I am anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period.Therefore, I am endeavouring to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date, while further exploring the options for administrative streamlining in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform, Transforming Public Services.This will require further amendments to the Bill and my Department has been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in that regard.  Subject to any technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, I hope to be in a position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently in order to progress to Committee Stage in the autumn session.

This report sets out the various options available which looks at available models and draws on experience with other systems that operate internationally.  The report is intended to allow for an informed examination of the issue — including existing international experience, the revenue impact of potential approaches, costs, affordability, value for money for the taxpayer, associated implementation issues and policy issues that arise in the Irish context.  I do not intend publishing the report in advance of Government consideration of the matter.

Due to the impact of the current difficulties on employers generally, the data on average industrial earnings became available significantly later in 2009 than in previous years.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1347	The assessment of means under my Department's student maintenance grant schemes is based on gross income from all sources. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions.The income thresholds are also stated on a gross income basis — the average industrial wage by reference to which the thresholds are calculated represents gross pay before any deductions for income tax or PRSI.I have no plans at present to depart from the above practice in respect of the determination of income.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1348	The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) referred to by the Deputy is a full-time second chance education initiative designed specifically for unemployed persons over 21 years of age.  Its primary target groups are the longer-term unemployed, the low-skilled and the disadvantaged.My Department provides funding for other full-time and part-time learning opportunities for adults.  These include the Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme which is a full time option for learners who have completed their Leaving Certificate or adults who wish to return to education.  The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) is a part-time option targeted at adults with less than upper second level qualifications who wish to combine a return to learning with family, work or other responsibilities.  There are also a wide range of other courses available under the Adult Literacy and Community Education schemes.  Learners who wish to participate in any further or adult education programme should contact their local VEC.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1349	The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement has been made available to staff in the higher education sector. Full details of how the scheme would apply in the higher education sector were issued in July last to bodies in the sector. The closing date for applications under the scheme has since been extended to Friday 16th October 2009.  Accordingly, any employees who are 50 years of age by 16th October 2009 are now eligible to apply under this extension provided they fulfil the other criteria outlined in the scheme.As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the moratorium arrangements is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer. In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure.  Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions. In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight of both my Department and the Department of Finance.  This framework allows flexibility around recruitment into posts that are considered essential to maintaining core teaching and research activities, subject to an overall ceiling on numbers employed.  The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy.  The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1350	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1165 and 1201 together.The Deputies will be aware that the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers, including myself, met representatives of the religious congregations on 4th and 24th June last.At the meeting on 4th June, the Taoiseach conveyed the views of the Government and this House, that further substantial contributions are required by way of reparation and that these contributions need to be capable of being assessed by the public for their significance by reference to the full resources available to the congregations and in the context of the costs of well over a billion euro incurred by the State.At the subsequent meeting on 24th June, the congregations reported on the progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial positions. The Taoiseach indicated that the Government would appoint a panel of three independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.Two representatives of religious congregations, at their request, met officials of the Taoiseach's Department and mine on 7 July to discuss the structure of the statement of resources required.  The officials indicated that these should be comprehensive as to all categories of assets and liabilities and, in the case of properties, should specify the basis of valuation.The appointment of the three person panel by the Government to examine these statements was announced on 28th July.  The members of the Panel are (Chair) Mr. Frank Daly, former Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners; Ms Catherine Treacy, Chief Executive of the Property Registration Authority; and Mr. John Donnelly, former Chairman of Deloitte and Touche, Chartered Accountants.  All of the congregations have submitted their statements.  I understand that the Panel is well advanced in its work and expects to be in a position to report before the end of October.In its statement announcing the membership of the Panel, the Government indicated that while the Panel is carrying out its work, it expected that the congregations would be working to produce an offer of a substantial contribution by way of reparation for the suffering of children in residential institutions.  The statement was circulated to the leaders of all the congregations and their attention was specifically drawn to this aspect of it.

When employed these staff will undergo the normal work shadowing, induction and assignment to a complement of schools.It is intended that NEPS will assess the effect of the assignment of these new staff, in the context of national coverage, at the end of the first term of 2008/09, at which time an up-to–date county by county breakdown will be forwarded to the Deputy. I attach for the Deputies information a copy of that breakdown for the previous academic year.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1354	I should explain that one of the main objects of the School Transport Scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  Bus Éireann is responsible for the day to day operation of school transport services throughout the country.  This is a complex national operation operating during each school year supporting in the region of 75,000 post primary pupils, 52,000 primary and 8,000 special needs pupils.  The majority of pupils are allocated a reserved seat on a dedicated contracted service with approximately 9,000 pupils, generally residing in urban areas and environs, using regular public transport services where these exist.  A separate payment is made by the Department in respect of those pupils travelling on such regular transport services.Given the numbers being transported, it would not be possible without incurring additional expenditure to offer the flexibility to all eligible pupils to travel on the regular public transport services at another time of the day.In relation to the Deputy's reference to school transport costs I can advise that the overall cost of services will be in the region of €194 million for 2009.  This represents a significant increase of over €84 million (over 76%) since 2004, up from €109.8 million.I wish to point out that, despite the escalating costs of the service, charges for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third school term in the 2007/08 school year.  A further increase was put in place at the start of the 2008/09 school year and the new charges come into effect from September 2009.The total contribution of charges from parents in 2009 will still only represent about 8.6% of the overall expenditure for school transport.In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, charge increases have been confined to the eligible post-primary and children availing of concessionary transport. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs will still travel free.  Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card.A maximum family rate of €650 will also be applied.  Parents have also been given the option of spreading the amount due over two payments payable in July and December 2009.While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, given the factors that I have outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a change in the payment arrangements as outlined above.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1358	The Deputy will be aware that the pupils from the area referred to, in the details supplied, reside in a closed school area. Under the terms of the  primary school transport scheme are eligible for transport to the school of  amalgamation. The closed school rule is one of the issues being examined as  part of the School Transport Value for Money Review currently under way and is  due to be completed by the end of 2009.As things stand, the children referred to by the Deputy can apply for  concessionary transport to the school in question. Such concessionary  transport is subject to a number of conditions including the availability of  spare seats on the services on a "first come first served" basis and an annual  charge of €200. Bus Éireann, which operates the School Transport Scheme on  behalf of my Department, has advised that the existing service is operating to  capacity. Parents/guardians of the pupils concerned should continue to liaise  with Bus Éireann regarding the future availability of spare seats.The designation of specific school bus pick-up points is an operational matter  for Bus Éireann and the concerns of the Deputy have been forwarded to Bus  Éireann for their attention. I should say, however, that parents and guardians  also have to play their part in ensuring that children are brought to and  collected safely from relevant pick up points along the route of a service.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Departments website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published  prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the  Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.   Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my  Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an extension project was recently  completed at the second school to which he refers under my Department's  Permanent Accommodation Scheme.  This extension provided 6 additional classrooms and a Special Education Needs Suite.  Funding was also provided for access corridors and for the upgrade of toilet facilities at the school.

It appears that the individual that the Deputy refers to was employed in a post  that was neither funded nor recognised by my Department. Unfortunately  therefore my Department is not in a position to make any statement regarding  the employment in question.

Payment of the annual rental cost is generally made to schools in advance and in two instalments, i.e. January-June and July-December where rental is continuing or up to the expected date of cessation if for a shorter period.It should be noted that it would not be feasible or cost effective to remove  rented prefabricated accommodation for the summer holiday period where that  accommodation would be required to be replaced for the new school year.   Notwithstanding, it is anticipated that the total rental cost for prefabricated  accommodation in Co. Laois will be in the region of €650,000 for the 2009 year.  On this basis, rental for the period 1st July to 31st August 2009 could be  estimated at around €108,000.A review of rental policy is ongoing which, inter alia, is examining contract  terms to incorporate buy out, buy back, rental costs and relocation options if  local circumstances require it. Another strand of the review, which is well  under way, is an investigation of all existing rental contracts between schools  and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs  for the Department.In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of changing market prices.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1365	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The changes  made in relation to book grants were one aspect of these measures.The key change is that aid for school books is being restricted to schools that  have been included within the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools  (DEIS) scheme. By limiting the funding to schools within the DEIS scheme,  savings of €7.5m will be achieved.As the Deputy will be aware, DEIS is the action plan for educational inclusion  and focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people  from disadvantaged communities. Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools at primary and post-primary level for the school book  grant scheme; the same level of provision has been made available for  distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009. At primary level 673  schools will receive enhanced funding, while at second level 203 schools will  benefit.The continuation of this provision to these schools is testament to the  Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and protect the most  vulnerable in our society. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the  schools in most need. This is in line with the broad thrust of the  recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2006 report on Primary Disadvantage.My Department has encouraged schools to implement book rental schemes as a measure to minimise the cost of school books to all parents. As far back as  1993, a report commissioned by my Department dealt with the factors which  contribute to the cost of school text books. The report included useful  suggestions for schools, including a Code of Good Practice for successful  operation of book rental schemes. I know that many schools have developed such rental schemes. It is open to schools to utilise general capitation funding to  fund book rental schemes.  It is my intention to move to a situation where instead of a number of separate grants for different purposes a school will get one grant, giving them total flexibility on how to use it.My Department has issued a circular to schools and Vocational Education  Committees, outlining that funding provided to meet day-to-day running costs  can be used to provide school books where this is a priority for the school or  the VEC.  My Department has sought to ensure that schools are fully aware that  using any funds provided by my Department for such purposes is not only  legitimate but desirable.

All students who  are eligible for a means tested third level student support grant have the  student charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational  Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee  grant to which they are entitled.Under the third level student grant schemes grants may not be paid in respect  of a repeat period of study. I have no plans to depart from this practice.  It should however be noted that the assessing authorities have discretion to  waive this provision in exceptional circumstances — such as for cases of  certified serious illness.

A mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.  Mature students are then categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.The Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate  for different classes of applicants. This power would enable me, if there are  compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider extending the  circumstances where a student could be assessed without reference to parental  income.My Department is currently reviewing the circumstances where a means assessment independent of parental income would be appropriate and in the context of the Programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants and the development of a new unified scheme of student support, is undertaking further consultation on this and related matters with a view to establishing the particular circumstances where assessment as an independent student might be warranted.Any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent student will  have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very  specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been  genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a number of years.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1369	As the Deputy is aware, in September 2008 I instructed that a review of the  procedures for the establishment of new primary schools be undertaken by the  Commission on School Accommodation.  The Technical Working Group established under the Commission to undertake this review commenced its work in December 2008.  It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be complete and revised arrangements will be in place within a two year timeframe of the commencement of the review process.In the interim period and while the review is ongoing, the Forward Planning  Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the  areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for  significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels  over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the  Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of  Social & Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in  years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected  locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics  of those areas. This information has been circulated to all existing school  Patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of  existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new  primary school, should it be required. The requirement for the establishment of  new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and  extend existing schools in those areas.Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis  and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school  accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year  2014/2015.  When the detailed reports are completed for these initial areas identified the Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1370	I should explain that one of the main objects of the School Transport Scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.The overall cost of school transport services will be in the region of €194m  for 2009. This represents a significant increase of over €84m (over 76%) since  2004, up from €109.8m.I wish to point out that, despite the escalating costs of the service, charges  for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third school  term in the 2007/08 school year. A further increase was put in place at the  start of the 2008/09 school year and the new charges come into effect from  September 2009.  The total contribution of charges from parents in 2009 will still only represent about 8.6% of the overall expenditure for school transport.In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, charge  increases have been confined to the eligible post-primary and children availing  of concessionary transport. Eligible children attending primary schools and  children with special needs will still travel free. Charges continue to be  waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in  possession of a valid medical card.  A maximum family rate of €650 will also be applied.Parents have also been given the option of spreading the amount due over two  payments payable in July and December 2009.  While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, given the factors that I have outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a change in the payment arrangements as outlined above.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1375	The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published provisional information on the Department's website about teacher allocations for 2009/10 school year.  This was done as a first step at improving the level of information in the public domain about changes to the staffing allocations at both primary and post-primary level.The allocation process will not reach finality until later this year and I remain committed to publishing updated information.  While the final position won't be clear until all allocations are completed it is envisaged that there will be a reduction in posts at primary level in the 200-300 range compared to last year's allocation.  Allocations are continuing for special needs, language support and developing posts so the precise figure won't be known until these posts are fully allocated and the outcome of any further appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board are known.At post-primary level my Department estimated that the budget changes would result in a reduction of some 1,000 posts but that all of this reduction would not happen in the allocation for this school year.  Apart from the provision of additional posts for some demographic increase and for special needs provision a number of additional factors influence the final net position such as: the level of teacher retirements and resignations in any particular year in general; how retirements are distributed across schools; the extent to which at individual school level the number of retirements contributes to reducing a supernumerary situation in the event that the school is in an over allocation position; the extent to which any redeployment between schools reduces the supernumerary position; the incidence of awards of contracts of indefinite duration to fixed terms teachers; the extent to which a school is able to reduce an over allocation position by terminating fixed term contracts; the number of teachers remaining in individual schools on a supernumerary basis when the allocation and appointment processes have fully executed; the extent to which schools seek and are granted curricular concessions.Taking these factors into account and while the budget measures would ultimately yield 1000 posts the yield in the 2009/10 school year was estimated at about 560.  The estimates for the 2009/10 school year included provision for  320 additional posts (compared to 2008/09) and on that basis the net position was estimated at a reduction of around 240 posts.The allocation of teachers to the end of August 2009 is showing a reduction of 509 posts compared to the position at the end of August 2008.  This indicates that the final net position will be greater than originally estimated.  Allocations are continuing for special needs, language support and for projected enrolments etc. so the final position won't be known until all these posts are fully allocated.The key factors that are contributing to the greater than expected reduction in posts at post-primary level are: retirements in the Secondary and Community and Comprehensive sectors running at over 230 higher than originally envisaged which in schools that are over quota results in the number of supernumerary posts being reduced.  Precise aggregate data on the position in VEC schools is not to hand at present but indications are that a similar higher level of retirement is occurring; the use in individual schools of supernumerary posts against allocations for special needs and language support (circa. 14% of these posts are being filled by the re-allocation of supernumerary staff compared to circa. 7% last year); the number of language support posts is lower than originally anticipated; applications by schools for curricular concessions increased marginally but not to the extent anticipated.

This temporary recognition was subject to the usual rules and procedures applicable to new primary schools.In order to allow my Department's Inspectorate to conclude the assessment process required in respect of all new schools I decided to extend the period of provisional recognition for one year to 31st August 2010.  The relevant school authorities were notified of this decision at the time.  Following completion of the inspection process a final decision on permanent recognition for the school will be reached within this period.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1380	I propose to take questions 1251, 1198, 1251 and 1227 together.The impetus for the introduction of a new entry process for admission to medical schools arose from a recommendation of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education & Training (the Fottrell report).  This report formed the basis for a programme of reform and expansion of medical education and training in Ireland that was approved by the Government in 2006.  A separate Working Group  was subsequently established made up of representatives from the Medical Schools and University Admissions Offices to examine the implementation of revised entry criteria for undergraduate medical programmes, having regard to the Fottrell recommendation that entry to undergraduate medical education programmes should not be exclusively coupled with Leaving Cert performance.  It was ultimately decided that from 2009 entry to the undergraduate medical programme would be based on combination of Leaving Cert results and performance in an independent admissions test (HPAT) designed to measure students' problem solving, understanding and reasoning skills.The weighting given to HPAT is such as to ensure that the test has a meaningful influence on the selection process by assessing skills such as mental ability, reasoning, interpersonal skills and professional attributes which lie outside  of the domains on which the Leaving Certificate is based while at the same time incentivising and rewarding a strong performance in the Leaving Certificate without requiring the achievement of extraordinarily high points levels.Details of the selection criteria and information on the new arrangements were sent out to all post primary schools in late May 2008 by the medical schools. Practice questions for the Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT) test were also made available in May 2008, in preparation for the first test which took place in February 2009 so that candidates could familiarise themselves with the format and nature of the test.  Sample questions were also made available on the HPAT-Ireland website.  No formal preparation is required to sit the test, and the test is designed so that repeated sittings should not result in any significant change to a candidate's mark.Information on the average score achieved by males and females in the HPAT test or the breakdown by gender of entrants to medical school for the 2009/10 academic year is not yet available to my Department.  The gender breakdown of  EU entrants to undergraduate medical programmes in 2008/09 was 181 males and 265 females.  As this is the first year of operation of the new entry mechanism it would be premature to seek to form any firm conclusions in relation to its impact.  I understand that a research group comprising representation from the Council of Deans of Faculties with Medical Schools of Ireland (CDFMSI), admission officers, the Central Applications Office, Irish medical education experts and international advisers has been convened for the purpose of ongoing evaluation of the entry process.  This group will examine the concurrent and predictive validity of the new entry mechanisms as well as the impact on the socio-demographic composition of successful medical school entrants.  The work of this group will inform a review of the new mechanism which will be undertaken within 3 years of its introduction.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned an appropriate band rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Departments website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the relevant local authority or Vocational Education Committee.The student referred to by the Deputy should seek information or clarification directly from the relevant assessing authority.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1387	I propose to take questions 1204 and 1273 together.I wish to reassure the Deputies that I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.The Deputies will be aware that I have met with representatives of both the Church of Ireland Board of Education and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to discuss the funding position of Protestant schools and the background to the decision in the October budget to remove certain grants from fee-charging Protestant schools.I have emphasised that no changes have been made to the block grant, which is expected to be €6.5 million in this school year.  It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.I wish to advise the Deputies also that my officials have met representatives from the Secondary Education Committee to discuss future funding arrangements for Protestant schools.In this context, I have expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools that they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas.As stated by the Deputies, the October Budget implemented changes in how all fee-charging schools are treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated.  With effect from 1 January 2009, teachers in fee-charging schools are allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools.In view of the challenging economic circumstances that we are facing, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.  This decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure.  Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.In relation to the recommendations of the McCarthy Report, I wish to emphasise that these are options for the Government to consider for reducing overall expenditure.  I and my colleagues in Government are considering the various options proposed in the report. No decisions have yet been taken.  I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.

The determination upheld the parental appeal, and the accompanying directive issued to the school requested that they contact the family to arrange enrolment of this child.My Department has remained in contact with the school and the parents since then and on Friday 11th September the school advised my Department that it had written to the family offering a place to this child.  The family has confirmed to my Department that the child started at this post primary school on Monday 14th September.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1391	I am aware of the recent study which applied specially devised test instruments to 37 Irish speaking and 49 English speaking pupils in their first year of second level, with the Irish speaking students having switched to an English medium school after completion of Irish medium schooling at primary level.Fifteen Irish medium and 6 English medium students were also tested at the transition point from second level into their first year of higher education.  For the pupils in first year of second level, Irish medium students performed 8.7% better in the Irish medium test than they did in the same test through the medium of English.  The differences were not significant in relation to the pupils making the transition to higher education.The authors of the study recommend that assessment at such points of transition may need to take place in a student's first language initially to ensure it is appropriate and valid, and that knowledge of the difficulties that Gaelgeoirí may experience with the English mathematics register may help teachers to assist pupils in making the transition.  Standardised tests at primary level in Mathematics are available to schools in both Irish and English.  Second level schools are also strongly encouraged to liaise with the feeder primary school when making decisions based on the abilities and achievements of individual students, rather than relying exclusively on test results.It is important to note that the students transferring from primary level were all in their first year of post primary schooling, and would have considerable further experience through the medium of English before encountering the certificate examinations.  In addition, although the findings are consistent with similar studies in Malawi and New Zealand, the study did not relate to student performance in national examinations, and the sample size was very small.  In the certificate examinations, candidates have the option of sitting their Mathematics examinations through Irish or English, in accordance with the preference on their entry forms.  Bonus marks are awarded for completion of examinations through Irish.  In addition, a student may ask for both the English and Irish versions of the examination paper.The study emphasises the important role of language proficiency in the learning and understanding of mathematics, and the challenges faced by Gaelgeoiri in moving to an English speaking environment.  It was undertaken by researchers in the National Centre of Excellence for Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, in the University of Limerick.  My Department will discuss with the Centre and other relevant agencies how best the issues identified in the study can be addressed.  An Coiste Téarmaíochta, under the auspices of Foras na Gaeilge, has published a range of dictionaries of technical terms.  A dictionary of technical terms in Mathematics is in preparation at present.

Circular 11/95 states that a full school day at primary level comprises a period of not less than five hours and forty minutes.Circular 11/95 and the Rules for National Schools also provide that pupils in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day, (i.e. 5 hours and forty minutes).  It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether this concession should be applied in the case of its school.  If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day, their parents should be notified accordingly and invited to collect them at time of dismissal.It is acknowledged that particular circumstances may arise whereby the implementation of the shorter day for pupils in infant classes may cause issues for some parents.  Where this arises, my Department would encourage school authorities to engage with parents locally with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable resolution.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures.  Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school.  In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.  This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.  The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.I have arranged for the information provided by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their direct reply.

Probation is normally completed after one full school year, but, in any event, must be completed within a period of five school years accumulated service from a teacher's first appointment in a primary school to any post recognised for probationary purposes, whether in a permanent, temporary or substitute capacity.In the case of continuous service, where the professional requirements have been fulfilled, the probationary period terminates on the first anniversary of the date on which the teacher took up his/her first appointment in a post recognised for probationary purposes.  In the case of broken service, where the professional requirements have been fulfilled, the probationary period terminates upon completion of 300 paid days service from the date of first appointment in a primary school to a post recognised for probationary purposes.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1407	My Department fully appreciates the importance of arts and culture to children's education and personal development.  The arts help to promote a child's self esteem and enjoyment of learning.  They also provide an important vehicle for personal enrichment and cultural expression, as well as creating awareness and respect for other cultures.  Working through the arts helps to nurture and develop cognitive, communicative, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social, and spiritual intelligences and skills.  Learning through guided activity and discovery, with children as active agents in their own learning and enrichment, is a vital part of this process.  This is why arts education, through Music, Visual Arts, and Drama, and of course, through language, forms an integral part of the primary curriculum.Schools in DEIS are particularly aware of the importance of the arts in addressing disadvantage, and in promoting success in learning.  Many schools in DEIS use the flexible budgets they receive to promote integrated links with community arts organisations and to offer enrichment programmes in support of the curriculum.  The company to which the Deputy refers is among a number of Theatre and Arts Groups that received funding from my Department over the last ten years to provide performances on relevant topics and drama/arts workshops in disadvantaged schools where the groups are located.  This support was drawn from the Department's educational disadvantage budget which is primarily focussed on assisting schools in their efforts to cater for the specific educational needs of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  With the introduction of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme in 2006, significant additional capitation funding was made and continues to be made available to the 876 schools in DEIS.  DEIS is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available.There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  In light of the current economic downturn the Department's focus is to retain mainstream resources on core interventions in schools.  Support for the Theatre Groups is not consistent with this focus and such spending cannot be regarded as a priority.  While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on the groups, given the extremely challenging economic circumstances, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  As the main focus of Social Inclusion measures is to retain resources in DEIS schools, these schools may at their discretion choose to use some of their additional disadvantaged capitation to avail of the services provided by the Theatre Groups.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1409	The list of every course in every higher education institution that is open to applications under the Labour Market Activisation (LMA) part time undergraduate and postgraduate programme is listed in the following table.  Applications for the 2,500 LMA courses (both undergraduate and postgraduate) are still open in many higher education institutions.  The institutions are in the process of assessing applications and making offers while students are also in the process of making applications and considering offers (students may make multiple applications and therefore receive multiple offers of which only one can be accepted).  Therefore, it is not possible at this point in the process to provide an accurate figure for the number of successful applications.However the total number of applications received to date across the sector has been high and the indications are that all places will be filled.  Final information on applications and acceptances will be available once the approval and acceptances processes are completed in the higher education institutions.  The scope to introduce further labour market activation initiatives in the third level sector is under consideration by my Department and the HEA and in the context of ongoing discussions with other Government Departments on developing appropriate upskilling training and education responses for unemployed people.It should also be noted that in addition to the 2,500 part time places which are being made available on the LMA courses, all full time higher education programmes can also be accessed by unemployed people.  Unemployed people who secure a full-time third level place may be eligible to participate in the Department of Social and Family Affairs Back to Education Allowance Scheme.  Under this scheme, unemployed people in full time education receive a Back to Education allowance which is equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the Job Seekers Allowance.  Recipients also receive a Cost of Education allowance of €500 per annum.  Unemployed people on full-time third level programmes may also be eligible for support under this Department's Student maintenance Grant Scheme.Provision of grants is subject to a means test and other eligibility criteria.  Further information on how to apply for a student maintenance grant is available on the Student Finance website: www.studentfinance.ie.ProgrammesIntake

The application has been assessed and assigned a band rating of 2.2.  I can confirm that a reply has issued directly to the Deputy in relation to the correspondence to which he refers.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1411	Primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the Primary School Transport Scheme.Bus Éireann, which is responsible for the operation of the school transport scheme, on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, resides 0.6 kilometres from the existing pick up point.  Bus Éireann has also advised that two children in another family reside 0.7 kilometres from the existing pick up point.  The families concerned should liaise with their local Bus Éireann office regarding the availability of a payable extension to the current service.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1412	The Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, currently allows for the children or spouse of a former resident to continue with an application to Board where the applicant dies after making the application but before a determination is made by the Board.  There is no provision to allow any other family member, such as parents or siblings, to continue with the application in such circumstances.The primary focus of the Redress Scheme was the provision of financial redress to persons who had suffered abuse while resident in certain institutions.  As with any such scheme,of necessity there must  be restrictions and, while the Government makes an effort to have such schemes as inclusive as possible, this must be balanced with the financial exposure of the taxpayers of the country.  In the case of the Redress Board, the Government, in allowing spouses and children to proceed with the applications was attempting to strike this balance.  In the circumstances, I therefore have no plans to amend the legislation for the purpose referred to by the Deputy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1413	Where a candidate qualifies for a maintenance grant, and is pursuing an approved course to which the Free Fees Initiative applies, the assessing authorities will award a grant in respect of the Student Services Charge.  This grant — of up to €1,500 for 2009/10 — is paid directly to the institution by the assessing authority.  A student approved for grant assistance will receive an award letter from their assessing authority which they should produce to the fees office of their institution.  The institution will then invoice the relevant assessing authority accordingly.  Any student who has already commenced their course and paid their student services charge, who is subsequently approved for grant assistance under the grant scheme, will be reimbursed by their institution to the value of student services charge invoiced to, and paid by, the assessing authority under the relevant grant scheme.The organisation and management of student support scheme grants is a matter for individual Vocational Educational Committees and Local  Authorities.  These bodies seek to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.  It is essential that students return fully completed application forms and all necessary supporting documentation as early as possible to enable decisions to be made with regard to entitlement.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1414	The normal procedure for the recoupment of funding paid by local authorities in respect of first instalment of the maintenance grant is that the Department sends out the recoupment form to local authorities during the first week in November for return to the Department by the third week in November.  The recoupment arrangements are being kept under continuous review particularly in light of the current economic climate, where grant assessing authorities may face additional challenges in terms of financial management.The Department received a representation from Sligo County Council on 24th August 2009 requesting the co-operation of the Department to advance moneys to the local authority in order to facilitate paying eligible students for the first grant instalment of 2009/10.  The Department responded to Sligo County Council on the 31st August forwarding a claim form for the first recoupment of the 2009/10 academic year in order to facilitate the local authority in making an early claim.  Sligo County Council was advised that this early claim would be given high priority once received.  I understand that the claim in respect of the first instalment was subsequently received from Sligo County Council on 11 September, allowing for processing of the claim.The current position in relation to the Student Support Bill is that resources are not currently available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future.  However, I am anxious to progress to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date, while further exploring the options for administrative streamlining in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform, Transforming Public Services.  This will require a number of amendments to the Bill and my Department has been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in that regard.  Subject to any technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, I hope to be in a position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently in order to progress to Committee Stage in the autumn session.

In respect of standard whiteboards and furniture in general existing schools may apply for funding to my Department under the Furniture and Equipment Grant Scheme.My Department is committed to the provision, maintenance and modernisation of physical education and physical activity facilities in our schools for our  children and young people.New curricula are in place for PE in primary schools and at Junior Cert level.  Primary schools received €2000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total  cost of €6.5 million. A similar grant of €4,000 per school, at an overall cost  of around €3 million, issued to post-primary schools in 2007. In addition,  since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to  primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.It is also open to primary schools to use their annual minor works grant to  purchase items of furniture and/or equipment.  Individual primary schools  received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil for the current  school year.

These include:Some social welfare allowances, including the Back to Education Allowance  which had been excluded in the means-testing process, will be included as  reckonable income in assessing eligibility for student grants;The income tax adjustment for farm stock relief will be disregarded in  calculating reckonable income for means-testing purposes;The residency requirement in the State for grant eligibility will be  increased from one year to three out of the past five years for the student — a  move that's in line with provisions already outlined in the Student Support  Bill;The duration of the break in studies required for re-entry as an  independently assessed mature student will be increased from one year to three  years.I announced these changes for the 2010/11 academic year so that students and  their families are notified well in advance.  The new measures will ensure better equity and equality in calculating eligibility to student maintenance grants so that we can continue to target public resources at those who need them most.As in previous years a review of the terms and conditions for the 2010  maintenance grant schemes will be evaluated as part of the annual review  undertaken by my Department.

The inspections focused on the quality of provision, planning and support for EAL students and included evaluation of the teaching and learning of EAL students in both EAL support classes and mainstream classes in the sample of schools. The views of a large sample of pupils and parents were captured through questionnaires.Following the in-school evaluation activity the inspector(s) provided oral  feedback on the outcomes of the evaluation to the principal and teachers, and  also to the board of management in the case of primary schools. Each school was subsequently issued with an individual report setting out the findings and  recommendations relating to EAL provision in the school. A significant number  of the evaluation reports have been published on the Department's website  (www.education.ie). The remaining individual reports will be available on the  website when they have passed through all stages of the publication process.The Inspectorate's Evaluation Support and Research Unit is currently analysing  the data emanating from the various components of this thematic evaluation of  EAL. Emerging trends are in the process of being identified for inclusion in  the Inspectorate's composite reports on the quality of EAL provision which will  be published on the Department's web site in 2010.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1447	The funding arrangements made by my Department for second-level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  With effect from January 2009, the standard per capita grant was increased by €14 per pupil and now amounts to €345 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €8 per pupil in 2009 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €212 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €22 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €557 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €318,500.  The corresponding figure in 2000 was approximately €147,300.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis in line with increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary secondary schools.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.My Department has provided an estimated €18.4 million per annum to voluntary secondary schools in equalisation funding to date.These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.  I will consider how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in the Programme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1462	Given the current trend of increasing student population and the need to ensure maximum benefit from the financial resources available to me, my Department is currently examining a number of broad policy issues relating to school recognition at second level.  This examination will have regard to the objectives of the 1998 Education Act, one of which is to promote the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice while having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources.As the Deputy is aware, in September 2008 I instructed that a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools be undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation. The Technical Working Group established under the Commission to undertake this review commenced its work in December 2008.It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be complete and revised arrangements will be in place within a two year timeframe of the commencement of the review process. In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.In the interim period and while the review is ongoing, the Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the  Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social & Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. This information has been circulated to all existing school Patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school, should it be required. The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1463	The school to which the Deputy refers is among a number of schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification  procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006. The school in question applied for a review at that time but regrettably the school was unsuccessful in qualifying for inclusion in DEIS.This school retained resources both human and financial under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage. When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to this and a number of other schools in similar circumstances, that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.Given the current challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in Budget 2009 in order to contain public sector spending. One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of additional disadvantaged supports from non-DEIS schools from the end of the 2008/2009 school year. From the beginning of this school year these schools will be supported at a level commensurate with all other schools with similar enrolments and levels of disadvantage which had not enjoyed additional supports from other schemes.The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.

In general the advertising costs include expenditure in the following categories: Staff appointments in the education sector; Invitations to attend local hearings; Invitations to forward submissions on education related schemes/projects; Invitations to tender for school building projects.In relation to promotion campaigns, a sum of   € 114,578.31 was spent in 2004 for advice, support and assistance for the "Your Education System" (Y.E.S.).campaign. In 2006 a sum of   €79,238.04 was spent on a promotion campaign entitled "Men as teachers and educators".With regard to the bodies under the aegis of my Department, the expenditure incurred on advertising and promotions is a matter for each agency. This information is not collated centrally by my Department.  If the Deputy has a particular advertising/ promotions campaign in mind in respect of agencies, I would be happy to have my officials obtain the relevant details and communicate them to the Deputy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1465	The Department has introduced a number of devolved grant schemes in recent years with a view to devolving responsibility for the management of the projects to the local school managements. The school management can then make use of its local knowledge and presence on the ground to manage the project more effectively and ensure better value for money for the taxpayer.In this case the Department funded the work on receipt of the necessary certification from the school's architect that the work has been completed to a satisfactory standard. The contract for the works in such cases is between the school authorities and the builder. The Department became aware of some difficulties with the project when it was nearing completion. Since then, officials from the Department have met the school management and have been in ongoing contact with the parties with the express aim of having the project completed satisfactorily in accordance with contract and at best value to the taxpayer. Department officials will continue to work with the school authority if required to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the current situation and the completion of the project.

The first of these was the recommendation that a memorial should be erected and inscribed with an excerpt from An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's apology of May 1999.  My Department is in the process of convening a Committee which will oversee the commissioning and delivery by the OPW (through competition) of the design and building of the memorial.  A dedicated budget will be made available in this regard and my Department will provide secretarial services to the Committee.Education services have and will continue to be made available to former residents and their families through the Education Finance Board.  The Government has also committed to the continuation of tracing services for survivors who may have been separated from family members as a result of having been in an institution during their childhood.In relation to allowing other claims heretofore not accepted, I can advise the Deputy that Section 8 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, currently provides for the Board to consider late applications in exceptional circumstances.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Board is completely independent in the performance of its functions and it is a matter for the Board to decide on the validity of each claim having regard to the legislation.Having said that however, I can tell you that a number of issues have been raised by groups representing survivors.  All of these, including the issue of accepting late applications, are being considered by the Government.

I understand that both FETAC and HETAC are currently consulting with the Trainers Network in relation to its recommendations and are exploring the issues around creating awards at Levels 5, 6 and 7 of the National Framework of Qualifications.

The administrative cost to my Department is minimal having regard to the number of participants in the scheme and the fact that payment to the suppliers and salary deductions are performed electronically.The Cycle to Work Scheme for teachers paid on my Department's payrolls will commence in 2010.  The administrative costs involved in the scheme for teachers will not be known until the number of participants has been fully ascertained.

The programme attracts high-calibre students from US universities to study on a wide cross-section of postgraduate courses at universities on the island of Ireland. Those students are likely to occupy in the future positions of influence in the US.In 2007, a decision was taken to secure the long term viability of this programme by increasing Ireland's contribution to the Fund for the programme by €20 million to be paid over a number of years conditional on matching funding being raised by the US-Ireland Alliance.Following Government approval of the general scheme of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund (Amendment) Bill 2009 I recently sent the bill to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting. The Bill is scheduled to be published in the current session.My Department's funding allocation in respect of the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme will be decided in the context of decisions on the Estimates for 2010 and subsequent years and the matching funding raised by the US-Ireland Alliance.

The data includes the number of teachers and pupils in each school. However it does not contain information on the number of Special Needs Assistants or pupils with special needs in each school. If the Deputy has an enquiry about a particular school my officials will be happy to provide the information directly to him.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to primary and post primary schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. There has been no change in the qualifying criteria governing the allocation of resource and SNA support.The Primary Census for the 2009/2010 school year will be carried out in the Autumn and the final outcome will be made available when this process is completed.Pupil Teacher Ratio in respect of all primary schools is currently only available at national level and is not disaggregated by county or any other variable.

I have been informed that the school reported a fault to the Schools Broadband Service Desk on September 1st.  A call out for repairs was scheduled for September 10th and I understand the service was restored on that date.My Department is currently in the process of re-awarding all school broadband connections under a public procurement tendering process. It is expected that all schools will receive at least an equivalent service to what is currently in place; however the expectation is that the majority of schools will receive an improved service. I look forward to making a further announcement on this as soon as contracts are in place with the successful service providers.
