          <p eId="para_10">I welcome everyone to this morning's meeting. We have received apologies from Deputy Colm Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Members and witnesses attending from within the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of the Parliament due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by Ms Paula O'Connor, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> This morning we will engage with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine the following: the 2021 appropriation accounts 2021 for Vote 34, Housing, Local Government, and Heritage; the Local Government Fund account 2021; and from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021, Chapter 4 - re-allocation of voted funds, Chapter 6 - central government funding of local authorities, and Chapter 7 - the Housing Agency’s revolving acquisition fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> We are joined from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General; Ms Caroline Timmons, assistant secretary, housing affordability, inclusion and homelessness; Mr. David Kelly, principal officer; Mr. Feargal Ó Coigligh, assistant secretary, housing policy, legislation and governance, who was here last week and is again welcome; Mr. Paul Hogan, principal adviser, planning; and Ms Sinead O'Gorman, principal officer. We are also joined by Ms Clare Costello, principal officer, from the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. They are all very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or on silent.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference you may make to other persons in your evidence. As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of presentations they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2023-01-26T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">The 2021 appropriation account for Vote 34, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, records gross expenditure of €5.143 billion. The appropriation account is presented under six programme headings. The largest by value are the housing programme, water services programme and the programme to support local government, which together account for 95% of the gross expenditure under the Vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The surplus of the amount provided over the net amount applied in the year was €392 million. Of this, €276 million related to unspent 2021 capital allocations was carried forward to 2022. Just under €117 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the appropriation account. However, I drew attention to a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgment of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, in November 2019. The case concerned Ireland’s failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The fine imposed by the court comprises a €5 million lump sum payment paid in 2020 plus a daily fine of €15,000 while the infringement continues, plus legal costs. By end 2021, the Department had paid fines totalling €13.2 million and a further liability of €3.5 million had accrued. The daily fine continued to be incurred into 2022. The Accounting Officer will be able to provide an update in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Local Government Fund is managed by the Department and accounted for separately from the Vote. The fund comprises mainly Exchequer funding from Vote 34 and the proceeds of local property tax. In 2021, local property tax receipts into the fund amounted to €550 million. This was up marginally from the level of receipts in 2020. The transfer to the fund from the Vote in 2021 amounted to €699 million. This was down €357 million, or 34% year on year, due to a decline in the cost of the Covid-related commercial rates waiver. The fund expenditure in 2021 amounted to €1.23 billion. At end December 2021, the fund’s reserves stood at just over €159 million. Again, I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the fund account.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Because of the complex ways that central government funds flow to individual local authorities, my office compiles a report each year to present an overview of the level and purposes of the funding provided. In 2021, funding to local authorities from central government sources amounted to a total of €5.77 billion; a decrease of approximately 5% on the €6.08 billion provided in 2020. More than 90% of the central government funding for local authorities came from three sources, namely, Vote 34 - the Local Government Fund and Vote 31 - Transport. Of the total of €5.77 billion central government funding, €2.8 billion was provided to local authorities for housing and regeneration. A further €1.3 billion was provided to local authorities for transport investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The committee previously considered the issue of reallocation of voted funds that was not in compliance with the procedures set out in public financial procedures, as outlined in chapter 4. One of the cases referred to in the chapter relates to Vote 34.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> In summary, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage reallocated €446 million of 2021 voted funds from subheads where there was underspending to facilitate additional spending in other subheads.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Public financial procedures state that the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should always be obtained when a reallocation of voted funds is proposed. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did not have the required prior approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for €314 million of the transfers during 2021. Subsequently, in July 2022, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provided formal sanction for the transfers.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Included in the total reallocated was €310 million to increase the level of Vote funding for the Local Government Fund. This represented an increase of 79% over the Estimate provision amount approved by Dáil Éireann. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines indicate that the better approach to transferring the funding would have been to use the Supplementary Estimate process.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Members will recall from last week that I introduced chapter 7, the Housing Agency's revolving acquisitions fund. The money in the fund originated from Vote 34. In brief, our examination found that, even by the revised target date of the end of 2021, there was a significant shortfall in the delivery of residential units through the fund. The examination also found that at the end of 2021, the cash balance of the acquisitions fund was €37.7 million, representing around half of the total fund value. This is indicative of under-utilisation of the fund's resources.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2023-01-26T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I thank Mr. McCarthy. I call on Mr. Doyle to make his opening statement. It was indicated in the letter of invitation that it is limited to five minutes. We know who is present with him. We want a short summary.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Graham Doyle<recordedTime time="2023-01-26T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">Of course, Chairman. I am pleased to be here to discuss the various areas that you have outlined. You have already introduced my colleagues. We look forward to discussing the expenditure and activity of the Department in 2021 with the committee. I will not go through every area of expenditure across our very broad remit, but I will touch on some key areas briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting, including briefing on the value-for-money Standing Order 218, along with a copy of my opening statement. I will start by welcoming the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the engagement of his team with the Department over the course of the audit. On the basis of recommendations, we will continue to evolve and mature our systems and reporting in line with best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The Department's gross expenditure in 2021, as set out in the Appropriation Account, totalled more than €5.1 billion. This was 2% below the outturn for 2020, due mainly to more targeted Covid-19 support payments to the local government sector in 2021 versus a higher amount in 2020. The year 2020 was a very challenging one for Ireland, and while at the outset of 2021 we were initially optimistic for a return to pre-pandemic activity and expenditure, 2021 in fact was an even more challenging year on many fronts. As we contended with the continued reality of Covid-19, the pace of delivery anticipated at the outset was simply not possible. Construction closures, social distancing measures, workforce impacts and supply chain issues had a significant impact on delivery and consequently on expenditure. However, that did not mean that areas of work stopped. The Department continued to work in delivering emergency legislation, ensuring that vulnerable households were protected, delivering cross-government supports and in preparing the new Housing for All strategy, which was published in September 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Housing for All was launched by the Government in September 2021. It has the objective that every citizen in the State should have access to good quality homes, to purchase or rent at an affordable price and built to a high standard and in the right place and offering good quality of life. This is a whole-of-government plan involving leadership and close collaboration across many Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> In support of Housing for All, the Department's gross voted expenditure on housing programmes was approximately €2.8 billion in 2021, with additional funding available through the local property tax. Social housing represents a large proportion of expenditure under the housing programme, both for existing social homes and adding new social housing stock. New social housing is achieved under the main headings of build, acquisition and leasing. Rental supports under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are also provided. A broad range of services are provided including services for homeless households, supports for older people and people with a disability, Traveller accommodation, energy efficiency retrofits, pyrite and defective concrete block remediation.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> In terms of affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 established the basis for new affordable purchase and cost-rental schemes, which commenced in 2022. Despite the very challenging impact of Covid-19 on construction activity, the second half of 2021 saw some rebound with local authorities, approved housing bodies and other delivery partners seeking to make up lost ground. A total of 9,169 new social homes were provided in 2021, and almost 5,196 of these were new-build homes delivered through local authorities and approved housing bodies. Some 1,262 were targeted acquisitions by local authorities and approved housing bodies and 2,711 homes under leasing programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The challenges of 2021 have given way to further challenges in the construction sector with very high levels of inflation, supply chain issues and in particular, higher interest rates across 2022. However, the Department remains focused on seeking to bring about new supply of social and affordable homes under the ambition set in Housing for All.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Water services continue to undergo a significant period of reform in the approach to the delivery of water services and the promotion of wider environmental protection. Irish Water is now a stand-alone company in public ownership as a regulated utility. The Government's voted Exchequer investment in Uisce Éireann as it is now known, is substantial, and has been growing steadily in recent years, supported now with the revised NDP to bring certainty of investment in the years ahead. Almost €1.3 billion was spent by Uisce Éireann in 2021 to service existing schemes and deliver new water infrastructure and investment. This investment is vital to: maintain and enhance water services; safeguard public health; and ensure compliance by treating wastewater.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> While Uisce Éireann was focused on its capital programme in 2021 and again in 2022, there are significant infrastructure deficits to be addressed. The Government has committed to a high level of investment under the national development plan, NDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> In terms of the rural water programme, in 2021 some €48 million was provided across both capital and current funding structures. Certainty for priority investment has been put in place through a multi-annual capital programme, aimed at improving the reliability and efficiency of rural water services infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> On local government, as chapter 6 shows, transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities totalled some €5.8 billion in 2021. While funding is significantly up since 2016; this was a decrease of 5% from the 2020 level. Again, that was mainly due to changes in the level of Government supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> As the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated, a number of Departments, including our own, and the Department of Transport, provide this funding to local authorities. The Local Government Fund, LGF, is a special Central Fund, which was established under the Local Government Act 1998. The profile of income and expenditure of the Local Government Fund has undergone significant changes in recent years. Income for the fund comes from the Exchequer and local property tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I have outlined some of the main payments so I will skip that in the interests of time. Further areas of expenditure in the 2021 Appropriation Account include: in the planning area, provision for the costs of An Bord Pleanála, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the Office of the Planning Regulator, amounting collectively to €37 million, as well as provision for the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, foreshore and marine spatial planning; Met Éireann costs; and heritage expenditure across a wide range of activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> In conclusion, 2021 and 2022 brought challenges to which the Department and our partners have had to respond. We are very much looking forward to adapting to these challenges, and to strive to achieve ambitious targets in place across our very broad remit this year and into the future. I note the ongoing co-operation by all stakeholders involved in the delivery of a work programme of the scale undertaken by the Department. The Department, its agencies and our partners for delivery, including the non-governmental organisations, NGO, and approved housing bodies, AHB, sectors, continue to focus on achieving the best for citizens. I look forward to engaging with the committee this morning and to providing as much information as possible. We are very happy to come back to the committee to provide anything further that is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I welcome all the witnesses joining us today. It is very much appreciated. I will start by focusing first on previous recommendations made to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Our previous engagement was in June 2022. I will start with the proposition the committee made on improving value for money in expenditure year-on-year on social housing schemes - HAP, RAS, the social housing current expenditure programme, SHCEP, with the focus being on increasing capital expenditure on housing stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I ask Mr. Doyle to provide an update on those recommendations. What has the Department done in response?</p>

          <p eId="para_46">This committee has repeatedly highlighted the level of spend on programmes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. The focus in Housing for All is to provide new social homes through our capital programmes, in particular, to reduce the reliance on those schemes over time. Those schemes have been necessary due to the time needed to ramp up those capital spending programmes, particularly on social housing. That is the main activity we are focused on and Housing for All is focused on that. We brought about a number of ways to keep the pressure on ourselves and our delivery partners to keep delivering new-build social housing in particular to reduce reliance on those schemes over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">There has been a positive response to all of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations. The chief response in that regard has been the establishment of a HAP oversight committee within the Department, which met five times last year and once at the end of the previous year. It examines all aspects of HAP, including value for money, the detailed operation of the scheme, and the processes and procedures under it. There has been some increased desktop checking and oversight of the scheme. We are moving to some on-site checking as well this year so there has been significant focus on it, which the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation has helped bring to bear.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">The concern is that the HAP scheme was introduced back in 2014 to replace the RAS system. However, the level of expenditure for RAS remains relatively current. What measures is the Department taking to move people off HAP and into RAS properties?</p>

          <p eId="para_56">That is often said and it is described in a number of places. RAS was to take people away from rent supplement, paid through the Department of Social Protection. Those who had been on rent supplement for a long period of time moved into RAS properties. HAP is a separate scheme, which is about the support of the rent that tenants pay under that scheme. We have seen a gradual decline in RAS expenditure and we are seeing a slow decline in HAP expenditure as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">For acquisitions, yes. That was mainly to target certain types of housing, either for large families or for specialised housing in some cases. That was to put a significant amount of focus on the build programme. With the challenges last year, particularly in respect of homelessness, and the decision to put a pause on evictions, it was decided to encourage local authorities to purchase properties where there was a risk of a person becoming homeless as a landlord was exiting the market. Sorry, the answer is that number will be significantly higher than 200, ranging from 500 to 700, because a lot of that activity was in December and there is a great deal of conveyancing going on.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I welcome the witnesses. To refer back to the opening statement of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he issued a clear audit opinion for the 2021 accounts but drew attention to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_105">... a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgement [relating to Derrybrien in Galway] of the European Court of Justice in November 2019. The case concerned Ireland’s failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway. </p>
          <p eId="para_106">The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that a lump sum of €5 million was paid in 2020, plus a daily fine of €15,000 and legal costs. At the outset, €15,000 per day is a phenomenal amount of money to be paying. I note the 2022 figures are not included here but I am sure the witnesses have them to hand. To date, how much has been spent on this fine? I ask the witnesses to leave out legal costs for now. We will take that as included. I suspect it is approximately €22 million, or in excess thereof. I ask the witnesses to clarify the position in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">To date, just under €16 million has been paid out. It is €15.98 million. Across the years, between the lump sum, it was €2.7 million in 2020, it was approximately €5.5 million in 2021 and last year it was just under €2.8 million. The judgment essentially required the owner and operator of the wind farm, which is the ESB in this instance, to submit an application for a retrospective environmental impact assessment, EIA, known as a substitute consent, to An Bord Pleanála. It submitted that application. An Bord Pleanála eventually found against it and at that point it ceased operation of the wind farm. Our colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications have engaged with the Commission on this issue, seeking to close the fines that have been paid through our Department. Our understanding is that we are due to receive a decision on that. We are hopeful for a positive decision in terms of it being closed at that point. We expect to receive a decision, which is a matter for the Commission, within a matter of days.</p>

The Committee of Public Accounts will obviously have a role in questioning Uisce Éireann on its operations, but that is not likely to happen until 2024. Why will it take so long?

          <p eId="para_150">I read in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Housing Commission has indicated that Ireland needs somewhere between 42,000 and 62,000 new homes each year, which is wildly out of kilter with the targets set out by the Government and the Department. What are the actual targets?</p>

          <p eId="para_151">The commission has looked at the issue of targets. Its work in that regard is ongoing. There is some mention of that matter in the newspaper this morning. There is a lot of debate about what the targets should be, and we have based them on the work with the ESRI and the housing demand needs assessment. The figure of 33,000 that gets mentioned all of the time is an average. That increases over time. Depending on the assumptions one applies, one can end up with very different targets, so there has been a lot of discussion about those issues. We will need to look at the targets again with the detailed census report and the work that we get back from bodies such as the Housing Commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">The point I am making is that, for several years, members of this committee and others have been saying it is their belief that the housing targets have been understated in terms of what is actually required, and the Department has disputed that.

          <p eId="para_158">My apologies, it was March of last year. We have obviously experienced a very significant migration shock in terms of population since then. Having said that, the under-provision means that the average does get added to as time goes on, so there is a higher figure when we look at an average for the years ahead, and that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Obviously, it has pushed up beyond the 33,000 as a result of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">No set of housing targets could have accounted for that level of shock. That is the first thing. The second thing I am saying is that in the vast majority of local authority areas there is a huge gap to be made up in terms of meeting the target. There is no question of the target being inadequate. The pressure arises in the counties around Dublin and on the eastern seaboard. That is an issue for regional development in Ireland. That regional balance aspect also needs to be factored into the review of any targets.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">Mr. Doyle mentioned density. Our planning policy is for high density, which means that the typologies we get from our planning policy are for apartments or terraced housing. We do not get three-bed semis and we do not get two-bed housing with front and back gardens, which is what people want. Instead, we are spending the taxpayers' money on what they do not want. However, because the developer cannot build them viably, Mr. Doyle spends the taxpayers' money buying them.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Earlier, I heard Mr. Doyle say that some 9,000 units of social housing is being provided. More than 5,000 of them were apartments. Regarding that 5,000, the deferential in money to the taxpayer that would have provided two-bed houses is €1 billion and maybe more. We would have actually gotten more than 6,000 two-bed houses with front and back gardens that will not become ghettos in the future. Would the Secretary General call that value for money?</p>

          <p eId="para_300">They can be very different. It is the enhanced leasing figure I am looking for. I had a number last week that I was wrong about in respect of County Kildare. The number is 681 and I just wanted to correct that.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> When I first raised the enhanced leasing scheme in the Dáil in 2021, the then Taoiseach, Mícheál Martin, told me that no local authority should be on both sides of this and it would be phased out. If anything, I am seeing it being scaled up rather than phased out in my own area. It is incredibly poor value for money. What investors say is that "a further benefit of the leasing option is the investment opportunities for international and domestic private investors". CBRE, which is one of the biggest real estate companies in the world, has recently reported that "investors are keen to acquire residential units and schemes let by local authorities on a long-term lease". Another group now sees social housing as a financial product under the long-term leasing scheme. It is incredibly bad value for money. New houses acquired have to be within a group of 30 or more. They are leased for in the region of 25 years, at up to 95% of the market rent with a four-yearly review. The average per annum figure, according to replies to parliamentary questions is €17,000 per unit, which works out at €425,000 over 25 years. It is then refurbished, returned to the investor and then the housing need has to be met all over again. Essentially, a mortgage is being paid without having an asset at the end of it. That is incredibly bad value for money. The committee is interested in value for money. We need a briefing note on the enhanced leasing scheme.</p>

New build and direct build are two different things. What is happening with the new builds coming in is that they are being bought on a turnkey basis. They are not designed by the local authority. They go through the process as a normal housing planning application. They are approved, built and then the local authority may buy the whole estate or part of it. They are included in the new build numbers. How many were directly built by local authorities or AHBs last year and the year before?</p>

          <p eId="para_312">I want to move on to another issue, which was raised last week relating to approved housing bodies. We were told that the situation is being looked at. There are three tiers to AHBs. Bigger ones tend to be professionally managed while the smaller ones are often managed by volunteers. Typically, the local authority provides the land, the State provides the capital to build and a maintenance amount is allocated to the AHBs of the mortgage. Once the mortgage is redeemed, the ownership reverts to the AHB, so they are in private ownership. AHBs are managed under the Charities Regulator, but they could change from being a charity, or a company limited by guarantee. The Department had stated it was looking at a particular situation, and established an unencumbered units working group. That relates to the approved housing bodies that no longer have a mortgage. Where is that at? What are the terms of reference? How many units are involved in that particular working group?</p>

          <p eId="para_318">There is a real concern here. Another issue raised at last week's meeting, and not for the first time, is that when a local authority builds a house the money is provided by the Department. They build the house. There is differential rent. People pay rent and if the person moves out, somebody else tenants that house. It is up to the local authority to maintain it. With an approved housing body, they get the money from the Department and build the housing. However, we are hearing that some of the AHBs that no longer have a mortgage will allocate the scheme. They will be given a list from the local authority in some cases while, in others, they bypass the local authority, but the local authority will then do a rental accommodation scheme, RAS, with them for the tenancies. The State has built the houses and then it will subsidise the rent even though there is not a mortgage. Where is the value for money in that? Who designed that? Who is the beneficial owner of these houses built by the AHBs after the mortgage?</p>

          <p eId="para_319">Once the AHBs has paid back the loans given by the State, they are then the beneficial owner of the property. They will then use them under their articles of association and under the charities regulation for social housing purposes. In cases where a maintenance payment is paid, it is often to some of those schemes that were for very vulnerable people in the past. The payment is quite low. It is around the maintenance of the property for social housing.</p>

I will draw the officials' attention back to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and Vote 34 in the area of the reallocation of voted funds from 2021. As set out in that report, there was €314 million in 2021 that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not approve for reallocation but the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage moved ahead anyway. It is outlined in the report that the normal way to transfer the funding is to use the Supplementary Estimate process. Why was that not used?</p>

It can either be done through virement or a technical Supplementary Estimate. We need to look at the instance referenced by the Deputy in the context of the substantial savings due to Covid-19. Mr. Doyle outlined that a lot of the capital savings had arisen because of the construction shutdown. In that instance, it was a judgment call between ourselves and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the money could be moved via virement rather than a technical Supplementary Estimate.</p>

We had a long discussion last week of the process whereby we will not own the asset towards the end of the process in respect of AHBs. We also talked about the level of public oversight in AHBs' decision-making. Representatives from the Housing Agency described to us that there will be an AHB group in every local authority. Will the officials very quickly outline what that involves? This group will make decisions around what type of housing AHBs are required to provide.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">I want to get in two questions before my minute runs out. Is it meaningful that we make those decisions around provision? I am particularly interested in the provision of homes for people who have different needs and abilities in respect of disability. Once the mortgage is paid off and there is no lien on the property, what is the mechanism whereby the State will ensure that the AHBs still operate and provide those homes to those particular groups? It does not seem there is any mechanism. I do not see that all that work we will have done on the forum will be meaningful or significant in decision-making in 25 years. That is the first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I have a second question.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">We obviously have a CPO mechanism for derelict and dangerous sites. We have two mechanisms under legislation. There is a move to increase the number of CPOs so that we can utilise our vacant properties and this is to be commended. I am also aware that often local authorities decide it is not cost-effective to bring the CPO properties into social housing and they may in fact put them on the private market. What level of information does the Department have on this? Does it give guidelines to local authorities on what the possible turnaround is? Should local authorities be turning them around at all rather than putting them back in the social system?</p>

Much of the detail the Deputy might be looking for will be in this. We have signalled in Housing for All that we will have a CPO programme for local authorities. In some cases they will CPO for social housing. This is generally when a house is in a particular location that suits for social housing, there is particular demand for it and the service is appropriate. A lot of derelict houses are not in such locations and we also need to see what we can do with them. We are keen to bring them forward. There will be a CPO programme for these houses also and they will be for sale on the private market where appropriate.

          <p eId="para_423">There is a housing strategic policy committee in every local authority. Would it not dawn on anyone to consider this in respect of the approved housing bodies forum? Is the job of that particular committee just to rubber-stamp what is put in front of it? We teased this out last week with the Housing Agency and we are doing so again this morning. I am a former local government representative, as are many committee members. I am taken aback at the amount of serious decision-making that completely bypasses the elected members. I remind the witnesses that the legal council is the elected members. I do not want to personalise this but we have the Department and the county managers who are the chief executives. My last county council meeting was 12 years ago this week. Since that time there has been an amount of bypassing the legal council of the elected members, never mind what I saw during my terms on the council. Here is another example of it. The elected members are the decision-makers on the housing strategic policy committee of the council. Forum after forum is set up with no consideration given to the views of members. Members are not included. However the people who face the music and face the public, as the Deputies here know, are the politicians. It is nearly worse for councillors because they are local. They are the people who answer the questions.</p>

Most of the public hear that in an entirely different way. They hear it as meaning the people they elected to represent them. This is not who we are talking about here. Really it underpins, if anything, that we do not have a local government system. We have a local system of administration where the power really resides. It really does underpin this when "local authorities" is said without differentiating that it is at official level and not at local authority level.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">The Department of Transport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and everybody else are shoving their money to local authorities, and that is good and it is all needed. It is not for this meeting but I can give example after example of local councillors being asked how something happened and whose idea it was when there was a greater need for the money to be spent elsewhere. The local authority members say they do not know and they have no control over it. They say the money came from a Department to the chief executive officer who decided where it would go. That is it. We are undermining the basis of democracy. The most important piece of democracy is local government. It is the closest to the people. We have pulled it asunder in this country. It is a bigger issue but I could not help intervening as Deputy Hourigan was raising these issues. It came to mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I understand that, but it should not be. What we are talking about here is new builds. That is our understanding, according to the briefing notes. We had the Housing Agency here last week. We follow this closely. I do not know whether other members are aware of it but this is the first time I heard it. That figure needs to be taken out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> In relation to delivery, because this is a real crunch issue, I have raised with the Secretary General previously the issue of generic designs. Nobody, whether politician, official, architect, local government official or anyone else, has ever explained this to me. There is no reason we cannot have generic designs for one, two, three and four-bedroom houses, single storey for disabled people and two-storey for family apartments. We used to do this. We know it works because one can see the evidence of it all over the country in decades gone by. As I have told the Secretary General previously, this is not about lowering the standards to those of 1940 or anything like that. It is about building generic houses to the 2023 standards - A-rated houses. Instead of that, every local authority is starting with a blank canvas. One is paying architects' fees. I checked again this week. Architects' fees of between 8% and 12% of the overall cost are going on it. People in the sector believe that it is madness. I believe that it is worse than that. It is slowing down delivery because one has to get approval from the Department, back and forth, for design.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> I raised this and the Secretary General stated that he would look at this and come back to me. Why can we not have generic designs with which we can mass produce houses? I am not talking about low quality. I am not talking about what looks like the Soviet Union in 1940. I am not talking about any of that. I am talking about good-quality housing. I have given the Secretary General examples in the past of good quality housing that his Department approved - A-rated houses. Why can we not take that and replicate it across the country? Who is stopping it? Did the Secretary General raise this with the Minister, or who is stopping this?</p>

          <p eId="para_486">I understand that the Department would have certain specifications. That is different from what I am talking about. What I am talking about is simple and straightforward, that we have a generic design, for instance, for a two-bedroom terrace house, that is most appropriate that can be used in Donegal, Kerry, Offaly or Laois, and that we have single-storey two-bedroom units for people with disabilities that can be used across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> What I am asking the Secretary General is, why have we to go back to a blank canvas on every occasion? It is costing more. It is slowing down the process. Those are the two issues. We are discussing the cost of these projects and the speed at which we can get them delivered. We are in the middle of a crisis. I need not tell Mr. Doyle that. I am sure the officials are doing their best to deal with this. One of the big impediments are these issues and this is something that we can deal with. There is no reason a firm of architects will not design a generic model for us by looking at the best examples of what we have used to date, there are some brilliant examples, that can be replicated right across the State. A little like how, I understand, pop stars get a royalty every time their tune is played somewhere, every time 100 houses to the architects' design are being built in Donegal or wherever, they would get a limited, modest fee or royalty on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">If we were doing large fields of large numbers of social houses - we try to integrate social housing into the community for all kinds of very good reasons and we are committed that - and when these schemes are developed, they need to fit into a certain site profile and they need to fit in with what has been planned for the area. We have made very clear, to try to short-circuit that design process, what is acceptable, what is required, what meets the standards and what we will fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">The quickest way of reducing it is to have a generic design. Can I take Mr. Doyle up on the issue of fitting them in? I get that but it does not have to be huge estates like the ones in the south of the city that were built during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">This can be done. A lot of these are infill developments and a generic model can be used for them. They can also be used on greenfield sites. This can be done; it is not rocket science. It has been done over and over again and with huge success in providing social housing in decades gone by. The one thing that drives me bonkers is that we seem to have every reason we cannot do what worked in the past. If it worked in the past, there is no reason we should not do it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Can I ask Mr. Doyle about PPPs? Can he come back to the committee on this? Can he have a serious chat with those at the top in the Department around what is being proposed and tell me if it can be done, or why it cannot be done? Can we go a step further not just in terms of internal design?</p>

          <p eId="para_498">Our social housing guidelines encourage the use of the generic designs we have. We have not mandated it but the use of generic design is encouraged. What we are now trying to encourage much more of, particularly around the delivery of social housing, is the modern methods of construction such as offsite construction which speeds up delivery and will ultimately in the future bring down the cost. They are two things we are looking at at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">On costs and the PPPs, those first two bundles are coming in at €633,000 per unit. Some of those would be one-, two- and three-bedroom units. They would be small units. That is an absolutely astronomical sum. I know Mr. Doyle will say it is for the full lifespan over 25 years and that there is maintenance. However, from what I have seen, and I have checked, the maintenance in the local authorities works out at between one fifth and one eighth of what comes in in rent. That means the rent more than covers it. The rent is normally five to eight times higher than the actual maintenance costs for the local authority. I am puzzled as to where this figure of €633,000 per unit came from. I checked again yesterday to see the cost for local authorities. The all-in costs - it goes back to Deputy Verona Murphy's point - with site costs, architects fees and all of the other expenses - come to €250,000, or €290,000 for good-sized local authority housing. This figure is two and a half times that. Why is that?</p>

He said earlier we have a viability issue, which means that, clearly, it is not affordable to build the houses, but now it is proposed that on the vacant site that is not being built on we should impose a land tax at a rate of 3% per annum that is not refundable - or, at least, currently not refundable.

          <p eId="para_668">Even though the issue was, as Mr. Doyle said earlier, viability. Logically, then, as the Secretary General looking for an increase of €15,000, Mr. Doyle is telling me that it is correct to impose a tax on such land - we are all saying there is a viability issue - and correct to increase the taxes pertinent to housing development in the middle of the worst housing crisis ever.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">What does the Department do and what does it choose when it comes to looking at value for money in respect of the various housing schemes? How does it select those if it is seeking that value for money? I remember saying in 2014, when HAP was introduced, that it would become unsustainable if there was not a large-scale housing building programme. We are hearing about PPPs that have been evaluated.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">We can see the position with turnkey projects. A 2020 review found that it was 30% more cost efficient to build directly rather than use turnkey projects, so there is a value for money issue at play. There are examples of AHBs whereby leases are being subsidised by way of RAS. We know that apart from the human cost, homelessness is very expensive. There are wider societal and economic issues relating to the under-delivery of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> All of these schemes that involve a short-term element are not permanent solutions. What has the Department done with regard to value for money for each of those schemes? Has it tested them individually? What has it found? What is its methodology?</p>

          <p eId="para_726"> I have a question about the local government fund, something about which I routinely ask, and the review of the baselines and the change in them. The population with regard to the local government fund really dates back about 25 years. That is the basis of how they were originally determined and it has not changed much in that time. The population of the area I represent has doubled in that time but the baseline has not changed and this determines how much local property tax the local authority can spend. You cannot grow a population without growing the services to meet that population increase but that is exactly what has happened. Trying to figure out the local government fund is akin to the third secret of Fatima. I spent several months going through this. If members of the public, particularly those in areas that are growing, really understood this, they would be up in arms because the money is not being spent where it needs to be spent because the system is not population-based. It pays no attention to population. What is happening? I know a political decision was made on this. What information does the Department have? Has it produced reports on how it is be managed in terms of when that change is going to happen because parts of the country are at breaking point in terms of delivery of services that should go with their populations?</p>

          <p eId="para_729">The Deputy is correct. The baseline funding has remained unchanged since 2014-2015. It was not possible to adjust the baselines or undertake the review in advance of the local property tax, LPT, allocations for 2023 due to the delayed census and also to take into account the LPT yield date following revaluation. An examination of the current LPT baseline funding has commenced and is expected to conclude in advance of the LPT decisions to be taken prior to the budgets for 2024. The process will include consultation with the sector and relevant stakeholders. Elected members are the key stakeholders in that regard. Previous reviews and studies of local authority funding will be assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> The Deputy is correct. Undertaking such a review is complex and the circumstances of local authorities vary so significantly in terms of population, population density, service needs, geography, topography, roads and coastlines. They are all-----</p>

My questions are largely for Ms Costello and Mr. Doyle. I want to understand the decision process involving that €314 million. As outlined by the officials so far, the Department felt that this was a moving around of funds that had been saved in another area and it informed that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this was how it was going to proceed and bring it to Cabinet. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had not preapproved that but said the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage could proceed and carry out a virement - I am not an economist so I am not good on that word - but that the next time the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did that, it had to tell the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform beforehand. Is that a fair representation of what happened?</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not having any numerical guideline makes the work of committees incredibly difficult with regard to providing oversight, because there does not seem to be any rules around whether a Department can sidestep committees. If the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is serious about that - this is very big money - is it proposing to rewrite or change the public financial procedures? It is effectively doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">A discussion on approved housing bodies, AHBs, arose last week out of an issue I brought up last week. I have discussed it with Mr. Doyle in the past. I know we are trying to deal with a legacy situation. Nobody in this room has been responsible for the creating the situation. When these small AHBs reach the end of life, what happens to the property? What happens to the tenant? What protections are there? Some of these small AHBs were set up in order to provide 20, 30, 40 or 50 houses. They are a credit to the people who set them up. They were people who worked voluntarily. I am not casting any aspersions on them. However, we are reaching a situation where things are moving on. Some people may be moving on in years and the homes are coming out of the terms of loan. What happens now? What is happening in a particular AHB - I will not name it, but you know the one to which I am referring - is that there are no rent controls, the tenants are being handed forms to claim rent supplement from social welfare and €10,000 in hello money is being charged before one gets in the door. That is ruling people out. These houses were built by the taxpayer for social housing purposes to meet a housing need; in most cases, for the most vulnerable groups, that is, elderly people and people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> People who were tenants of social housing now find themselves dealing with a management company that has been brought in. That is the interface and with whom the tenants are dealing. I brought this to the attention of the agency and the regulator. It is a very welcome move that we have a regulator. The head of the regulator seems to be a formidable woman. I wish her well in her work. However, the houses effectively stop being social housing. You are correct in that there is a bit of time with some of the houses, but some of them are maturing very quickly. They are out of the term of the loan, which means we could wind up with the wild west, for want of a better term. What can we do in the short term? Someone needs to get a grip on this, because I do not have answers for these tenants. Other Deputies and councillors throughout the country do not have answers. This problem will come out all over the place in the coming months and years. What can we do to try to give some level of comfort? The thought of taxpayers paying for rent on a house that they built is absolute madness. The fact there is a possibility that these houses could be moved on without us, the council or anybody else having any control over it, and with hello money being charged, is crazy stuff. The houses were built for vulnerable people and people are being asked for €10,000. What can we do about this in the short term?</p>

          <p eId="para_803">In general terms, we are trying to establish facts. We have already spoken to the regulator with regard to what can be done about that specific incidence, once we establish all the facts around it. Both of the schemes go back a very long period of time. We are trying to establish the facts and work with the regulator. We have spoken about the unencumbered units, the terms of reference of which my colleague has here beside me. We will provide those to the committee. We will work through those issues. What we have seen more often, or what colleagues and the regulator have seen more often, is a situation where some of these AHB properties, in the circumstances you describe where people may be getting on in years and so forth, have been transferred to other AHBs. We insist on that being done at no cost, which is what has happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">That is okay, Mr. Doyle. I do not wish to rush you, but the problem is that a situation has arisen whereby a private management company is already in.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The private management company is now dealing directly with these tenants and handing them the forms to go and claim the rent supplement. That company's officials are the people who are now setting the rent. They are now the people in charge. Can anything be done in the short term? I know one of the principal officers, Mr. Roger Harrington, is dealing with the issue and he did come back to me on it. I ask Mr. Doyle to ensure that a principal officer sits on top of this because it is an escalating problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_808">There are actually a number of principal officers trying to deal with the situation going forward to put in whatever safeguards need to be put in. If those ultimately need to be further legislative safeguards, we can propose those as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> With regard to that specific matter, yes, that specific principal officer who appeared before the committee last week is dealing with that matter to try to establish the facts that go back a long period and work with the regulator. The initial piece now is that the regulation model is a significant change. I think it has helped in the industry significantly and this is exactly the type of thing we have a regulator for at this point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_746">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2023-01-26T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_810">Okay. The allocations do not come through the local authority. They have not even come within the term of the loan. While the loan was maturing and before it was discharged, it was not the usual situation where the allocations came through the local authorities. The assessment of social housing need has to be done by the local authority. We cannot have a situation where people make it up as they go along. The local authorities have the lists of who is eligible in terms of income, housing need, family size, disabilities and the rest of it. We cannot go outside of that and break that model with houses that are built by the taxpayer. We have to get that back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> This is the final thing I will ask of Mr. Doyle. Will he please put it to the Minister to try to come up with a model? None of us will be here in 25 years' time but the people who are sitting here will be facing similar problems. This will be a rolling issue. We must move to an equity model. In other words, instead of the State giving a loan, grant or whatever else under the five different models, which we went through last week so I will not do so again, but which included the different housing and financing programmes for AHBs, we must put in place an equity model. If the State owned 10% of those, this could not happen. The State or the local authority has control of it. It is not about standing on anybody's windpipe or anything like that. When we build something and pay for it, we cannot just take three deep breaths and head off into the wild west. We have to try to manage this in a housing crisis. These are houses for social need. We have to try to make sure that those people who are going into them are those who are most in need and that they have a reasonable way of dealing with the landlord or AHB. One of the pieces of information I ask Mr. Doyle to take back with him is to have a discussion within the Department and also perhaps with the Minister-----</p>

          <p eId="para_813">Mr. Doyle advises the Minister. He needs to advise him of this issue. In fairness to the Minister, he is dealing with a lot. I criticise him often but he has a lot on his plate. He may not be aware of the snowball effect of this. It is the case with a number of these AHBs that the loan has been or will be discharged fairly soon. We are facing a really large problem.</p>

          <from> Mr. Graham Doyle<recordedTime time="2023-01-26T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_814">Three elements of work are under way within the Department at the moment. There is the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, review, which the Minister has been part of and is essentially happy with at this point. We now need to make a proposal to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about changes to the CALF model, which we have worked through and on which we have had stakeholder consultation. The second piece is the unencumbered units and what happens in that regard, which is much of what the Chairman has been talking about. That piece of work is ongoing. The third piece of work is what the Chairman referred to when he spoke about the equity piece, which has been raised by some of the bigger AHBs. We now have to continue a conversation and try to get to a point where we have an approach to this gearing issue. I spoke to representatives of the association and also the alliance that represents the big AHBs last week. This issue of gearing was raised. That is, therefore, another work stream.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">I wish to address the Secretary General's remarks on land hoarding. Everything we have heard today has been the Department blaming everything that is outside of its control from interest rates to inflation and now land banks. The reality is that land hoarding is a false narrative and if it does exist, it is very much in a very small minority of cases. It certainly does not exist in County Wexford and I doubt very much if it exists in the Secretary General's home county of Waterford. It may exist in a small percentage of cases here in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> We need to get to grips with the real issue, which is planning policy. Mr. Doyle has now been Secretary General for three years, in which time he has had much correspondence from me pointing out where planning policy is, in effect, causing problems of viability and all the other issues. Mr. Doyle is well aware that 60% of the planning permissions granted will never commence because of viability, and 70% of those not granted will never commence because of viability. The Department blames all the outside influences, however, and then if planning is to commence, it wastes the taxpayers' money by purchasing property that is essentially driven up by the Department's lack of action.</p>

It is important to note that while there may be more work to be done, a huge amount has been done over the past decade to ensure that what happened in the 2000s and before does not happen again. That has happened at a number of levels. New construction standards came into place in 2013, for example. New building regulations came into place in 2014 that very clearly assign responsibility for each stage of the construction process and the sign-off in that regard. We have supported the local government system in terms of developing a shared service office and national building control office. In other words, a huge amount has already been done to improve standards. Lastly, there was the enactment this year of legislation that will provide for the construction industry-----</p>

          <p eId="para_833">Construction product regulations came into effect in 2013, for example, with regard to construction standards that we use.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, prepared additional national advice and guidance on the EN product standards, namely SR 16 and IS 325. The Department recently introduced specific guidelines on the marketing of concrete blocks which address some of the issues. The Minister asked for the addition of quarries in Donegal. The Department has taken many steps and the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office works with local authorities to ensure those steps are enforced.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">I am not aware that we have. The Deputy might have seen that an issue arose last year in Donegal. The Minister requested an audit that was carried out by the national building control office in association with Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, and Donegal County Council. They found some fault with paperwork and process but the block standards seemed to be fine. That shows the regulations are working.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">Mr. Ó Coigligh outlined some of the legislation. SI 288 of 1949 is Standard Specification (Solid Concrete Building Blocks Made with Natural Aggregate) Order. I will not read it all but the relevant part states:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_865">The sand, i.e. fine aggregate passing a 3/16 in. test sieve, shall not contain more than 10 per cent. passing No. 100 test sieve.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_866">(a) Harmful Impurities.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_867">The aggregate shall not contain harmful material in sufficient quantity to affect adversely the strength or durability of the concrete. Mica, shale or similar laminated materials, or soft particles, shall not be present in such a form or in such quantity as to affect adversely the concrete.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_868">When tested in accordance with the method given in Appendix A the quantity of harmful impurities passing a No. 200 test sieve shall not exceed (i) in the case of fine aggregate 3 per cent. for natural sand and 5 per cent. for crushed stone, and (ii) in the case of coarse aggregate 1 per cent.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">We know "coarse" means there is a lot of stone in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> That is from 1949. It was brought to my attention this week. We have legislation since 1949 and here we are in the year of our Lord 2023 and it seems as though no one was watching this. Who tests the sand? We have been lucky where I live, except for north Offaly. Edenderry was affected by pyrite but so far - touch wood - we have good companies providing good quality products in that part of the midlands. Where are the tests done and who is doing them? We could paper Leinster House with regulations, statutory instruments and legislation but who actually does this?

We know what has happened. There is no need to rehash all of that. We ended up with mica, pyrite and all kinds of problems because of it. I have quoted the 1949 legislation. Who will enforce it?

We now sit here with a bill for €2.5 billion, that is, for 2,500 million euro, because of the hands-off approach. Surely we can stop creating these problems and allowing these problems to arise. We have the legislation and the knowledge. We have more knowledge than they had in 1949. Think of what this country was like in 1949 after the Second World War, recession and so on. In 1949 they were able to solve this. Do you know why they were able to do that? It was because they had a clerk of works and local authorities that kept an eye on things. That was despite the fact that the country was very poor. Here we are now and we cannot seem to do because everything goes in a roundabout way through trails. There cannot be a trail.

We had an audit that the Minister requested in regard to issues that arose in County Donegal again recently. That made some recommendations about the need for further resources to help local authorities to carry out their functions. The audit showed the extent of work that went in, the extent of compliance which showed where there were gaps in the paperwork, and on the back of that the Government has decided to build on the good work that has been done and the good controls that are now in place to bolster that by putting in place a national regulator.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">What I am saying is there have to be samples and the local authority is probably best because it is the closest to it and has engineers. I am saying that the Department must look at this. As I said to Mr. Doyle, we are in a process now where we are setting up this regulatory authority. I am trying to suggest a way whereby we ensure that we do not keep making these problems for ourselves and creating huge bills for the taxpayer. I ask the Department to look at seeing whether there is a way of simplifying that. It has to be done at the concrete plant and what is called the batching plant. It has to be scrutinised by an official with an engineering and scientific background who can state there is no mica in it or that the components in the batch are correct. There is no other way. You have to stop creating this problem at source. When it gets to the site it is too late. It is all over. A load of concrete arrives and rain, hail or snow, that load of concrete has to be poured. If the sky opens it has to be poured. That is the reality. That is how it works on any building site.</p>

It is grand to have all these bodies but we have more quangos than would fill the Phoenix Park. We need a very straight line in regard to the tests being taken at the concrete plant, particularly at the batching plant so that it can officially be stood over and somebody in a public body somewhere can say "Yes" or "No" and if it is not up to standard that they can intervene and stop it.

          <p eId="para_902">One area I brought up previously with the Department at the Committee of Public Accounts is the rural water programme. It is accounted for under the subheading B4 with an expenditure of €48 million in 2021 against an estimated €56.5 million. In regard to the commencement of the review for the 2019 to 2021 multi-annual water programme, has that commenced yet? How advanced is it at present?</p>

          <p eId="para_903">The review is going on at the moment. Having multi-annual funding gives some confidence into the sector and has allowed these plants and the issues around them to be addressed over a period by the local authorities, so it is given that structure. I have a note on it here, I was talking to colleagues in that area last week so my understanding is that the review is now starting.</p>

In my constituency more than 500 households in north Mayo, in Porturlin, Portacloy, Srahataggle and Carrowteige, do not actually have a domestic running water supply. The urgency and importance of measures for consideration in the future multi-annual rural water programme from 2022 to 2025 needs to be expedited. Currently it has not been published.

          <p eId="para_905">I am not sure of the reason for the delay but I absolutely take the point in regard to Mayo. It has the highest proportion, only Galway rivals it in any way, in regard to the number of private group water schemes. In regard to the 2019 to 2022 programme, I believe about 18% of the total funding has been paid through Mayo County Council. The importance in that part of the country is recognised. We have significantly increased the funding overall on this scheme over the past number of years.</p>

Regarding the themes, there are a number of issues to come back to us on, including the breakdown of the costs in respect of the PPPs, or the €633,000 per unit. If the delegates are here again, could they discuss further progress on the generic house designs, in addition to the unencumbered units of AHBs when then they come up with the term of the loan? I know a principal officer is working on that but could the committee be kept briefed on it in general? The regulatory authority is another issue. There are several other issues. The delegates will see them from the transcript. I have just mentioned four of the big ones. The big themes coming up today, along with a range of others, are speed of delivery and value for money. We recognise that there are many challenges. We obviously wish the Department well with them. Hopefully, we can move things along and speed things up.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">City of Dublin Education and Training Board has a big budget – €564 million. Therefore, the amounts we will be talking about are relatively small in terms of overall expenditure. I acknowledge that and certainly do not want to diminish the very good work done. The figure for audiovisual equipment is €240,000, that for cleaning contracts is €259,000, that for learner support is €512,000 and that for school meals is €366,000. These are not the kinds of figures that would normally jump out at me. I realise there is a real issue in terms of the amount provided for school meals and under-provision in terms of the real cost. I would have thought these figures related to the kinds of services you would tender for. They have jumped out at me. I completely understand that if something turns up on a Friday or a school has been broken into, you might have to get security or some such service, but these figures do not seem to fall into that category. It is disappointing to see that.</p>

That is really why you need a specialist, particularly in a very big education and training board like the one in question. One reason the expenditure of City of Dublin Education and Training Board is so high is that Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants are paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">There are actually two businesses in there. From memory, one is approximately €350 million, so by comparison with other education and training boards, ETBs, we are looking at maybe €250 million.</p>

It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. This correspondence was held over so I propose we deal with it today because Deputy Munster is not here.

          <p eId="para_950">On the review referred to in the first sentence, instead of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform trying to convene the various interested parties, the approach that appears to have been adopted looked at individual organisations, units of Government or Departments in isolation. I think that was a test that almost predetermined the outcome. We saw that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, relied on the data sources and collection that Benefacts had done, whereas another State body would never use Benefacts. It was important to look at this collectively rather than individually and that is not what happened. It is useful to see that as a process and understand that this can be a deficiency if something like this happens again. At this stage, we know there is another proposal from the Department of Rural and Community Development. We should request the Department's business case for that and also the proposal for the scope of Pobal. We could usefully ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a copy of the two reports done by Benefacts. It compiled research on behalf of the Department on people working in the non-profit sector regarding pay and pensions. It would be useful to see those. Obviously, in a modern public service, information is important for making good decisions. In fact, if I remember rightly, the point that good quality information delivers or assists with good governance was made in the Indecon report. That is the point I have been trying to make throughout our discussions on this issue. I ask that the committee make those two requests.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">Is that agreed? Agreed. We have raised the issue of a business case regarding the Benefacts decision a number of times and we have not seen one to date.

          <p eId="para_955">Yes, it was an interesting decision. I have not heard the logic for it yet. The committee has discussed the matter many times. We will persevere and seek information in the two areas outlined. We have agreed to note and publish No. R1654B regarding Benefacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> No. R1657B from Ms Eeva Leinonen, president of Maynooth University, is dated 11 January 2023 and provides information requested by the committee regarding a proposed student centre and student levy fund. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. I note the correspondence states that the projected costs were more than 50% of the original contract, which would mean a breach of public procurement rules would be likely. That seems to be the rationale. Deputy Murphy has indicated she wants to speak on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_957">I know something about this issue. It relates to a facility that was to be built for students. A levy was collected for a considerable period and then increased. Students agreed to pay it in return for getting this facility. When the contract was awarded and work had started, it was discovered that the costs exceeded the original contract amount. I do not know how the tender system worked to allow that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">We have been told in this response that members of the governing authority are drawn from the staff, students and graduates and external organisations. I am not sure who the decision maker is in this regard. The students seem to have been blindsided by this decision. I met with them afterwards. We are being told it is the governing authority that has responsibility. Was the governing authority the decision maker in this case? I am not sure. I think students would have known if they were represented on that body and they did not seem to know.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> Further on, it is stated that following a decision by the governing authority to terminate the contract, the university is currently considering the scope for legal redress against certain parties involved in the project with a view to cost recovery. I refer to the contract being already terminated. I presume it is possible when something is terminated to still proceed with cost recovery if it was not within or deviated from the contract. It is difficult to understand this.</p>

The group comprises students and staff. There seems to be some duplication here. Is the governing authority the decision maker? The students are represented on it. I do not understand this process. The real question is what happened to the levy moneys that were specifically collected for this project, which has not been delivered and it certainly does not appear that it is going to be delivered in the short term.</p>

          <p eId="para_963">The levy had a definite purpose. It is being mentioned that little pods will be put in here and there and outside seating and that kind of stuff. The university has grown and there have been some great additions made to it to date. The number of students has increased in recent years from approximately 5,000 to about 15,000 now. Student facilities should be improving as the institution grows. What is a university without students? Catering for their needs is part and parcel of this context. The understanding regarding this levy was that it was being collected for the delivery of a building.</p>

          <p eId="para_971">We will look for that information. We will move on. No. R1658B, from Ms Dee Forbes, director general, RTÉ, dated 11 January 2023, provides information requested by the committee regarding expenditure on a musical production, <i>Toy Show - the Musical</i>. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> Regarding this matter, further correspondence has been received today, dated 11 January 2023. I have not had a chance to read it because I only got it in the last few minutes. Members can take a moment to read it.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> The one thing that became clear from reviewing the correspondence yesterday was that it sets out very little information regarding numbers, data or any information of substance. Commercial sensitivity is cited, but what the committee needs to know is how many shows were originally scheduled and how many went ahead. I understand some were cancelled due to illness. Generally, some shows will have a provision for that, but what provisions did RTÉ have? Were there understudies in place? I am sure the events were insured. RTÉ indicated that many television shows have taken several years to bed in and for the investment to show whether it has been successful. I would like RTÉ to advise the committee if it is considering proceeding with <i>Toy Show - the Musical </i>in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> RTÉ has indicated that it has tried to balance its response with the committee's legitimate interest in understanding the rationale for the project. From what we have seen in this response, the organisation has failed to do that. It has provided little or no information of note in terms of what we need to know in respect of this committee's task. RTÉ states in its letter that its remit covers more than commercial activity and that the organisation has a balance to strike in respect of providing clarifications. While it is good to receive this information back from RTÉ, I do not think it tells us anything and does not answer any of the questions we had. I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p>

          <p eId="para_977">I originally raised this issue when the show was being advertised and I do not think that it had commenced so it was not in the time when there were difficulties with illness or things like that. RTÉ repeatedly told us in its letter how cash strapped it was and said, "We must try new things, to grow and sustain all we are obliged to do." I have no problem with innovation and trying new things. However, I would expect that there would be some degree of a cost-benefit analysis beforehand and I am not sure if that has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> RTÉ has a specific remit. On the last page of the letter, it states that RTÉ "will of course conclude a much more detailed analysis of Toy Show the Musical in due course. As would by typical of musicals of this scale and ambition, our aim is to bring the show back over a number of years to recoup our investment.” So it does appear the intention is to repeat the musical. It would be useful to see if RTÉ will conduct a review in advance. I am sure that venues must be booked a long time in advance but it would be useful to see the review. I think that it would be quite useful to ask RTÉ if it has included the cost of promoting the musical in its cost-benefit analysis. I ask because the event was heavily promoted and there may be opportune costs in terms of where they slot that in when it comes to other advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> I shall outline one of the things that has been brought to my attention. With live shows there is always a risk and sometimes they do not work out as people would like because people can get sick and we know that this winter has been particularly difficult. RTÉ needs to learn a few lessons such as telling people well in advance if there is a risk that a show may not happen. I say that because people were in their seats awaiting the musical to begin having bought all their stuff in the shop beforehand and it was only then they were advised the show would not start. I know ten people who spent €500 in the shop and then took their seats but then everyone was advised that the show was not going to start so all of their popcorn and everything else was added to the cost. There were people, for example, who had booked hotel rooms and made travel arrangements, etc. Many people were disappointed when the show was cancelled. All of that must be factored into the associated risks. RTÉ should demonstrate fair play by telling people about the risks well in advance and I hope that it has learned its lesson.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> The committee should seek the review that has been mentioned. I have no problem with RTÉ being innovative, trying different things and trying to earn cash in different ways but I want to know was a cost-benefit analysis ever considered. We are likely to have RTÉ in again this year and it would be useful for us to see the review as part of its profile. </p>

          <p eId="para_981">The Deputy has asked a number of questions. First, if RTÉ is proceeding with another musical will it conduct a review first? RTÉ has indicated that so it looks like RTÉ will proceed and we must get it confirmed whether a review will be carried out. The Deputy raised the issue of giving notice of cancellations and asked a very legitimate question. She asked how many shows were originally scheduled for last Christmas, how many shows went ahead, was there a loss and has a cost-benefit analysis been carried out. Her questions capture all that we need know and I thank the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_982">I respect anyone's right to raise any issues here at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. I am thinking of the scale of the task ahead of us. Commercial semi-State organisations must make commercial calculations so inevitably with such a remit there will be losses as well as successes. Let us consider the scale of public spending in the HSE, for example, which is more than €20 billion. I think that we could have multiple meetings of this committee on that budget line alone. I wonder whether investigating what happened with the show is the best use of our time. I think that Deputy Verona Murphy is right. The context of this discussion should be when RTÉ seeks public funding in the context of a licence fee and so on. I hope that I am not wrong about this but I am not sure that RTÉ is directly responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_987">The context is that RTÉ is faced with substantial financial challenges thus leading to a number of questions. This committee has had RTÉ in here a number of times as there has been a number of issues that we have been concerned about. Both the work that this committee has done and some of its recommendations have been useful. Of course we, as a committee, have encouraged RTÉ to broaden its commercial activity and increase the amount of commercial funding coming in. All that is true but context is everything. RTÉ, as the public sector broadcaster, has an important role and, by and large, it has fulfilled that role fairly well. In terms of context, we must ensure that the State broadcaster is on sound financial footing. RTÉ has gone through a rocky period and we want to make sure that it is coming out of that space. The Deputy is right that we should not tie up our days and nights with this stuff. However, I believe that we would be negligent if we did not keep an eye on RTÉ and I thank the Deputy for pointing out that. We will seek clarification on the points raised and I hope that will give us further information.</p>

          <p eId="para_996">I am just wondering. We are being told that this is going to be one of the projects and that it will be closely looked at for learning lessons from other similar projects. Some will be lessons about how not to go about a tendering process. Largely it will be about that, but it would be quite useful to know if there are similar projects in other jurisdictions so we could see how that kind of thing worked and the kinds of safeguards that could be done on a phased basis rather than waiting until one gets to the very end. A lot of the delays on this, for example, were at the beginning of the contract. This is what delayed on the delivery to achieve the 2022 completion of the hospital. I do not know where we would look for similar projects in comparable jurisdictions, or whether the Department has looked for that. I believe this could be a benefit when we come to look at the overall review of this. If we are ever going to learn the lessons we have to know how other jurisdictions handle projects of this nature and not make the same mistakes again.</p>

          <p eId="para_997">The correspondence we have here sets out that in December €1.2 billion had been spent.

At each level there would be a budgeting for the year. It seems to me that the obvious question to ask, in the first instance, is what is the provision for 2023, and to ask the HSE if that is within their own budget. Then if they believe that the allocation in the budget is likely to be insufficient, due to inflation or whatever, the committee can ask where they are going to find the rest of what is required this year. It could end up requiring a Supplementary Estimate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1019">There is a difference between a claim that is signalled.

A verified claim is a different thing. It comes much later in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">I believe there could be more than €600 million in claims signalled. This is really big beef. We are talking about big money if it is in addition to the figures we have here. We can ask the HSE the question next week. We will ask the secretariat to note this and request information from them. We will ask what the budget is and if it will be sufficient, particularly in light of the pending claims, some of which we hope would be settled this year. Some of these might end up in the High Court. We can tease that out with them. It must at least be signalled for discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> On the completion date, there was a date of March 2024. We must ask the board about the nine-month period for fitting out and for activation. It would be useful to find out from the board if they are still tied to that figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> Another question that I am not clear about is on the moratorium on claims. At what point does that stop? I do not know the answer to that and perhaps we could find this out from the board. Are members happy enough with that? We will note and publish the item of correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> I shall now move on to correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. The following items are related. We agreed to hold them over until a response was received from the Charities Regulator. This has to do with the provision or otherwise of abortion services. The correspondence is: R1574 C, from Deputy Neasa Hourigan, dated 11 November 2022; R1577 C, from former member of the committeem Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, now Minister of State, dated 15 November 2022; and R1601 C from Deputy Carthy dated 24 November 2022. Last week I proposed that we would deal with these as they have been held over for a while. The items concern the alleged operation of a body as a charity that is not registered as such. I understand the same matter was raised at a meeting of the previous Committee of Public Accounts in November 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> I ask that Members keep in mind the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable. </p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> The Charities Regulator confirms an application for registration has been received from the body in question. It is a long time coming but that is what the confirmation is. There is useful information in the correspondence regarding how the registration process works and it is also stated that this can be protracted in certain situations. I am proposing to note the item. I do not believe it is appropriate to publish this correspondence because the body is referenced. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> Would any member wish to come in to discuss this? Is the committee happy enough? One of the items of correspondence was from Deputy Hourigan. Does the Deputy wish to comment?</p>

What we have here is a report on the transcript from a number of individuals, including Deputy Hourigan herself. I do not have the benefit of actually seeing the transcript. I suggest we ask the Charities Regulator why in this case it took so long - over three years - and if this is accurate. I do not know whether it is or not but the chair of the Revenue Commissioners, Niall Cody, was very strong on this matter and matters needing to be legal or if matters were legal or illegal. In view of that, we should look for clarification from the Charities Regulator rather than waiting for it to come in later.</p>

          <p eId="para_1043">That concludes our consideration of correspondence. The next item of business is our work programme. At our meeting on 19 January, we agreed our work programme for January and February. We want to continue the practice of trying to plan at least six or seven weeks out to give everybody, the witnesses and the secretariat, a chance to get their ducks lined up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> Next week, we will engage with the HSE to resume examination of its 2021 financial statements, with a focus on expenditure on disability services, including the provision of disability services by outside agencies, which are generally section 38 and 39 organisations; emergency care; and measures to tackle waiting lists. At our meeting last week, we agreed to include GP services, in particular out-of-hours services, and funding of voluntary disability services agencies on the agenda. Members may recall I mentioned at the last meeting that I have been told there are six different models for providing that out-of-hours service. The Taoiseach confirmed the other day that it is a bit <i>ad hoc</i>. I do not want to misquote him but he seemed to indicate it is very fragmented. I remind members that we agreed to defer consideration of the business of the committee for 2 February 2023 to facilitate attendance by members when the President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, will be addressing a joint sitting of the Dáil and the Seanad. </p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> On 9 February, we will engage with the Department of Health regarding its 2021 appropriation account as well as chapter 12 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2021 on the financial impact of the cyberattack. We have advised the Department that a specific area of interest is expenditure on emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> On 16 February, we will resume our engagement with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with a specific focus on direct provision expenditure, international protection and emergency accommodation. Members have billions there to get their teeth into, in case Deputy McAuliffe thinks we are dealing with small change here. His point was well made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> On 23 February, we are planning to engage with the Central Bank and to request representatives from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Finance.

          <p eId="para_1054">Yes. I have one more suggestion. Given the work we did on greyhounds and the current discussion around Coillte, and as we cannot have Coillte in, it might be an idea to invite the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">Okay. I suggest that given the scale of things and what is playing out at the moment, we would deal with the issue of forestry first.</p>

          <p eId="para_1061">I noted this somewhere on one of the hundreds of pieces of paper around the place. The Deputy is correct that it is something that needs to be looked at. It is agreed that we have the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in regarding forestry in the first instance? Agreed. The other issue is to add the Charities Regulator to the list. If members agree, I suggest we prioritise forestry over the Charities Regulator. That issue is very important but I think that is what we should do, given what is happening at the moment and the concern across the Dáil and the Parliament over that issue. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
