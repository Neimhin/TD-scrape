#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following urgent matter: the Government's various views on the Hanly report in order that the people can learn why Ministers are making opposing statements on its recommendations and to allow the Taoiseach the opportunity to display some leadership, given the rebellious nature of some of the comments made, particularly by the Minister for Defence, the Apostle Peter of the Government. If the Minister denies the Government three times—

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 31 and therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 4, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2003 – Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 24, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 – Second Stage (Resumed).
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	11	There are no proposals to be put to the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I have raised on a number of occasions the effective workings of the Dáil. Legislation exists which requires that all matters relevant to European Union directives and regulations be referred to the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny. This did not happen in regard to the proposal for funding for embryo research. When this matter was brought to the attention of the House, the sub-committee referred it to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Members of all shades of opinion on that committee unanimously recommended that Ireland would not support funding for embryo research within the European Union. I understand that the Tánaiste indicated this morning that the Government will be supporting this, without her having had the opportunity to return to the committee to debate the matter or without the House having had the opportunity to discuss it in a general sense.It is a contemptuous way to treat the members of the committee and the House that a Government statement should be made on the national airwaves without a matter being discussed in the House, the national forum of the representatives of the people. It is here that this kind of decision should be made. I respectfully suggest that the Tánaiste should not have carried on her business in the way she did earlier this morning. She should, as she said she would, have returned to the committee, explained her position and taken cognisance of the unanimous decision of its members in making a recommendation to the Government that Ireland should not support funding for embryonic research.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I do not know if Deputy Kenny heard what I said this morning, but he asked the Taoiseach about this issue yesterday on Question Time. The Taoiseach made it clear, as he has on a number of occasions recently, that the Government was voting for controls and regulations. Under European Union law, money can go to embryonic stem cell research. That was adopted when the Sixth Framework Document for research was agreed and there is a moratorium on spending that money until we have regulations. The moratorium runs out at the end of this year. The Government has been asked to vote in favour of or against regulations, control and guidelines.I very much look forward to going back to the committee. I made that clear last week and the week before and I am more than open to doing so. The European Parliament will also deliberate on this matter next week. I have given a commitment to the Deputy, as did the Taoiseach yesterday, to appear before the relevant committee to discuss the issues that arise on this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Tánaiste is going to the committee to outline her position. The committee has made a strong and unanimous recommendation and I expected that she would have gone to the committee before she made a public announcement in the national media.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	15	She should follow the example of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I seek your indulgence, Sir, to permit me to refer to exchanges that took place in the House yesterday between the Minister for Transport and myself. During those exchanges I referred interrogatively to the Minister in a manner of words which has a construction capable of being put on it that I did not intend. I want to make clear that, whereas I believe the question of a second terminal at Dublin Airport is dictating the decision on Aer Rianta, I did not intend the construction that is being put on the words I used and I want to take this opportunity to withdraw that.Is it the intention of the Government or the Minister for Transport, as reported in today's newspapers, to introduce legislation later this month to enable the break up of Aer Rianta, given that discussion has only now commenced on the complexities of the issues involved and given that negotiations have only commenced with the trade unions? Having regard to the wide-ranging implications of the issues, including the matter raised by Deputy Connaughton earlier, does the Minister intend to bring the legislation before the House as early as the end of this month?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I understand the discussions under way, which are to end by 5 December, do not relate to policy issues and decisions that have been made by the Government and it is the Minister's intention to bring legislation before the Government shortly, with a view to its publication before Christmas. I do not know whether it will be November or December but the Minister's intention is to publish the legislation before Christmas.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	19	On 24 December.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	20	What was reported in the newspapers this morning presumably did not appear out of the blue. Somebody said legislation would be brought before the House before the end of this month. That is manifestly not the case.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I cannot be definite as to whether it will be before the end of November or before we break for Christmas. There is a number of weeks.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	22	If the legislation is not approved by Cabinet, how can it be introduced before the end of this month?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	26	When can the Minister for Defence and I expect legislation arising from the recommendations in the Hanly report? Will that affect legislation such as the medical practitioners Bill and the nurses and midwives Bill? Will the recommendations give rise to new legislation or will they be addressed in the current legislative programme?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That question was dealt with earlier this week.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I cannot give a timeframe for the legislation. However, the Hanly report will be debated again next week and I understand it does not have any legislative implications.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Who will be in charge next week?

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Deputy has made his point.

Will the Tánaiste confirm that time will be made available next week for a debate on the Estimates? When will that be and will it take a full day?Could the Tánaiste arrange for Naas hospital to be excluded from the Hanly report, similar to Nenagh hospital?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I refer to the forestry (amendment) Bill and the Estimates debate. Which Minister has responsibility for forestry? Will it be the Minister for the Agriculture and Food or the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	43	That does not arise on the Order of Business.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	52	There is legislation.

There are 48 EU directives outstanding across a range of Departments but, according to the legislative programme, only three are accounted for and none of the relevant Bills is due until next year.

As the Deputy will be aware, not all of them require legislation – they are implemented by way of secondary legislation. A whole host of directives will, I believe, be transposed by the end of this year. By the start of our Presidency, we hope to have substantially reduced the number of directives outstanding, some for technical reasons and others for other reasons to do with difficulties in their transposition in this country. A new team of people has been recruited and made available to Ministers to help with the technicalities and legalities of transposing those directives.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	142	When the debate adjourned I was talking about the number of companies in our economy which are not only not prepared to allow trade union representation but which take a vigorous and sometimes vicious attitude in preventing workers from obtaining professional representation. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, will be aware of the ongoing dispute at the Oxigen waste management company, which has to be addressed as soon as possible because it presents a grave threat to industrial peace in the country. Oxigen has a recycling and waste management contract with Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and other local authorities in the Dublin region and those are vital functions for the city and other areas where the company operates. It is also a vital part of the overall waste management plan which has been rolled out by the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister should be aware that workers seeking the simple facility enjoyed by Members and staff of the House – professional representation regarding conditions and rates of pay – should not have that denied them. Senior workers should not have to walk up and down outside the gates of the Oxigen factory in Clonshaugh to demand this basic right.I welcomed the Bill last night because sections 8 and 9 seek to begin the process of outlawing the victimisation of workers who seek professional representation. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, said that the code of practice on victimisation in the workplace is being prepared at present by the social partners. There is a sense of urgency about this and, following the passage of the Bill in coming weeks, the kind of blatant victimisation of people attempting to become members of SIPTU which has gone on in Oxigen will be outlawed. The perpetrators of that crime should be dealt with severely under this law. Yesterday the Minister of State stressed the voluntary nature of industrial relations and the Minister knows from her landmark long spell in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that I have tried to contribute to this debate. I have tried to have Article 40.6.1º of the Constitution vindicated. That Article guarantees to all citizens the right to form associations and unions and that is why I said that attempts by Oxigen and others to prevent trade union representation is frankly unconstitutional. This issue should be pursued on these and other grounds.The Minister will remember the debates we had in 1998 and 1999 when I was Labour Party spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, particularly regarding my Trade Union Recognition Bill. A key point the Minister made at the time was that she was afraid to come forward with the full report of the high level group, to accept my Bill or to look at the situation which had evolved in England. Under Tony Blair's leadership of the British Labour Party mechanisms could be created in the workplace which would trigger when a number of workers wanted professional representation by a trade union. Mechanisms could be put in place which would trigger the availability of a full trade union representational structure for a company. Although we still have not reached that point, I welcome what the Minister did in 2000 with the code of practice, which arose from a previous Bill, and which has now been extended here. As I said, these seem like baby steps towards the desired outcome, which is the right of every citizen to professional representation in the workplace.Deputy Stagg, the Labour Party Whip, referred earlier to the Ceann Comhairle's role on the Committee on Procedure and Privilege. We have the facility of calling on the Ceann Comhairle to represent us on key issues affecting our work and conditions. Most of those working in this House are fortunate that there are skilled professional trade union officials who can help them and most people would feel those officials have done a very good job in the benchmarking debate and related issues in recent years. The idea is that those in the workplace, such as the employees of Oxigen, should be entitled, as a basic civil right, to meet in the canteen after work with the shop steward; I often did that in my earlier career. The entitlement to meet to discuss work conditions or the future prospects of one's company seems basic.One of the arguments the Minister put forward in 1998-99 was that we could not upset the Americans in particular. Many high-tech companies were coming to Ireland, particularly from Silicon Valley in San José, which had a culture of not having trade unions and which had all kinds of other devices for representation.I am disappointed the Tánaiste has had to leave the Chamber. During the past almost seven years it seems that the greatest factor affecting my region on the north side is American companies deciding not to locate here or existing companies deciding to leave. Many high-tech companies have fled industrial estates on the north side to relocate in places such as Bangalore in India and Singapore. In recent weeks, one of our major companies decamped to China.One of the key reasons for such developments is our lack of competitiveness, for which the Tánaiste has a grave responsibility, particularly in terms of insurance costs. It is astonishing the Government parties have been in office for almost seven years, yet we are still only getting to a point, which one of the Tánaiste's predecessors in office had reached, on the monitoring of the insurance industry and on dealing with problems that created grave issues in regard to insurance costs. That lack of competitiveness, for which the Tánaiste has direct responsibility, is a serious issue.The argument that seems to be espoused at times by the IDA and others, that we could not have full trade union recognition because of the impact that would have on inward investment, can be effectively rejected. I was proud a few years ago to stand with workers in the north inner city when they sought to be represented by MANDATE trade union. However, it is astonishing that distinguished companies from, say, Germany, which has trade union recognition and a strong tradition of socio-economic involvement and social partnership, come here and insist on non-recognition of trade unions and perhaps on conditions and pay rates which are out of kilter with the traditions of our labour market. It is critical that in areas where major multiples are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as is the case on the north side, there is trade union recognition.In the year that I brought forward the Labour Party's trade union recognition Bill there was a major campaign by SIPTU to achieve trade union recognition for some of the lower, if not the lowest, paid workers of Ryanair. During the past six or seven years a vicious and vindictive campaign against the trade union movement has been carried out by Michael O'Leary and Ryanair, which has sought to portray trade unions and professional representatives of staff in a completely ludicrous light and which four or five years ago almost precipitated a major crisis at the airport.This Bill offers some small steps towards the ideal of full trade union recognition, for which the Labour Party sought to legislate in the past and will seek to do likewise in the future.

Even though people in Donegal might believe this Bill is too little too late, we are moving in the right direction.Donegal has seen a number of job losses over recent years. A task force on employment was drawn together by our capable county manager, Michael McCloone, in conjunction with the Tánaiste's Department. While the report and its contents in that regard were welcomed at the time, it would take more than €0.50 million to implement it. Unfortunately it is still gathering dust in county council offices in Lifford, with the result that Donegal has the highest level of unemployment nationally, more than twice the national average.Since January some 1,200 jobs in member companies of IBEC have been lost in Donegal and some 80% of all redundancies in the north-west have been in Donegal. While I may be straying slightly from the Bill, the unemployment crisis in Donegal must be raised at every opportunity in the House to help bring it to an end. I appeal to the Tánaiste to focus more of her attention on unemployment in Donegal. We have enough reports, it is now time for action and the necessary resources to be put in place to end this crisis.Inishowen is one of the areas worst affected by unemployment in County Donegal. I highlight the difficulties facing the remaining workers in the renowned Fruit of the Loom factory in Buncrana. As far as I am aware, the code of practice that was in place in this plant has been scrapped by management and the workers there are operating in an extremely difficult environment. I am not sure what the Minister can do, but I request her to use her good offices to help to resolve this dispute. If she cannot intervene, her advice and direction in this case would be much appreciated.I apologise for not sticking precisely to the Bill, but exceptions must be made for Donegal, given the unemployment crisis there.

I appreciate that the Department has many wide-ranging functions that can keep everyone occupied, but given that it has as it departmental head the Tánaiste and also two Ministers of State, it should properly recognises the contribution this House can make to legislation put before it by the Department and have a representative from the Department overseeing this debate. I express disappointment that no member of the Department is present in the Chamber.In responding to this legislation yesterday my party colleague and spokesman on this area, Deputy Eamon Ryan, expressed disappointment that the process which accompanied this Bill, its genesis and the quick proceedings that brought it to this House, were influenced by the degree to which the social partnership works more for some within the social partnership process than for others. I can speak from personal experience in that before I was elected to this House I participated in social partnership as a member of the National Economic and Social Council representing the community and voluntary pillar. While I found the experience I gained in the three years I was a member of the council extremely valuable, it was clear that there were different classes of membership in terms of the social partnership process. Some partners were more equal than others and the most senior and most equal of the partners are undoubtedly the employers pillar and the unions pillar. This legislation is borne out that recognition.This Bill is welcome in its own right. It provides for small but necessary steps in areas where reform is required. However, it is unfortunate that legislation is necessary for what should be basic and definable constitutional rights, as speakers have said. There is a contrast in the speed with which this Bill came to the House. Although it has already missed a deadline, having been promised in Sustaining Progress for early 2003, it still has come to the House within a relatively short period of time. Legislation that would have far greater importance for the community and voluntary sector in the partnership process is the charities Bill. We are still waiting for that legislation, 25 years after it was promised in the Costello report. It is interesting to see how the Government prioritises its legislation programme with the slight, but important, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2003, yet important legislation such as the charities Bill is still not brought before the House.I am dissatisfied with how this House deals with the partnership negotiation process. Sustaining Progress was never discussed in this Chamber, although it has been discussed in the Upper House. All participants – the ICTU, IBEC and the community and voluntary pillar – in the social partnership process have processes in which to endorse partnership agreements. It is not just for Sustaining Progress but all other agreements before. However, this House has none. It should be a basic requirement of the social partnership process that a debate and a vote in this House must accompany any agreements. That this is not the case, is not only a slight to this House but further demeans those of us on this side who are not participants in the everyday business of government. On these grounds, I want to see a more proactive approach from the Government.This Bill is inching along in terms of legislative reform in areas that should be taken for granted. The principle of freedom of association is enshrined in our Constitution, yet the idea of people choosing to be part of a trade union is in question with many employers. Other forms of victimisation can and do exist. I had experience in my employment career where membership of a political party was put as a question mark at a particular time.  While this Bill does not deal with those specific areas, I can let the Department know there are many areas that are in need of greater reform if we are to be serious about dealing with victimisation in the workplace.Those supportive of the trade union movement must remember that there is a need for better legislation and considerable reform in this area. They should also be aware that freedom of association carries with it the individual's right to disassociate. If industrial relations are to be based on the right of the individual worker, it is not only the right of people to choose to join a union, it is also the right to remain in or leave a union. It is also their right to have different unions operating in an individual industry or company. There is still the potential for a great deal of industrial unrest. This is not only due to how employers are dealing with current legislation. It is also due to practices in the trade union movement that make it difficult for individual workers to choose not to be a member of a union or create another one in their particular company or industry.The social partnership process has been successful in generating a better era of industrial peace. It can be seen in the number of days lost to strikes, decreasing dramatically from 1987, with the first partnership agreement. However, in the last two years this figure has started to creep upwards again. This is a worry for the House, the Government and, in particular, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. I am not certain that this trend can be reversed through the introduction of Bills such as this. Why is a degree of industrial unrest beginning to simmer again in many companies? It has been alluded to by previous speakers that some of it is caused by economic uncertainty. This comes from the idea of industries that can relocate at a moment's notice outside of the country, having been here for a period that suited them and having availed of the various tax concessions offered.However, much of the increased industrial unrest is occurring within the public sector. Some of this is a result of the Government's dealings with the public sector. There have been unnecessary confrontation and ill-defined polices that create for many public sector workers an uncertainty as to their future. For example, not only have prison officers been affected, but those in the ancillary services to the Prison Service. At Spike Island Prison, workers in the education sector are uncertain because of ministerial statements made up this week. I say "made up" because many Government announcements seem to be off the top of the head. Then there is the Government deciding whether to privatise or change the company formation of other public companies such as Aer Rianta, the ESB and Aer Lingus. This is all done in a ham-fisted manner that is leading to an era where industrial unrest will be more likely. If that occurs, the Government will have to take a great deal of responsibility for it.Some industrial disputes have occurred as the last kick of a dying company or industry. The situation in IFI was badly handled by the Minister. There are also those in the private sector who are abusing redundancy legislation. Questions have existed over the scale of redundancy payments and the future of pension provisions. In Cork, there was also the manner in which the ADM dispute was handled. This was nothing less than a lockout by employers of workers who legitimately wanted to carry out their work. This is the very type of victimisation that this Bill professes to address but it will not do so.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a great difficulty in that it is attempting to speak through both sides of its mouth. The focus of our policy in attracting foreign direct investment is persuading multinational companies to locate here on the basis that they will not have to deal with workers who are part of trade union structures. At the same time, the Department is introducing legislation that professes to protect and improve such rights. The Department, the Government and, in particular, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, cannot have it both ways.The Green Party wants to see a serious attempt to bring forward a framework for industrial peace that will live long into the future. That is not without its dangers because one might find a situation where various actors are either offended or rewarded too much. There was the infamous introduction of such a policy in the UK in the late 1960s. Barbara Castle, the then Minister for Employment and Productivity, introduced a White Paper, In Place of Strife, that upset the UK trade unions. Whatever about the content of that policy and the fact that it was applicable to Britain, I do not see any real attempt by the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment or the Government to introduce an all-embracing policy in terms of workers' rights, freedom to associate, and how and when trade unions should interact in industrial policy. The Government has too much of a crutch in the social partnership process.This legislation introduces and gives further resources to structures that ordinarily should not exist. We in this House should have huge question marks over why people have to seek forms of redress for what should be natural constitutional rights. However, to satisfy agreements that have been made with actors in the social partnership process, we are prepared to prioritise the business of this House to make sure those commitments are maintained and other more important commitments are not considered.In future social partnership should be structured so that it is an equal and valid partnership. Earlier I mentioned that the Dáil does not have the right to vindicate the agreements through approval by this Chamber. It is also unusual that if those within the community and voluntary pillar reject an agreement, they put themselves outside the pale. What type of partnership is that? Those who do not agree with the agreement have to go somewhere else and are not involved in the future processes. For this reason, groups like the National Women's Council of Ireland and Community Platform are not involved.I would be very surprised if this were the case for ICTU or IBEC. In such a case it would be argued that there would be no agreement. However, social partnership would continue in some other form. They would have more negotiation and come up with a different agreement. Part of this different but equal approach within social partnership means that a key party can say: "Either you agree with us or you are out, but if you are one of the really important parties in the social partnership we will keep working until we agree."  That type of double standard does not help the social partnership process. For those of us who are excluded by our membership of the Opposition, it does not help the quality of public life or decision-making.This is a slight Bill that introduces reforms of a small nature, which are welcome in that they go in a particular direction. I remain disappointed that it does not address the wider issue and produce policies in the area of industrial harmony and peace. I do not expect it will be a policy priority of the Tánaiste to do so. If any lesson can be taken from this legislation and its accompanying debate it should be that we will have future legislation that will give greater hope to those who have been badly treated by the existing legislation.

#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, the purpose of which is to implement the specific measures contained in sections 8.8 to 8.11 of part 2 of Sustaining Progress. The measures are also intended to enhance the effectiveness of existing dispute resolution procedures, which were put in place by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution by introducing timescales. Section 8.9 of Sustaining Progress specifies that an indicative overall timeframe targeting 26 weeks – with provision for up to a maximum of 34 weeks where necessary – for the processing of cases under the dispute resolution code would be introduced, which is why this Bill is necessary.We are very fortunate that industrial relations have always been dealt with on a voluntary basis. There has been consensus among social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining. The Government has done everything it can to support this voluntary process, which has worked very well on our behalf over the years.In the course of time we have had to introduce certain dispute resolution services. Last night the Minister of State indicated that he fully supports this and he gave some figures indicating the success we have had. The Labour Relations Commission chaired more than 2,000 meetings last year, 80% of which resulted in settlement of disputes. This is an excellent success rate, which shows the mechanism has worked very well. It is unfortunate that from time to time issues are not resolved through the Labour Relations Commission and need to be referred for further investigation to the Labour Court. While the recommendations issued by the court are non-binding, there is an acceptance rate of more than 80% by the parties to the dispute.The mechanism in place has worked well and it has served the country well to have a voluntary approach, which is welcomed by employer organisations, trade unions, staff organisations and individual staff members. However a number of issues have arisen. One of the reasons for having this Bill is that there has been a degree of frustration particularly with the lack of timescales for dealing with disputes, which is specifically addressed in the Bill. There have been complaints over the length of time taken to process cases through the Labour Court. Matters should be brought to a head within a reasonable length of time.Section 2 of the Bill deletes section 2(1)(b) of the Act of 2001 and replaces it with a provision which allows the court to investigate a trade dispute if one of the following three conditions have been met: a breach of the timescale in the amended code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution; the exhaustion of the timescales in the amended code of practice; or the receipt of a report from the Labour Relations Commission that no further efforts on the part of the commission will advance the resolution of the dispute. This section tries to deal with disputes in an effective way rather than allow them to go on endlessly with no resolution in sight. I welcome this provision.Section 3 replaces section 3 of the Act of 2001. This section enables the Labour Court to allocate its resources more efficiently by allowing it to combine preliminary and substantive hearings in a dispute referred to it under section 2(1) of the Act of 2001. This goes a long way towards reducing the length of time taken by the Labour Court in conducting an investigation. It is still possible to take the preliminary hearings and substantial hearings separately. However, if the court feels time would be saved by combining them it will now be possible to do so, which is an important improvement in the 2001 Act. The length of time involved in resolving the dispute has caused considerable disquiet among parties that have had to go to the Labour Court.Section 4 replaces section 10 of the Act of 2001 to enable a trade union or excepted body to apply to the Circuit Court for the enforcement of a Labour Court determination. If an employer has failed to implement its terms, the Labour Court determination is binding and enforceable by order to the Circuit Court. As I mentioned, in most cases the Labour Court is very successful and parties accept its decision. It is hoped this trend will continue. However, we are all aware of a number of past disputes that have been quite contentious. When the Labour Court makes its recommendations it is important that the parties to the dispute implement those recommendations. If they fail to do so, it should be possible to go to court to ensure the parties comply. I welcome this section, which will enhance the resolution of disputes and importantly will give this Bill some kick and power.Section 5 provides for the processing of cases, which had, at the date of enactment, been referred to the Labour Court under the Act of 2001. These cases will now be treated under the new legislation. This is a procedural matter and it is important that any benefits that may arise under the new Bill should be applicable for cases previously referred to the Labour Court under the 2001 Act.As well as the issue of the timeframe, one of the critical areas for complaint under the current mechanisms is victimisation. I am delighted the Bill deals comprehensively with the issue, specifically under section 8 where victimisation is defined. It allows for acts to be specified and the code of practice on victimisation to be included in the definition. A complaint of victimisation may be made in circumstances where there is a trade dispute in which the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been or is intended to be invoked, and arises where an employee's membership or activity on behalf of a trade union is challenged by an employer, or where a manager discharges his or her managerial functions. When taken in conjunction with section 9 which deals with complaints of victimisation, it empowers a rights commissioner to hear those complaints from an employee, trade union or accepted body and to make a decision on the matter. The section also provides that a rights commissioner may award compensation where he or she considers that to be equitable.If we are serious about eradicating victimisation, the last part of the section, which allows compensation to be awarded, is important. It shows that we are trying to tackle a problem that exists in the workplace. Other Members have given examples of where victimisation might take place, whether to a member of a trade union, a political party or whatever. It is important that it is not tolerated in our system and that we are serious as legislators about its eradication. For that reason I welcome in particular these two sections which deal with victimisation.It is also important that there is an appeals mechanism to the Labour Court arising from a decision of a rights commissioner. This is specified under section 10. It is one's right and entitlement to have an avenue for appeal. The Labour Court is empowered to take evidence on oath under section 11, to administer oaths and to compel a person to attend to give evidence where there is an appeal of a rights commissioner's decision in a victimisation case. This is critical. We all know there are parties who are guilty of victimisation and are reluctant to come forward and give evidence. It is important that they are compelled to do so in such situations. This part of the Bill's "get-tough" mechanism shows our determination to tackle these problems.The two most important sections deal with the timescale within which disputes can be settled and the victimisation issue. If we can cater satisfactorily for these two areas, it will allow an equitable system to exist within our industrial relations environment. It will also mean that disputes do not drag on endlessly without resolution and that people can see some light at the end of the tunnel.The voluntary manner in which we have dealt with industrial relations over the past ten to 15 years has been a great success. It is to be hoped that the mechanisms in place, such as the Labour Court, will be used as last resorts and that the voluntary system of resolving disputes about terms and conditions of employment will continue. Disputes will occur occasionally, however, and it is important that the supportive legislation is in place to allow the voluntary mechanism to continue. I believe the Bill does this and I commend it to the House.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I listened carefully to the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, and was impressed by what he said and the manner in which he dealt with the subject. I sometimes make the point, not flippantly, that I was not born a politician. In fact, there was a time when I was quite normal. Throughout my life I have had normal jobs. I reflect on that when looking at this important legislation.When I left school, I went to London for a while and then returned to Dublin. I worked in three different companies during that part of my career, about 40 years ago. Times were different in Dublin then, as was the industrial relations climate. I recall working for an old Dublin company, which has survived to this day in different forms, where I became involved in trade union issues. I became an assistant to the shop steward and was for a while a member of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.When I moved to Tallaght first, in 1969, and changed jobs, I became a shop steward in a warehouse. I recall that I was interested in the work and enjoyed being able to make my own contribution in those days when I was much younger and probably less wise. I do not know whether I am wiser today, but they were different times.I recall being promoted to manager of the warehouse. Many of my colleagues felt at the time that the main reason for the promotion was that I had been such an effective shop steward. I always denied that. Those are the experiences I draw on when examining this legislation. It is a part of my life of which I am proud.It is important that we appreciate how much work has been done on the industrial relations front. Over the years, perhaps because of the challenging times we lived through, certain aspects of industrial relations lapsed to some degree. In the 1970s and 1980s it was a question of holding down a job and doing one's best to stay in employment. That is why it is timely that the Government is bringing forward this legislation.There are still issues and challenges to be faced. People are still being victimised. There is still a need to deal with industrial relations problems. That is evident every day, although they may not be highlighted as much as in the past. While most of the problems we as politicians encounter in our clinics relate to housing, social welfare and the issues of the day, I receive a good number of representations regarding industrial relations issues, with some claiming they are being victimised and others believing they are being made redundant by their employers before the year is over. These issues still exist. It is good that we acknowledge the legislation and appreciate what the Minister of State said, namely, that the basic aim of the Bill is to strengthen industrial relations procedures and give effect to the Industrial Relations Act 2001.Many workers who are members of trade unions, some of which are headed by the ICTU, will be pleased with this legislation. From having listened to the speeches, I was glad to find that Members were in general agreement on the Bill. There will always be the dotting of the "i"s and crossing of the "t"s where some of these matters are concerned. Colleagues on the Opposition benches, such as Deputy Boyle, will take the opportunity to make their political points and that is fair enough. If I remain in the Chamber, Deputy Ring will probably entertain me with a few more. However, even Deputy Ring, fair man that he is, will understand the merits of this legislation and give the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, his head. Perhaps we could ask the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to convey this message, because this is good legislation that will have enormous support.It is fair to reflect on what the Minister of State said in his speech about the system of industrial relations essentially being voluntary in nature. This is important. The approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. There is an often expressed consensus among the social partners that workers' terms and conditions of employment are perhaps best determined through voluntary bargaining – between employers' associations and one or more of the trade unions or staff associations. We should look at this in a positive manner, bearing in mind that this approach has served us well over the years.I have 40 years experience of being in the workforce. As a Dáil Deputy this is the first time I am in a job where I am not sure of the future, although I am confident about it. I always had a sense in my previous jobs that they were more permanent and more normal. Good trade union mechanisms were in place. Co-operation and a positive attitude existed between trade unions and employers. I was a member for many years of the then Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.Debate on the Bill provides an opportunity to acknowledge the work of trade unions. We should pay tribute to those who have contributed enormously to the relationship between the trade union movement and employers. There is widespread support for this legislation and it is fitting that it be brought up to date.Other colleagues have closely examined the legislation on a section by section basis so I do not feel the need to do so. A number of aspects of the Bill are especially welcome.Backbenchers, Government backbenchers in particular, have an important role in listening to constituents and others, such as those in the trade union movement. At a time when the Minister of State is under pressure for various reasons, he listened carefully to what was said. This is reflected in the contents of the Bill, which I expect will receive widespread approval. The Minister of State should be complimented in this regard.I am enthusiastic about the Bill. It will be welcomed, not only in Dublin South-West which I represent, but throughout the country. I hope there will be a positive reaction to it in the House. I commend the Bill and wish the Minister of State well in dealing with the legislation.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Although I have 20 minutes in which to speak I can assure the Acting Chairman that I will not take that long.What Deputy O'Connor said in regard to the proposed legislation is correct. I have never seen legislation come through this House where there was not a trick at the end of it. We got caught with the Planning and Development Act 2000, of which we see the effects this week. I hope this legislation is positive for workers' rights.I compliment the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court on the job they have done. There is no doubt that they resolved many disputes over the years, on which they worked hard. They have to make decisions on all disputes that come before them. Parties in dispute accepted some 80% of their recommendations.I often wish we had some kind of union representation in the House. Instead of getting three and a half years or five years, if the unions were stronger than the politicians we might be able to get a longer time in the House without going before the people.A union might also do something for us in regard to the incitement to hatred Act. In recent years the Act could be used against the way certain people have targeted politicians. As in every other sector in society there are good and bad politicians. Some 99.9% of the people who have served in the House have done the job in an honourable way. In recent weeks people, including the media, were most vicious about politics and politicians.The media would say I am giving out about them. When the Dáil returned recently the most important issue, as far as I was concerned, was the landslide at Pullathomas, County Mayo, which I raised as a matter on the Adjournment. There were not enough seats for the journalists in the Gallery for the row that took place earlier about Deputy Collins. No coverage was given that day to the people of north Mayo even though it was the first time that the Minister was responding on the matter.During the summer months people in the media come to us looking for stories. They feed and live off us yet if the incitement to hatred Act was looked at there could be many prosecutions in the courts. There is not a great deal of sympathy for politicians and politics so I suppose I am flogging a dead horse.Two major elements are evident in the Bill, one of which is the timeframe of disputes. If one can nip a dispute in the bud at an early stage it stops the bitterness that can creep in if it is left to drag on. Friction is created in companies when people are not receiving a salary. People come under pressure from management to break up the dispute. It is vital that the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court be involved as quickly as possible so that an early decision can be reached. In 80% of cases the parties to the dispute accepted these decisions. People have a right to be represented by a union. Although unions have had a bad name for a long time, they are a necessary evil.Recently a young man who had just started work came to see me. The Revenue Commissioners or some Department should examine what happens when young people start work. This young man, who was living in rented accommodation, had been working for seven or eight weeks. He was being taxed at 42% because his employer had not sent in a form. In the past this was done automatically but now employers do not seem to do it. This individual was still paying emergency tax because he was not properly set up in regard to the Revenue Commissioners.I have never seen advertisements from the Revenue Commissioners or any Department to advise people of what they should do when they begin work. The new system gives everybody a PPS number from the moment of birth. People should be informed about what to do when they get a job, either at school or in third level colleges. They need to be advised about which forms they need to complete. The Government levies emergency tax on people but does not explain how to reclaim it or how soon it is possible to deal with the matter. It is something that should be considered. There are enough spin doctors and advertising agencies within Departments to inform people starting work for the first time about taxation and pensions. It is about time that happened. When someone leaves school to work for the first time, he or she does not understand how the system operates and should be helped.The young man in the case I mentioned lives in rented accommodation and does not receive the money he needs. He is under pressure for the past few weeks because he is working long hours. He is taxed at 42% and no one told him how to reclaim the money. He started work this year and brought a previous P45 to his employers which did not reach the Revenue Commissioners. I had to make a phone call yesterday after which the system was set up for him. If a Department does not have responsibility for something, it should pass it on to the Department which does to ensure that, when young people start working, these matters are explained to them.I listened earlier to the reference to blackspots. I hope the Government will consider their location when it introduces decentralisation in the next few months. I hope to see Departments establishing offices in areas which have suffered from a great deal of unemployment over the years, one of which is my area of north Mayo. The recent census revealed north Mayo to have been one of the areas which has suffered most from unemployment. I hope that can be dealt with.Victimisation is the one issue I am pleased to see being dealt with in the Bill. How often have we heard it said of someone that they should not be employed because they are union members and troublemakers or that they nearly closed down a nearby factory? Such people are needed because they represent workers and unions. Over the years, they were given a bad name and were certainly victimised in terms of promotion and further employment. I am glad to see this being dealt with in the legislation. It is wrong that someone should be victimised because they are doing a job well and representing workers. I hope the Bill's provisions work because it is wrong that someone who does a job well should be penalised.It is important that disputes can be referred to the Labour Court as soon as possible to enable it to make a recommendation quickly. It is also necessary that people who want to be in a union are allowed to join one. I am open to correction, but it is my understanding that the Bill provides that office workers can bring their grievances to the Labour Relations Commission, even if they are not members of a union. That provision should be made.There are a great many small businesses with few employees which do not justify the presence of a union. At the same time, there should be some representation for workers in these businesses and they should have a forum in which to resolve disputes which arise. That is better than permitting a problem to build up in an office to the point where people have to leave because there is no referee. I hope I am correct that such a provision is made in the Bill.People refer to social partnership. There is no doubt that industrial relations have improved in recent years and we have seen fewer strikes. It is important that employers and employees honour the agreements which have been made and bring in the changes that have been requested. Good industrial relations are important to sustaining employment levels. We must have employers who have no problem with union representation for their workers.On the other hand, we must look at the foreign companies that have located here and which do not want union representation for their employees. The unions are not too happy about this. There have been many Irish companies which have not wanted union representation either. The time has come to ensure that people have a right to join a union if they wish to do so. Their right to bring a union into a company should be protected.We see what is happening to foreign workers who come here on work permits. These people come to me in my capacity as a public representative and I find in some cases that they work 17 and 18 hours per day. They cannot complain because the person who holds the work permit is their employer. That is wrong. These people feel there is no one to represent them. The Minister and his Department should consider the right of people who come here to work to have union representation. There needs to be some means for them to air their views in the event of a dispute and someone to arbitrate on it. What is happening is not good. Many of these people are treated in the way the Irish were many years ago when they went to America and Britain.I hope this legislation proves to be positive and that its provisions on timeframes work. When disputes occur, they should be dealt with as quickly as possible. I hope industrial relations will continue in the way they have in recent years.The social partnership negotiations have probably taken responsibilities from the House that should be dealt with by it. Representatives of the various groups meet in Government Buildings and spend a number of weeks reaching an agreement. Many debates take place there rather than in the House. While that is another issue, there should be discussions of social partnership issues as negotiations take place. When the negotiations end, the House should be told what has been agreed. We should not be isolated.I welcome the Bill and hope the people who need the Labour Court can access it and that it will work speedily. I compliment the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court on doing an excellent job over the years. We do not have the opportunity often enough to compliment them. They have a difficult job and have worked fairly to deal with disputes and make decisions. Those decisions have worked well.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	150	It is instructive that a Bill entitled the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill should have emerged from the Sustaining Progress agreement. It offers some protection for workers against victimisation due to trade union membership. We have all seen examples of such victimisation in our experiences over the years in our respective constituencies and in the wider field. I must emphasise that the Bill offers only some protection.Why should so basic a right as labour representation be up for negotiation? Why should trade unions have to bargain with Government and employers for the right of workers to join trade unions and to have the opportunity of effective collective representation? These are questions which need to be asked. It shines a light on the reality of the relationship between Government and the trade unions. That they should have to do so tells us much about the status of workers' rights and the flawed nature of the so-called partnership process.Some 90 years ago employers, such as William Martin Murphy, joined together to crush the trade union movement in the infamous lock-out of 1913. Disgraceful scenes were played out in this city as the various arms of State were brought to bear in a brutal manner on innocent protesting workers, some of whom lost their lives. The workers demonstrated and campaigned for the right to be members of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. Other protests and exercises took place in other parts of the island at the time. In the years which followed, the trade union movement flourished but its great days have passed and today, sadly, we see a very different picture.I pay particular tribute to those who were at the coalface and spearheaded the development of the trade union movement in my constituency, particularly in my community, my native Monaghan. Their rise coincided with the advent of partial independence on the island and the early decades of native enterprise and address of the failure of the previous system imposed on us to meet the needs of Irish workers.Today, nine decades after the 1913 lock-out, the right to be a trade union member is not recognised in legislation and there are no guarantees. We do not have the protections necessary, as is exemplified on the streets of Dublin today. Multinational companies are given every facility to establish here and benefit from one of the lowest corporation tax rates anywhere in the world, but are allowed to operate a policy of non-recognition of unions. We can be no more proud of native companies than inward investors who exploit Irish and other workers, and the tragedy of this Bill is that it will do little to change that.I have spoken many times in this Chamber about the Government's woeful mishandling of waste management in all its dimensions. I referred to the disgraceful scenes of workers having to protest in Dublin today to establish their rights to trade union membership and representation. I refer specifically to the dispute at the Oxigen waste management company, which operates a huge contract for Dublin City Council. The Government has facilitated and encouraged the privatisation of waste management by local authorities, which the Minister might say she is proud of. Privatisation takes away democratic accountability for essential services, including decision-making powers on such key matters as charges and waivers. I regret greatly that in my county there is no longer a local authority controlled waste collection system – the entire collection service in County Monaghan is privatised and I very much regret that.Another result of privatisation is that Oxigen refuses to recognise the right of its workers to join a union, which workers in that sector have exercised and enjoyed for decades. The conduct of this company is a downright disgrace and is a throwback to the ethos which applied in the employer sector in 1913. Shamefully, non-union labour has been hired to do the work of the locked-out employees. The company has employed immigrants to break the strike and it is alleged that these workers have, in turn, been threatened with the loss of their work permits if they attempt to join a union. Using worker against worker and taking the selfish interest of great profits, exploiting workers at every level and turning them on each other is a disgraceful manipulation of good and ordinary decent people.Lorries are being driven at speed through the picket lines which are being maintained by the 56 workers. Last week, the strikers' caravan at Ballymount was burned out – the Minister may be aware of that. Such a practice should be roundly condemned, although I have not heard it mentioned by any Government spokespersons who are often quick to condemn other actions.The four Sinn Féin councillors on Dublin City Council, together with the Labour Party members, tabled a motion on 3 November supporting the Oxigen workers in their strike for the right to union membership and, very importantly, calling on the city manager to ensure that all contractors recognise trade union rights. Disgracefully, the motion was ruled out of order by the council's legal adviser, who judged that the city manager was not empowered to implement it. This is another example of how local democracy has been rendered completely powerless. Basic protection cannot be offered to workers whose wages come indirectly from public funds.I will not oppose this Bill because there are important elements of it. The main difficulty I have is that it does not go far enough; it is far from adequate. Trade union recognition should be copperfastened in more comprehensive legislation. I encourage the Government to address this absolute requirement. The right to work should be properly recognised so that we do not have the scandalous abuse of the work permit system by employers. At present permits are held by employers rather than employees. That approach should be abolished since it is another throwback to times past when workers were tied to employers as indentured servants.Yesterday's national media referred to an asylum applicant who is placed in Mosney in the north-east and is now on the tenth day of a hunger strike, protesting that he is denied the dignity of the right to work while his papers are being processed. I emphasise this aspect because it is hugely important. The refusal of the right to work has clearly drawn a distinction in the minds of many between those who are brought in here specifically to carry out particular work functions and others who come to our shores seeking an opportunity. They are often either in flight from oppression or seek a new economic break in this country which is something we enjoyed on other shores over centuries. It is important that this issue is addressed substantively.We must make it clear that everyone in our society, indigenous or otherwise, recognises that those who come to these shores are here to play their part as constructive contributors to the overall labour pool. They wish to be fully compliant, unlike many in the indigenous community, with our tax laws. It is important that we take heed of this process. We must recognise that people denied the dignity of work will, of course, have recourse to drastic protests.I also wish to highlight the need to introduce into our education system an appreciation of the rights of workers and the importance of the vindication of those rights. We had a school visiting group in the Visitors' Gallery this morning. This area is not reflected adequately within the CSPE curriculum. Future employers and employees should have a shared understanding of the importance of the right to trade union membership and representation and of representative bargaining with employers. The only way we can ensure and guarantee this is to introduce it in the school curriculum in order to ensure at the earliest stage possible, an appreciation of the importance of equity and fairness in all our dealings throughout our lives.I pay particular tribute to those within the trade union movement who have honourably and stoically stood by the rights of workers and who fearlessly campaign in their interests. I pay tribute also to the trades councils, particularly the trades councils in my county. They have demonstrated a keen awareness of the important role they can play, within the overall configuration of society, in ensuring a strong voice in the interests of workers and of fair play and equity in our communities. This important role needs to be acknowledged and appreciated by all sides.Sinn Féin will not oppose this Bill. We urge the Government to recognise the importance of introducing effective legislation which will, once and for all, copperfasten in law the rights of workers to trade union membership and representation. This basic and fundamental right needs to be guaranteed in law.

Everybody talks about partnership and how much it has meant to us. With partnership comes commitment. There has been major commitment towards getting on with the process and this marks where we are now. Everybody realises that we must get on with it. We have seen how working together, based on agreement, has made a difference to our economy over the years. The whole process is brought about through agreement of everybody involved, IBEC, the ICTU and others.This Bill extends the existing legislation to give the Labour Court new powers to resolve disputes in circumstances where the parties have not engaged in talks, where negotiation arrangements are not in place and where collective bargaining fails to take place. Social partnership has been the essential ingredient of success in previous agreements like the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and currently Sustaining Progress, which will expire in 2005. These programmes have played a major part in transforming every sector of the Irish economy. Unfortunately, we still have inadequacies in society. These have been well highlighted in pre-budget submissions by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others.In the course of negotiations between the social partners leading to the adoption of Sustaining Progress, the trade union negotiators sought significant amendments to the previous Industrial Relations Act including mandatory trade union recognition. The current Bill incorporates some improvements but the key demand of the trade unions to have the legal right to represent members where they choose, has still not been met. While it remains a trade union demand, it is not addressed in this Bill. The Bill fails to meet the concerns of trade union members regarding recognition of their union and their right to choose to be represented by a trade union.I am a member of the IMO which is a trade union. Trade unionism is a way of countering the employer end of the equation. As one who worked in various jobs as a student before qualifying as a doctor, I have seen the issue from different perspectives. Different perspectives colour people's outlook depending on the situation from which they come. For example, people might come from a situation where they have seen discrimination against family members in the workplace. If they are from an employer background and run a business they see things from that perspective. The good thing about the agreement process is that people are prepared to look at both sides. They realise that there will be no progress otherwise.There are 600,000 more people employed than in 1992 as a result of the partnership approach. We need to remain competitive. With the enlargement of the EU, we will have to compete with many others for jobs. We have already seen that if we lose our competitive edge, the jobs go elsewhere. Our dependence on multinationals, which has been important to our development, has meant that we are subject to their whim. We need to ensure that we encourage indigenous industry as much as possible through providing the proper infrastructure. It is Government policy to have balanced regional development but we must provide the infrastructure to ensure we get the industry.Industrial jobs are declining. We in the west need to know that we can be in a position to attract whatever jobs are available. We cannot do that unless we have the infrastructure, the roads and rail services. Some important projects like the western rail corridor and Knock Airport need investment. Knock Airport, although an international airport, has not received the same investment as Dublin, Cork or Shannon.Returning to the Bill, it is important that we seek agreement. The Bill is logical and promotes the process of trying to seek agreement. It is only at the end of the day that the big guns are brought in to try and get a resolution to the process. Much of our time and many of our resources are wasted. This leads to the enrichment of lawyers who like to bring every dispute to the courts with the result that taxpayers end up paying higher insurance, etc.Let us consider how partnership has worked for us. We have gone from 583,000 workdays lost in the 1970s to 97,046 workdays lost in 2000. That is a big improvement, from 192 strikes in 1984 to 39 in 2000. Social partnership, therefore, has been good for us. There is a cost involved, with benchmarking, etc., but this is one which needs to be paid because it is the price of a stable economy, which is so important to us.We must remember, on the other hand, that the vast majority of people in private sector employment are not in unions and we must respect this right as well. We must respect the right of people to get on with it. We need to keep our competitive edge but we also need to ensure that our workers are happy, productive and competitive.If, as in the Shannon region, there was a special tax incentive scheme for my area in Mayo, it would have meant so much and would allow us to attract the type of industry we need to keep our people there. Half our graduates must go to Dublin to get their first job. Dublin is overburdened already. The price of providing services for all those people who really do not want to be in the Dublin area, and who would wish to be in the west but who must go to Dublin, and of keeping them there, would be far less than giving the services through balanced regional development which would be much more cost-effective for Government. I need not go into the price of a mile of motorway compared to that of tarring a road or ensuring proper access in the west. It makes great sense. We have services there. We have schools which should not close down. We have electricity and all the other services. We just need the people, but to have them we need something to keep and bring them there. I hope the Minister will think hard about decentralisation when it comes up because that is one sure way to attract people and enterprise. It has worked in the past and certainly will work again.One must remember that the highest unemployment rate in Mayo is in the Pullathomas-Inver area. According to the figures of Séamus Caulfield, every DED west of a line from Killala to Newport has shown a negative balance, except two, one of which is Mulranney and the other of which is slightly up from there. The bottom line is that we need some of the investment from down here.Partnership can accomplish so much. The unions have the potential, as the Government has, to work together. That potential has been exercised to a degree but it needs to be continued. There is so much that needs to be done – there are real people's needs – and the programme does spell out all the good things that can happen. There are very good provisions contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness about all the good which needs to happen in areas such as housing, social housing, proper cancer services, etc., and on which we need to work. The Cancer Care Alliance, for instance, is composed of many people – Members of the Oireachtas, the community, the unions, etc. Everybody working together can accomplish so much, everybody pulling against each other has the opposite effect.This is a good Bill because it brings to bear many important mechanisms in a logical progression and it is an improvement to the extent that it takes away the opportunity for employers to frustrate the process because of the tight timeframes, etc. If employers are not using the process meaningfully, the trade unions will be enabled to call a halt to it and proceed directly to the Labour Court for the determination of a grievance. In the event of a dispute being referred to the Labour Relations Commission and that commission advising the Labour Court of its inability to achieve a resolution of a particular dispute, the trade union may refer the dispute to the Circuit Court.We must always remember people who are not members of unions. Some 70% of companies in the private sector are not unionised. Their staff do not have the right to be represented by a trade union but we must recognise that in the Constitution there is the understanding that people have a right to disassociate or associate.We need to look at what comes out of this. The definition of collective bargaining will be important because so much hinges on it. Where collective bargaining does not take place the trade unions are permitted to process claims on behalf of their members, but we need to know what collective bargaining means and this is important. Perhaps the answer is having the Labour Court decide what constitutes collective bargaining. It may well be that there are devices where people such as employers can get around this. I suppose it will be up to the Labour Court to decide, or it should be.This is an important Bill, but there are situations for which it does not provide. For example, it does not define "employee". I particularly welcome the aspect of the Bill dealing with victimisation. Everybody would abhor the bullying or harassment of employees, particularly those belonging to a union. While that is probably alleged, if it is a bona fide case it needs to be addressed. Codes of practice are good. They give people guidelines, through which they can go and which will help them. The Bill provides that where a trade union intends to refer or has referred a dispute to the Labour Court, no employee may be victimised on account of his or her membership or otherwise of a trade union or any union activity.There is also provision for a complaint of victimisation to be made to a rights commissioner within six months of the alleged instance. The rights commissioner may investigate an issue for determination, awarding up to two years' remuneration as compensation.I am glad to have spoken on this Bill. It is an important move in the right direction and I congratulate everybody involved with it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill. Before I get into the details of this legislation, let me first state that some employers would want to get their act together in the way they treat their staff. There is now a new arrogant macho-type management style emerging. It is essential that they are tackled head-on and told their style is a thing of the past. It is bad for industrial relations, for all staff, for the consumer and, if they look deeper into themselves, for productivity and quality service. Their arrogance and self-importance is costing them money, and also future customers.Whether one is a top chief executive or a Minister, people must always be treated in a fair and just manner. Anyone interested in serious industrial relations has got to wake up to this reality. These issues are particularly relevant to this debate in the Dáil.The purpose of the Bill is to implement the specific measures contained in section 8.9 of Part 2 of Sustaining Progress which are intended to enhance the effectiveness of the procedures put in place by the Industrial Relations Act 2001. Section 7 enables the Labour Court to give priority to cases it considers reasonable, referred to it under the Act. I welcome this section as it allows and provides for speedy resolutions of disputes.Section 9 empowers a rights commissioner to hear a complaint of victimisation from an employee, a trade union or an excepted body, and to make a decision on the matter. This section is very relevant to some of the industrial relations problems being experienced in the State. On the workers at Oxigen Environmental Limited who wish to join the trade union movement, for example, imagine that in this day and age a group of workers are not allowed to join a union of their choice. It is a disgrace and I call on everyone to support the Oxigen workers. Dublin City Council must also accept some of the responsibility for the current situation as it awarded the contract to this company to collect our green bins. Trade union recognition is a basic human right and it can never be tolerated that companies treat their staff in such a manner.While I welcome this legislation, and it is a major step in the right direction, I would like to see proper rights and recognition for all workers. For example, the Cabinet is not prepared to listen to the sensible and progressive ideas of the staff regarding the proposed break-up of Aer Rianta. Our airports are at risk and I urge the Minister to listen to the real economic arguments in this debate.The same is happening in the prison officers' dispute. Taking a hard stance or bullying one's way around the Prison Service is not a responsible way for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to act, and it goes against the ethos of this Bill. People in the Prison Service have a very difficult job, as I know through having dealt with them for the past 15 to 20 years. They should never be treated in this way. I urge the Government to talk further with the Prison Officers' Association. Privatising the Prison Service will be a disaster. The Prison Officers' Association proposal to secure savings of €30 million should be considered seriously. There is no point talking about this legislation today if we do not treat trade union organisations such as that one with respect and dignity.I also encourage the trade union movement to look into its own heart, note how the leadership is drifting away from the poorer sections of society and ask itself why 30% of our population feels excluded, ignored and marginalised. It must fight for the rights of those people. Cosying up to Government, not showing leadership or going with mainstream society is not good trade unionism and it is bad for future industrial relations. These are the types of tough decisions which the leadership of the trade union movement must take. It is time to remind ourselves of people such as Connolly and the late Mattie Merrigan who always put working people first and looked out for the marginalised in our society. The trade union movement must remind itself of these men's vision.I see myself as a part of that movement, having been a member of the INTO for over 20 years. Let us get back to the men and women of no property and fight for the 50,000 people on social housing waiting lists. It is essential that the trade union movement take a broader line than just on wages and conditions when discussing this Bill, particularly on industrial relations. I feel very strongly about this. While our top priority should be looking after our members and their working conditions, we must also set the broader agenda. The run-up to the budget is an ideal time for this. We have to do something in this budget. Recent budgets have favoured the affluent sections of society. They have consistently widened the income gap between the poor and the well-off and have created a less equal society. This is an issue for the trade union movement.Despite improvements there are still unacceptable levels of consistent and relative poverty. There are nearly 300,000 children living in households with a weekly income of less than €175. That is relative poverty. There are 70,000 children living in bad conditions where they have neither warm meals nor warm coats, and their families are in debt and have to rely on charitable organisations. There are children attending primary schools every day who are undernourished and in some cases hungry because they live in low income households. There is the scandal of 50,000 households on waiting lists for social housing which represents more than 120,000 people. There are also people on low incomes neglecting their health because they cannot afford health care.The trade unions must look at these types of issue and take them on board when discussing industrial relations and so forth. These issues must be the kernel of the trade union movement which must look after people in receipt of social welfare and families on low incomes, and deal with housing and education.Let us remind ourselves of the crime problems in the broader society. Among the 70,000 children living in extreme poverty there are 1,800 to 3,000 living in very violent and dysfunctional families. These are the children who will end up in the hands of the Prison Service, they are the future gangland members. If we do not tackle issues of this kind in a debate on crime we are taking our eye off the ball. I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to listen to the argument for targeting resources on the most needy, including those 70,000 families who should be given help in every way possible.We have started some projects and I welcome them, particularly the breakfast and homework clubs and intervention at pre-school level because by the time these children reach ten, 11 or 12 they are lost. If we do not get them before they are three or four they are already on the way to prison. We must consider and deal with these problems in regard to future industrial relations issues too. If we face up to them we will have fewer industrial relations problems and a calmer, safer and more caring society. The Labour Court could become redundant if people stopped labelling other people and discussed and listened to their ideas.The Aer Rianta row is another example of this. Ministers seem to be driven by ideology and are riding roughshod over trade union members without listening to balanced economic and social arguments. Many members of the public are not aware of the reality of Aer Rianta. It is a national asset, the jewel in our crown. It made €36 million in profit and returned €8 million in dividends to the Exchequer last year. The charges there are €5.36 and even the regulator says that they are too low. This is an important company that is doing great work and providing excellent jobs. It needs modernisation and efficiency, but the Government is not handling this issue in the right way. Look at how the Minister for Transport handled it – on 10 July he announced the break-up of Aer Rianta and on 18 July he agreed to a two-week period of reflection. While the unions were reflecting the Minister undermined their agreements by forging ahead and announcing the new board members. On 1 August the unions received shallow commitments to discussions on the break-up. On 20 August unions clarified that Aer Rianta could not give assurances regarding jobs, terms or pensions. To add insult to injury, on 26 August the Minister employed consultants to assist the break-up process.Is it right during a time of so-called partnership that the Minister refuses to provide real reasons for the break-up? Does 15 minutes of a discussion with union leaders in eight months constitute respectful recognition of airport workers' concerns? Is it understood that as a consequence of the Minister's proposal hundreds of millions of euro, returned to the Government through the efforts of Aer Rianta workers, which could help improve health, housing and education, will be gone forever? This is their side of the discussion today on the proposed Industrial Relations Act.I raise these issues because if one is to have quality industrial relations one has to listen to the voices of people on the ground. I have posed many questions, for the Government and employers, but I have equally posed questions for trade union leaders on the direction in which they are going. It is essential that we deal with these issues in this discussion. The Bill is a step in the right direction and it has potential, but workers' rights must always be protected in a society that claims to be democratic and inclusive.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I too welcome the Bill. This approach to ensuring that those who are not represented fully by trade unions have an opportunity to resolve their disputes is necessary. There was always a large group of employees who were not able to negotiate with their employer because on most of these occasions the employer would not accept that they could be represented. Even if the person was in a trade union the union had a negotiating understanding with the employer, and employers are within their rights to do that.I have 20 years' experience in industrial relations as a management representative. The trade union movement in Ireland has played an enormous role in developing relationships between employers and employees and in ensuring its members have proper conditions of employment. Without trade unions, workers would not have the conditions that exist today and for which previous generations fought hard. I congratulate those involved in the movement on the excellent work they have done through the years.I also congratulate IBEC, which is a registered trade union, because it has played a significant role in educating and advising employers about proper industrial relations and in getting involved at the coalface in negotiations on behalf of businesses. Small businesses in particular do not have the personnel with the necessary skills to negotiate agreements and conditions of employment with trade unions. IBEC has played a significant role in facilitating relations between employers and employees.Voluntarism is the essence of our industrial relations system and, in certain circumstances, legislation must be introduced. A number of Bills were enacted in the 1970s in particular because of EU directives rather than the evolution of industrial relations in the State. These included the Equal Pay Act, which people said would destroy employment. One would be laughed at if one said that nowadays. However, it was strongly argued at the time that the Act would be detrimental to jobs in Ireland.When the Unfair Dismissals Bill 1977 was enacted, employers were appalled because they believed they would never again be able to discipline an employee. There was an overreaction to the provisions in these Acts but time has proven that they have facilitated relations between employers and employees in terms of resolving disputes in the areas they cover. However, most problems are resolved through mutual discussion and negotiation.My only concern is that, as a result of the various agreements that have been reached in recent years, including Sustaining Progress, both trade union and employer representatives have lost the skills to negotiate pay agreements. Inevitably, national pay agreements are part of a cycle and there will be a return to local bargaining. Trade unionists and employers will have a great deal to learn to obtain the skills to negotiate agreements on a workplace by workplace basis. I recall negotiating 12 month agreements with unions annually. Many skills were developed in each round of negotiations but national pay agreements have eliminated the need for them. The time will come, however, when they will again be needed.I was a human resources manager in the 1970s. When a case was taken to the employment appeals tribunal, IBEC and trade union representatives attended on behalf of the employer and the employee and both sides of the argument were made in an informal way. I was an IBEC nominee on the employment appeals tribunal for nine years and I witnessed negative changes during that period. Highly paid lawyers represented both sides in cases and their fees ran to thousands of pounds depending on the length of the case. The employment appeals process is now about legalities rather than settlements. We should return to the days where the trade union official and the IBEC representative negotiated at the tribunal because it is treated similar to a court nowadays. I never tolerated this because the tribunal is not a court. Sometimes, during cases lawyers referred to hearsay at which point I intervened and said I wanted to hear it.Industrial relations are about trying to settle disputes, not generating court cases, and it is a pity lawyers seek numerous hearings because it is unnecessary to engage lawyers. The IBEC and trade union representatives who sat on the tribunal with me had more understanding of the industrial and human relations involved because we all came from the same background and we could tune into the human aspects as well as the industrial relations aspects of the dispute between both parties. As a consequence, one was more likely to get to the truth and thereby reach a better decision than by listening to arguments about points of law and foolproof facts which lawyers like to outline. Industrial relations involve human relations as well as being a mechanism for formal dispute settlement.The Bill improves the position of workers who are not represented by trade unions. Everybody should have an opportunity to be represented but the world does not work like that. It is important that those who do not have the opportunity to be professionally represented should be able to avail of a mechanism whereby their views are heard and their disputes settled.I welcome the Bill and its provisions. I pay tribute to the staff of the Labour Relations Commission because they work hard to ensure disputes are resolved. They are extremely committed to their work. When I served on the employment appeals tribunal, they were concerned when disputes were not settled. They did not act like people who had a job to do because they felt they had a mission to ensure disputes were resolved.I recall the old days when rights commissioners traversed the State in helicopters and so on to ensure disputes were settled. During meetings, the commissioner would often take a toilet break. He would then isolate one group and ask them what they would accept to settle the dispute. He would then call the other group aside and ask the same question. The disputes were resolved in that way. One should compare that to the alternative of having two highly paid lawyers arguing the case for their respective clients. I would like to pay tribute to the body of people who worked in that area.A previous speaker referred to the position of people who are not and never will be represented, namely the poor and those who are not in employment. Those in employment have an opportunity, through the various means provided to improve their conditions of employment. However, the Government and the State have a duty towards those who are not in a position to improve their own conditions. We should listen very carefully to the voluntary groups which represent those people.We have recently had pre-budget submissions from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, CORI and others. Those bodies try to provide for the poor a service of the type which trade unions give their members, but without the power of the trade union movement. Government and Opposition have a duty to listen very closely to the message from what I might call the trade unions of the poor – the voluntary social service organisations. They have not got the mechanisms which we have set out in this Bill and cannot take their claim on behalf of the poor to a court in which they can argue it with the Government. They can make representations to the Government through meetings and otherwise, but ultimately they do not have the sanction available to trade unions – the withdrawal of labour.That very important sanction must be protected at all costs. People must retain the right to withdraw their labour if they are not happy with the approach of their employer. That right was originally enshrined in an Act of 1882 and confirmed in the 1906 Act and our more recent industrial relations legislation, without which I do not believe we would have made the progress we have made with regard to conditions of employment. My point is that the poor and those who speak for them do not have that sanction. For that reason, our responsibility is all the greater to listen to their claims.There is a great deal of concern about the level of competitiveness, to which the previous speaker referred. Jobs are being lost to the third world and eastern Europe because of cost conditions. Perhaps that is inevitable. However, we must ensure that young people are given the skills required for the future, not skills which are moving away.I am familiar with the experience in Limerick, including the work of the University of Limerick, previously the National Institute of Higher Education, to change the type of employment in that city. I recall a time when people from the Limerick area were employed at Shannon on menial, repetitive work on assembly lines in companies such as EI, which no longer exist. We have now moved to employment in areas of technical expertise and we must look beyond that for the future. We must consider what type of employment will be required five, ten or twenty years hence. The type of employment will change, because we are losing competitiveness in certain areas which I believe it will be difficult to recover.We must try to control costs. It is unrealistic to expect the return of those industries which are leaving this country. However, there are alternative possibilities if we have the vision to consider what the needs of employers will be in future years and ensure that our third level institutions, the colleges of technology and universities, provide the required qualifications and skills in that regard.What has attracted high-tech industries to Ireland is the knowledge and skills of our young graduates from third level institutions. That has been a key to our success, no less than our competitiveness with regard to costs of production. We must build on that success in terms of the skills, training and qualifications which are necessary today, but we must also consider what is necessary for tomorrow. While I do not have the answers in that regard, I believe there are people in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments who are capable of taking an overview of world developments in technology and the types of product likely to be demanded in future with a view to ensuring that we have the skills to develop, promote and market those products.Effective marketing and promotion are key aspects of ensuring our success in international markets. The three important areas for attention include research and development to find the right product, followed by its manufacture and marketing. We need to anticipate the needs of future generations, research and develop the right products, manufacture them and move them on. By providing the right ethos, we will attract companies from abroad. In looking to the future, the priorities for any company are to survive, develop and make as much profit as possible. Those who fail to look to the future will find that their products have become redundant. That happens even in the food sector, with companies going out of business as a result of failure to carry out research and development in a futuristic approach to their enterprises. The trade union movement, in all its aspects, also has a major part to play in this regard by looking ahead to the position of its members in ten, 20 or 30 years from now.I welcome the Bill and congratulate all involved, including those who participated in the negotiations on the Sustaining Progress agreement, for recognising that this type of approach is necessary to assist those who may not have the power of a strong trade union representation.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I do not know why the Government wastes time in bringing Bills such as this before the Dáil, on the pretence that we have a serious debate on serious industrial relations issues. This Bill is quite akin to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, which also took up a great deal of time. I tracked that Bill through Committee and Report Stages. It was pathetic legislation which was designed, as is this Bill, to avoid the central question of mandatory trade union recognition by employers when workers wish to join a union and to wipe the eyes of workers by pretending we have some kind of substitute in this case or in the case of the 2001 legislation.If the situation were not so serious, the 2001 legislation, which this Bill amends, would be laughable. It provided the most contorted procedures for workers and unions to follow when recalcitrant employers would not recognise the workers' fundamental human right to join a union to negotiate on their behalf. We had the ludicrous provision in that Bill whereby workers and their unions could chase employers through the Circuit Court and elsewhere, possibly for months or years after the employer had shut up shop and moved on. The procedures put in place were too complex and drawn-out.This is an attempt to avoid the central issue, namely, it should be an automatic right of workers to join a union and to have that union recognised by their employer. We need a trade union recognition Bill, not an excuse pretending to be one. These Bills can be traced back to the Ryanair dispute of 1998, when 40 baggage handlers joined SIPTU. They wanted SIPTU to negotiate their terms and conditions with Ryanair but the Minister's friend, Mr. O'Leary, refused to tolerate any trade union within the company and refused to negotiate. He victimised those workers in the most ruthless and brutal fashion, forced them to strike and created enormous problems in Dublin Airport. If anyone else had done that the Minister would have been on her feet denouncing the anarchists who had caused the trouble but we had no such denunciations from her at the time. The victimisation and pressure were so ruthless and obvious that even the Taoiseach referred at the time to an unacceptable capitalism that was red in tooth and claw when referring to the methods of Ryanair.Of course, by the time we arrived at the 2001 Act – and now the 2003 Bill – the question of trade union recognition had been watered down out of all recognition in comparison to what was before us in legislation. One only has to ask if the grievances of workers whose bosses will not allow their trade union of choice to negotiate for them would be resolved by these bits of legislation. Clearly they would not, and the proof is in the serious and intractable disputes going on as we speak, disputes which are intractable because of the position and attitude of management. For example, 52 employees of the Oxigen waste management company, mainly young workers, joined SIPTU and wanted that union to negotiate for them. For the last five weeks they have been out on strike and their employer refuses to accept the democratic decision those workers made.Another waste management company, Greenstar – which is owned by National Toll Roads – had 14 workers join a union. Again, they found themselves outside the gate when the company refused to take up a reasonable position and to accept that these workers have a right to be represented fully by a union of their choice. It is getting up to all kinds of tricks to put pressure on the workers to try to break the strike.What is really scandalous is that both of those companies are benefiting hugely from public funding. Oxigen has many contracts with local authorities in the Dublin area and perhaps beyond, collecting green bins with certain recyclable materials. It is incredible that public bodies should continue to deal with companies which refuse to recognise a civil right to join and be represented by a trade union. It is the same for National Toll Roads, which has been the beneficiary of huge concessions from public bodies and is in line for huge public contracts with the new toll roads the Government is building around the country. If the Government had any commitment to workers' rights there would be a clause that none of those companies could avail of any public funding while they refuse to recognise trade unions in their workplaces and refuse to negotiate with workers who join those unions. However, the Government is not committed to workers' rights.As is the case in many policy areas, the Government talks about rights but, in practice, it does not implement what it stands for. The Government, like the employers, pretends to stand for partnership, when partnership is a complete myth in practice. Partnership is the leaders of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions hob-nobbing with the leaders of IBEC and Ministers, arriving at deals behind closed doors and foisting those deals on a workforce which is largely kept out of the process, then saying "We're all the best of friends."The reality totally belies partnership. If we had a genuine partnership, workers would not be outside the gates of Oxigen and Greenstar because their bosses refuse to recognise trade unions. Not enough people are showing up the emperor's new clothes of partnership, something which needs to be done. The Minister cannot deny that the effect of partnership, since the first deals were worked out in 1987, was to secure a substantial transfer of wealth from working people to employers, the corporate sector, the landlord class and the financial sector. According the Central Statistics Office, figures from 1987 to the early 2000s on the sharing out of the national cake show categorically that over this period the so-called partnership has been used to restrain the wage increases due to workers while putting no restraints whatsoever on rent and profits. If one takes the housing sector alone, there has been a massive grab by speculators and big developers out of the pockets of young people attempting to buy their first home. Are these speculators the partners of the working people attempting to purchase a home? That is absolute nonsense.Unfortunately, we have a trade union leadership where those at the top are gutless, they do not stand up to Government and employers and they are satisfied to go along with excuses of legislation which pretend to be a concession to the right of workers to join a union, but they are no such thing. Is it any wonder that with the concessions made year after year by the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, employers are prepared to act like jackboot generals in the way they treat their workers.I hope the Minister does not trot out again the constitutional excuse for the Government not bringing in legislation to grant automatic trade union recognition to workers, which was done in the debate on the industrial relations (amendment) Act 2001. Incredibly, the Constitution is relied upon to refuse workers an automatic right to join a union arising from what became known as the Abbot and Whelan case. That argument is constantly trotted out. In 2001, the Minister of State used that argument against the demand by rank and file workers for their right to join a trade union and an automatic right to be represented by one. The judgment, which was never written down and went unreported, relies on Article 40 of the Constitution. It is inexplicable that articles of the Constitution, which refer to the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions, the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms and the right of citizens to form association and unions, is put up there as an excuse for not giving the right to workers to be automatically represented by a trade union.The Government should not bother coming in here with these excuses of flimsy industrial relations legislation in the future. When it is ready to bring in a genuine trade union recognition Bill, which would mean that a group of workers who decide to join a union would have an automatic right underpinned by law and that their employer must deal with such a union, it will be worth debating the issue.Deirtear go mbaineann an Bille seo le socrú breise agus feabhsaithe chun caidreamh comhchuí a chur chun cinn idir oibrithe agus fostaitheoirí.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I have no great objection to the Bill. It is necessary it is passed by the House in accordance with previous agreements and arrangements arising from partnership discussions and in particular the discussions on Sustaining Progress.I compliment the trade union movement and management on the responsible attitudes they have adopted to collective bargaining in recent years. This has been hailed as a great event and has been copied by others elsewhere throughout Europe and in many others parts of the world. While recognising the great benefit of the partnership agreements heretofore, if the Government does not keep its end of the bargain that creates problems, hence the need for legislation such as this to be introduced from time to time.My colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, with whom I have had disputes in the past, has pointed out a sore point which affects a great number of the new generation. At the central core of Sustaining Progress and previous agreements there would have been some indication to the workforce as to what they would have to contend with over the next two, three or four years, or whatever is the duration of a partnership agreement. The largest item of expenditure which any family has to face is the purchase of a house, yet there has been not only a doubling or trebling, but a quadrupling of the costs in terms of house prices imposed on a householder over the past five or six years. That is disgraceful. I cannot understand how any negotiators can say after an agreement has been reached that they are sorry about it and that it did not work out the way they thought it would. This is a clear case of the Government changing the goalposts after the agreement has been reached and then complaining when people start seeking higher wages. What else can they do if they cannot live as a result of being tied into an agreement which was based on conditions prevailing at that time.I do not know what is going wrong, but the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Joe Higgins and the two Ministers opposite must be aware that if costs go beyond the reach of people and cause a burden to be imposed upon them, there are two things they can do, they jobs can be moved out of the country – the relocation of jobs was discussed earlier – or they can seek higher wages, which will result in a further relocation of jobs, and they can still seek higher wages. The Minister has gone on record to say that it was not our intention to be a low wage economy. That is correct, but ours should be a competitive economy. Those two elements are interdependent. As we move away from competitiveness and into the higher wage bracket, which seems to be the direction in which we are going, that means the workforce has no more in their pockets than they had previously; they have less and there may be fewer of them in the workplace.Something has gone radically wrong with the way Government policy has been pursued in recent years, something on which we have not been able to get answers. It is all hinged around housing policy. The biggest single driver of the movement towards lack of competitiveness is higher house prices, to such an extent that there is no possibility of a young couple in their late 20s or early 30s buying a house. They will shortly be able to rent or lease a house for the same cost it would have taken to buy a house a few years ago, but they will only have it for five or six years. An extraordinary transformation has taken place which I cannot understand. The Government is obviously aware of it because it is the main beneficiary. Higher house prices means higher stamp duty returns to the Exchequer. This is the only area of the economy where revenue is growing rapidly. Expectations have been exceeded beyond all projections. The result is that fewer people will be in a position to own a house.I have a reasonable knowledge of how people react when they find themselves in the position where the stability that goes with house ownership is removed. They see something tangible for which they can work and live removed and their being given the headline goal of paying someone else's mortgage. With this, any pride and commitment to the economy is removed.It is a disgrace that it has been allowed to continue. There was no need for this. Countless artificial barriers were put in the path of people who ordinarily would have bought their own houses. Every obstruction possible was devised to slow down the housing sector. It has slowed to such an extent that Ministers now inform us that it was a good idea because these people have been housed and accommodated.This negative aspect of the economy relates to the Bill. The more we go in this direction, the greater the need for this type of legislation. In future, more industrial disputes will arise directly from the scenario to which Deputy Joe Higgins and others referred.There will always be disputes as to whether people should be excluded from joining a union or whether membership should be mandatory. There are differing views on this issue. It is important that we achieve some degree of balance regarding the degree to which the trade union movement can represent the workforce. If unions are eliminated from the equation, a haphazard situation of unofficial and lightning strikes will ensue with the result that the economy cannot be run, let alone an organisation or operation. It is a question of achieving the right balance and ensuring that the rights of the workforce are recognised.There is also an obligation on employers and management to manage properly. This may be at variance with the wishes of the trade union movement. However, the job of management is to manage their specific aspect of the economy. They should not abuse their position. In any case where management failed to manage, not only did they have to walk out the factory gates, so too did the workforce.It is important to remember that the introduction of this legislation appears to have been an afterthought or with the purpose of addressing issues that may arise. Issues do and will arise. As long as we have a Government – the main sponsors of the partnership process – that allows the goalposts to change mid-term, it will be necessary to amend for recovery in some way. It is the responsibility of the Government to take this on board.There is no better example of Government, partnership and trust than the previous general election. Management and the workforce of the country were informed that an agreement was imminent. They were given the clear impression that they could proceed on the basis of what was visible and on the negotiating table at the time. Scarcely had the ink dried on the ballot papers than the Government set about pulling rabbits out of hats at a rate of knots that set aside almost everything said to the electorate beforehand. The Government and management clearly had no intention of keeping the bargain they had entered into. They were determined to break it from the beginning and put forward proposals and suggestions of living up to it.Faced with this, people will have become cynical. It is not only the unions that have become cynical but also the electorate. When the electorate becomes so, there comes a change. When the time comes, the arbiters of right and wrong in a democracy – the electorate – will take its decision seriously. The failure to deliver the agreement put on the table by the Government before the election is a disgrace. While I do not wish to paraphrase a certain British politician, it must be said of the Government that, in the case of the previous general election, never was so much promised by so few to so many with such disastrous results.This issue goes far beyond affecting the trade union in the individual firm or the relations between it and management. It has extended into the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. We know how far the Government's commitments and indications given beforehand have been sustained. It now goes to the core of democracy. Those who entered the agreement or bargain at a certain time have seen it go up in smoke before their very eyes and have no way in changing it. They must wait until the next general election which could be in four years' time, assuming elections have not been abolished by then or replaced with some electronic means to get the opinion of the electorate. I hope that, from the past experiences of collective bargaining and partnership, all parties keep their sides of the bargain in the future, especially the Government.

The Bill now before this House has emanated from an agreed approach by both the trade union and employer organisations, under Sustaining Progress, to enhance the effectiveness of existing procedures for dealing with disputes where negotiating arrangements are not in place. I thank the trade union and employer organisations' representatives involved in the negotiation of this agreement. In particular, I acknowledge their achievement in reaching an agreed approach to enhancing existing provisions in the context of disputes where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place.In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness it was agreed that the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 and the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, which supports the 2001 legislation, would be monitored during the course of the programme. The outcome of this monitoring process has resulted in the Bill which is now before the House. In addition, we will have a new code of practice of voluntary dispute resolution and a code of practice on victimisation.The effect of the Bill and the codes of practice will essentially be to enhance and strengthen existing procedures with a view to processing cases within a specific timeframe and to introduce a prohibition on victimisation of employees who are members of a union, managers discharging their managerial functions and other employees in the context of a dispute, where the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or is intended to be invoked.On behalf of the Minister, I welcome the general support expressed by Deputies for the Bill. Deputies have raised important points during the course of this debate. I would now like to respond to a number of the points made.A number of Deputies have raised the issue of statutory trade union recognition. Traditionally, our industrial relations legislation has been designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on parties to an industrial dispute.The recommendations in the report of the high level group, which laid the foundations for the 2001 Act, affirmed the consensus that exists to maintain voluntarism as the preferred approach to dispute resolution. In the negotiations on the national agreement, Sustaining Progress, trade union and employer representatives re-affirmed their agreement to this approach. The Bill before the House reflects their preferred option of continuing our tradition of volunteerism. It is not the Government's policy to impose legislation in the industrial relations arena where parties are prepared to work together towards achieving progress in this area.Deputy Howlin raised the Government's position on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This charter was proclaimed as a political declaration at the Nice European Council in December 2000. At that time, the question of whether its status was legally binding or otherwise was left to one side. Part of the mandate of the Convention on the Future of Europe was to consider incorporating it into a new constitutional treaty, thereby giving it legal status. Accordingly, the convention established a working group to look at this question. The outcome of its work formed part of the report of the convention, which is currently being considered by the Intergovernmental Conference. Among the subjects under discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference is the Charter of Fundamental Rights.A number of Deputies raised the ongoing dispute in Oxigen. This case involves a trade union recognition claim by SIPTU members and pickets have been in place at three company depots since 14 October. Most trade union recognition disputes have their origins in concerns about pay and other conditions of employment. This Bill would allow issues on pay and conditions to be investigated by the Labour Court within a specific timeframe.Deputy Hogan sought details on the number of cases processed under the current code of practice on dispute resolution. To date, 96 cases have been referred to the Labour Relations Commission. Of these cases, 11 have been successfully resolved by the commission, nine cases were withdrawn, five were referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal or to the conciliation service of the Labour Relations Commission, 18 cases were referred to the Labour Court under the 2001 Act, a further ten were referred to the Labour Court by the Labour Relations Commission under legislation other than the Act of 2001 and 18 cases are the subject of on-going discussions in the Labour Relations Commission.The remaining cases are at different stages in the process. Some are on hold. In other cases the trade union or employer refused or failed to respond and in seven cases the procedures under the code of practice were exhausted without agreement being achieved and the trade union or excepted body could not avail of the Act of 2001, as the conditions set out in section 2(1) had not been satisfied.Deputies Hogan and Connaughton sought clarification on the code of practice on victimisation. This code of practice is currently being developed by the Labour Relations Commission, in consultation with trade union and employer representatives. The code of practice on victimisation will only be applicable in instances where the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution has been invoked or is intended to be invoked.The legislation in conjunction with the codes of practice will result in more effective and efficient procedures in the dispute resolution arena and will contribute to greater stability in the field of industrial relations. On behalf of the Minister, I again thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate in a positive and constructive manner. I hope the remaining Stages of this Bill can be swiftly progressed through this House on the basis of all-party support.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Last week when I spoke on this Bill I mentioned a number of points, one of which related to the restrictive nature of chronological age specified in the Bill, which will only apply to persons not more than 18 years of age. As I am sure the Minister is aware, many people with a disability start school at a later age and in many cases their development takes longer. While it is difficult, chronological age may not be the most appropriate measure and I ask the Minister to reconsider this. On reaching the age of 18 and having rightfully had special support, a child with a special educational need will now have to reconsider his or her position and may have to leave the school even though he or she might not be ready to leave.I also spoke about the advocacy need of parents. In many other countries an advocacy service is established in conjunction with legislation such as this so that parents can have access to professional support when meeting psychologists, principals and so on, which can be intimidating. That is something the Minister should look at and try to include in the Bill. This came up regularly at the committee hearings. Many of the groups were looking for this and I believe it is useful.While pre-school is considered the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children, it is an area that needs to be looked at because the greatest impact will be achieved at the earliest point of intervention. It is something that needs to be fleshed out and clarified.I spoke last week about the extra pressure on principals as a result of this legislation. Principals are concerned about their increasing workload. We have had the Education Act and the Education (Welfare) Act. Now there is this Education for Persons With Disabilities Bill 2003. They are all welcome and necessary, but the workload on principals is enormous. In some instances schools find it difficult to recruit principals and people are shying away from the role. Perhaps the Minister will have a look at that in the context of this Bill to see how he can give principals more support. I know the special education needs officers, SENOs, will be there to help. We need to look at the relationship between SENOs, principals and schools to see how some of this pressure may be alleviated.At the heart of the Bill is the problem of definition and the issue of disability. Perhaps we need to move on and not use the word "disability". We should look at the educational need of children and students. The title, Education for Persons With Disabilities Bill 2003, assumes that people with disabilities have educational needs that are different from others, and not all of them have. Not everyone with a disability has a special educational need. The Minister might consider changing the title and therefore the whole thrust of the Bill and instead call it the education for persons with special needs Bill 2003. To concentrate on the needs rather than the disability of the students would change the whole focus of the Bill. It would also mean other changes. The definition of a "child with special educational needs" is a child who has an educational disability. That is clumsy, flawed and dangerous. If we change the way of thinking about special needs, all the definitions must be altered to take account of that."Educational disability" in relation to a child is defined as a restriction in his or her capacity to participate in and benefit from education on account of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment. I have a problem with the two words "enduring" and "impairment". I realise that we should, perhaps, be debating this on Committee Stage rather than now, but this is crucial to the overall underpinning and philosophy of this Bill. The use of "impairment" is outdated terminology, and I respectfully suggest the Minister removes it and replaces it with "educational difficulties of an exceptional nature" or something to that effect. A person may have a physical impairment, but it is not possible to say that someone with an intellectual disability has an impairment. I do not think one can say that, as such, because the continuum is profound in its scope. It is insulting to say to someone, "You are impaired". To have a need and to present that as being impaired is a misuse of language, and that needs to be changed because it is basically flawed.There is the term "integrated education" in section 2. That is used as the heading, but it is not used in the section. The section states: "The provision of education to a child with special educational needs shall take place alongside the provision. . . . "  I do not know what "alongside" means and would prefer to see the term "inclusive education" used. That would be more respectful. If that term was used, the wording of the section would need to be looked at. The word "alongside" implies separateness. The child is in the classroom, maybe, but "alongside" is a term that should be avoided.Section 2(b) refers to an issue with which many colleagues have difficulty. It states: “the effective provision of education for children with whom the child is to be educated.”  That means that if children who have not got special educational needs are to be affected in some way by being in the same classroom, it is the child with the special educational needs who has to be removed. The Bill does not say who is to take that decision. It does not specify how it is to be done or what is to happen to the child with a special educational need. That is open to all sorts of challenges and difficulties. Principals and teachers will have different levels of tolerance, and support. In one school the teacher might appeal to the principal on the grounds that a child with special educational needs is seen to be affecting the education of the other children while in another school that might not happen.That section should be considered by the Minister because we are again treating the child with a special educational need as the victim. In effect, we are saying not just that the child has a problem, but that he or she is the problem. I said last week we should get away from the idea that the person with disability has a problem, or is a problem. That is fundamental to disability legislation. Such thinking is out of date, and it is worrying to find it implicitly in this Bill. Thinking of this kind needs to be brought up to date by all of us when dealing with this legislation.Section 5(1)(b)(i) refers to “a psychologist”, but there is no definition of psychologist. There are all kinds of psychologists, industrial, educational, clinical psychologists and so on. We are talking about children with special educational needs and the psychologist referred to should have knowledge and experience of children with special educational needs as well as training in that area. We need to define “psychologist” so that it is clear that a qualification in special needs education is necessary.Section 5(1)(b)(v) refers to “a therapist who is suitably qualified to provide support services in respect of a child.”  I suggest we should insert “in respect of the needs of a child” rather than “in respect of a child”. Once again it is necessary to focus on the needs of the child. The provision indicates that the child is the problem, and we need to get away from that.Section 4(6) states "An assessment for the purposes of this section shall include an evaluation and statement of the nature and extent of the child's disability". Why do we need that? Surely it is the needs of the child that should be focused on, rather than insisting that the child is or has a problem, and writing it down. The needs and resources must be focused on there.Section 5(4) states: "An assessment under section 3 or 4 shall be carried out in a manner which conforms to such standards as may from time to time be determined by a prescribed body”. What is the prescribed body? I assume the reference is to the Psychological Society of Ireland but I do not know. This needs to be fleshed out. The subsection continues: “that is to say, a body standing prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for Health and Children for the purposes of its determining the standards that assessments under those sections must conform to.”  Again, we need to know a little more about what that is.Section 19 refers to membership of the national council for special education. The council is a welcome development. The Bill states that the council shall consist of a specified number of people. Before making appointments to the council, the Minister will, laudably, consult national associations of parents, which I welcome, trade unions, staff associations representing teachers and principals, and recognised school management associations. It strikes me as odd that the Minister is not required to consult anybody who has expertise in this area. There is no requirement to consult the Psychological Society of Ireland, speech therapists, occupational therapists or other people who may have expertise in the area. The Minister should take this into account and amend the Bill.Section 20 refers to the consultative forum, which is welcome. It is a good idea. Section 20(4)(f) refers to “such other persons having a special interest in or knowledge relating to the education of children with disabilities as the Council considers appropriate.”  That is somewhat vague and could be firmed up. The Minister should re-examine this paragraph.Much reference has been made to the educational needs of children, which is what the Bill should address rather than disabilities, as such. I thank the Minister for his reply to a parliamentary question which I submitted to him on this matter. He clarified that children with problems resulting from dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD, ADHD and so on would be covered by the legislation. I welcome this and urge the Minister to ensure it will happen. It should be explicitly stated in the legislation. Changing the thrust of the Bill to focus on need rather than disability would benefit children with dyslexia or other learning difficulty.The qualification of teachers working with children with special educational needs is an issue of concern which the proposed legislation should address. This is similar to the definition of a psychologist. Almost anybody can say that he or she is a teacher.I welcome the Bill and look forward to the Committee Stage debate. I again congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward. It is important legislation which will affect children with special needs and their parents. All of us in the House want to do the best we can for these children. With the Fine Gael Party, I will work as hard as I can to ensure that the best possible legislation will emerge at the end of the process.
#LizODonnell	unknown-#LizODonnell-party	unknown-#LizODonnell-dob	unknown-#LizODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Bill is a progressive development for equality of opportunity, services and esteem. It aims to develop an education system which gives children with disabilities the same opportunity for personal development through education as is given to those without disabilities.While none of us would claim that the Bill heralds the end of the journey for equality of service provision, we should celebrate it and recognise it as a real advance in terms of valuing and including people with disabilities and special educational needs in our education system, as of right, for the first time on a statutory basis. This advance, which will be built on and developed, is now irreversible.There is a clear consensus that we must harness and maximise the opportunities for those with disabilities or special educational needs. This consensus has been building for some time. We have arrived at this stage due to the work of many people – parents, teachers and non-governmental organisations working in this sector which have been strong advocates and persuaders on behalf of these children for many years.I pay tribute to Angela Kerins, among others, chairwoman of the National Disability Authority, which ably and fairly managed the disability legislation consultation group which received input from eight different NGOs. This legislation honours the principles adopted by the disability legislation consultation group.Last June the Special Olympics captured a moment in time when the societal consensus about opportunity for people with disabilities was crystallised. It was not just a passing moment of sentiment or sympathy, it was a time when the ability, opportunity, achievement and talent of people with disabilities was demonstrated and celebrated by all. The Special Olympics raised our consciousness about the diversity of ability of people with disabilities. The lasting value of the games for us as policy makers and as a society will be in translating that raised awareness and societal consensus into a new normality.The job now is to put in place permanent and sustainable ways of organising ourselves to fully reflect the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities, such as the legislative framework, health and education services and the small but pivotal details of physical infrastructure.The Bill is a building block in this programme of detailed work. We are down to the practical realities of rights, services and redress. I regret it has taken so long to build consensus and bring forward this legislation. We could have acted faster. The Minister deserves credit for his part in progressing to this stage. I regret some of the false dichotomies that have been raised in the theoretical, and at times highly politicised, public argument about a rights-based approach to disabilities legislation.I support the emphasis on rights for people with disabilities and the way the disability legislation consultation group treated the issue. It is an important way of achieving the sustainable services and social infrastructure we want as a society. Rights involve a principled basis for equality and justice and they only make sense in that context. They do not make sense if they entail superior rights, special rights or discriminatory rights. Rights make sense only if they work and can be validated. We are moving beyond theoretical discussions of rights to practical solutions about the delivery of services. To claim, as some do, that it is a simple and absolute choice between charity or rights does little for practical progress in public policy.Creating a sense of tension and fundamentalism that this Bill or the disability Bill that is to come must be judged as either win it all or lose it all badly serves people with disabilities and their families. Reasonable people know that it is seldom a matter of all or nothing, black and white, in regard to social and economic rights and services. False choices are being presented and flawed positions are being taken.Some people are afraid of what lies beyond the present day boundaries of economic and social rights. Others claim we can operate in a world with no limitations on resources and services. Both of these positions are flawed. Is it not more the case that we strive to do our best in a world of limitations and push out the boundaries as far as we can each time? This is the only way to achieve practical progress. From our experience of overseas aid, we know that to argue solely in terms of charity and rights gets us nowhere. We could simply declare that there is a right in poor countries to clean water, food and good government, but who would implement these rights, how would they do it and what resources would they use?The human right to development is meaningless without long-term sustainable aid programmes in poor countries. Everyone who wants to make a difference in human development in the poorest countries realises that we need specific, well-managed projects to make progress. Without such projects, the promise of a right to development would bring rights themselves into disrepute. We make rights real by applying practical solutions in the real world.In that context, the Bill represents a significant advance in the vindication of constitutional rights in the education field for people with learning problems and disabilities. It is the largest step forward for many years and it will serve people with disabilities well for years to come.The Bill will make special needs education a right-enforceable in law. It complements the Constitution which provides that each child is entitled to free primary education which the State has a duty to provide. In future, the State will also have a duty to ensure that each child receives at least a minimum education. The Bill establishes the National Council for Special Education as a new service provision structure. Central to the legislative provisions is the role of parents.The Bill sets out a range of services which must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans and support services. It also provides for an appeals process, which will include mediation, in cases where needs are not being met. The system of appeal is intended to give parents a quicker, cheaper and more effective route to remedying deficiencies in their child's education. The new system will not prevent parents seeking and obtaining the protection of the courts to ensure the provisions outlined in the legislation are implemented for their child. No existing or future legal avenue to redress is being blocked off, but new rights are being created.I emphasise the importance in the Bill of the specific timeframes for actions by all relevant players. These include schools, the National Council for Special Education and the appeals board. This provision will ensure that parents see clarity and predictability in the process to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities.Many parents whose children experience chronic difficulties in their educational development have struggled alone for too long to negotiate help for their children. They have gone from initial assessment and resource allocation to unmet needs and the despair of witnessing the loss of precious educational time as the system failed to deliver for their child. These parents will rejoice that at long last the State is addressing their plight. Too many children have been let down by the education service. They have slipped through the system and opted out of education.Since 1997, there has been a major injection of resources. The number of special resource teachers catering for children in ordinary schools increased from 104 to 2,300. The number of special needs assistants has grown from fewer than 300 to 5,500 full and part-time positions. The number of learning support teachers in primary schools has grown from 1,242 in 1997 to 1,531 today.Significant efforts have been made and substantial resources have been provided in a sector in which there was always a feeling that there was a disconnection and a lack of co-ordination of services. The Bill places the programme which meets the educational needs of children with special needs on a new statutory basis. The Minister will accept that it is fundamentally dependent on money. It will be very expensive and it will depend on resources.In particular, the implementation of education plans on an individual basis will require considerable resources. It will also place considerable and specified responsibilities on school principals. Deputy Stanton referred to this issue. I accept that the provisions of the Bill will add to principals' already considerable workloads but needs will have to be assessed, goals decided upon and progress monitored within a specified timeframe. It is useful and encouraging for parents to be sure that such specified timeframes are in place. I welcome the element of accountability at school level in terms of co-ordinating the education plan for a child. The Bill properly provides for strict time limits in respect of plans. Too many parents have experienced slippage in responses from schools to their children's educational needs and problems.Section 12 creates a statutory obligation on the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science to make resources available in recognition of the constitutional rights involved. I support the legislation because it pushes out the boundaries of rights and education services for people with disabilities. It fulfils the commitments outlined in the programme for Government to independent assessment, appeals and redress mechanisms in education services.As the Minister stated, education is a uniquely powerful tool in liberating people's talents. The Bill will ensure that people with learning problems arising from a disability will not be excluded from the wonderful opportunities education provides. The education system has rightly been credited with unleashing talents and leading to unprecedented economic development over the past 15 years. The time has come to facilitate opportunities and remove barriers to educational services for people with disabilities. Sadly, many children have not had the benefit of the Bill's provisions and have not realised their human potential. It must be accepted that it has taken too long to bring forward legislation of this nature.Failures to make educational interventions can have terrible results for individuals. The child who is not assessed early enough will fail to make critical developments in speech learning and development. Time is of the essence in these interventions. Many parents have despaired as time has passed. They alone as parents knew that their child's needs were not being met as service provision was postponed.Unfortunately, many parents have been forced into the courts to vindicate their children's rights and that should not have been necessary. Their constitutional rights were clear and the money spent by parents and, futilely, the State to bring and defend these court actions should have been employed to improve services across the board. Thankfully, this approach is now being pursued by the Government. Instead of the appalling and unconscionable situation of parents of people with disabilities pursuing and vindicating rights through the courts, the services they require are being put in place.Some questions arise about the division of responsibilities among health boards and Department of Education and Science to meet special needs among pre-school children. Early intervention and assessment is vital. It is at this early stage that parents need the most help and support in their interface with the State. Parenting a child with special needs is traumatic enough for a couple without the added burden of fighting terrible bureaucratic battles with the authorities. The burden must shift to the State to vindicate a child's rights as outlined in the Bill. It is in this key area of the shift of burdens to the State from what are in many cases exhausted parents that the effectiveness of the Bill will be judged. It is the job of Members on all sides as legislators to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are delivered.There is only a small window of opportunity in the education of a child with a learning difficulty or special needs. If mistakes are made or opportunities are missed at critical junctures in a child's development, it can have life altering effects on the individual. Many hundreds of children have been expelled, suspended and, as we know to our shame, brutalised because of learning difficulties which resulted in behavioural problems. We are having to deal with the people involved who are now adults. Their problems stem from the failure to provide for and meet the needs of children with learning problems at a certain time.The subject of behavioural problems requires serious consideration by schools, the Minister and the Department. Policy makers and parents know from personal experience that boys in particular experience educational difficulties. More boys than girls fall out of the system because of behavioural or educational learning problems. I hope the Bill will provide a structure in which to address the broad issue of educating boys in a manner which protects their emotional lives. The high rate of suicide among adolescent males in particular must be addressed. I can think of no more appropriate way in which to do that than through the education system.The Bill will provide a new structure and context in which we can examine, analyse and make interventions in the case of children who have difficulties in school, which they need to have addressed in a structured, organised and timely manner.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I welcome the Bill, particularly the statutory framework within which the rights of children with special educational needs are to be acknowledged and provision made for them. I hope the aspiration of a more structured and co-ordinated approach outlined in the Bill will be achieved. The Bill has substantial implications for current practices and procedures within schools and the sphere of interagency co-operation, particularly in the areas of role definition, responsibility and workload.The INTO and other teachers' organisations have a number of reservations about clear definitions of professional roles, the practical operation of the Bill at school level and ensuring that education and not bureaucracy becomes the overriding priority in regard to children with special educational needs, all of which I share. I am concerned that the definition of "disability" contained in the Bill is different from that contained in the Education Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000, which point has been highlighted by other speakers. However, the Minister has assured us that there will be no exclusion. Nevertheless, it is important the definition is clear in this Bill, which I hope will be corrected on Committee Stage.In particular, I am concerned that the definition in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill may be used to exclude some persons from the remit of the Bill, particularly people with specific learning needs and those suffering from conditions affecting emotions, which may result in disturbed behaviour, such as attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is important these conditions be included in the definition. More and more emotional and behavioural disabilities have appeared in our system, due to family breakdown and other circumstances in the home, with the result that children are experiencing more complex problems. The emotional and behavioural needs of young people have changed considerably, particularly those with special needs, because they need special attention. The Minister should consider the definition of "disability" used in the Education for Persons with Disability Bill 2002, the Education Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 for use in this Bill.I welcome the concept of integrated education, which Deputy Stanton argued should be renamed "inclusive education", where the necessary resources are in place to meet the needs of the child and class size is reduced accordingly. The Minister must agree that class sizes must be reduced and resources provided in regard to integrated education if the aspiration is to become a reality. I welcome the statement in the Bill which balances the rights of the child with a disability and the rights of the children with whom that child is to be educated.In the context of education plans, section 8 of the Bill contains a welcome focus on the abilities of the child. However, if these plans are to increase access to participation in the wider curriculum for children with special educational needs, there is a need for clear agreed guidelines and teacher education on the drawing-up and implementation of such plans; a clear definition of the roles of participants in the process; a collaborative approach as part of the school plan; clearly defined time for planning and review; teaching and learning which do not focus on splinter skills in isolation from wider circumstances; and, most importantly, adequate resources. The recent Education and Youth Work Acts, which were passed by the Oireachtas, have become less effective because no resources were provided. If this Bill is to be effective, such resources must be provided.There are also professional concerns about the Bill because it places considerable onus on all teachers, particularly principals, in regard to planning for the needs of children with disabilities. The vast majority of primary school principals also have full-time class teaching responsibilities. If further responsibility is to be placed on them in regard to children with special needs, teaching principals will require further release time and other support structures to enable them to carry out these tasks. This is common sense.Another concern of teachers is that, having gone through a detailed process of consultation and preparation of an education plan, the parent has the right of appeal against the contents but the principal and staff do not. Another issue of serious concern for teachers is the mechanism for a preview of the education plan. Section 10(1) states that the principal shall review, or cause to be reviewed, at regular intervals, but in any case not less than once a year, the operation of each education plan. However, under section 11(4), if parents have reason to believe their child is not achieving the goals specified in the education plan and a review of the plan has not occurred in the previous six months, they may request the principal to do so. If the principal decides not to do so, the parents have the right of appeal to the special education council. The council then has the power to direct the principal to carry out such a review.Aside from the contradiction in timescale inherent within these provisions, this also has considerable implications for the amount of school time which would be taken up in a constant series of reviews of plans. There are more than 2,300 resource teachers within the mainstream system as well as the number of special schools and classes. Therefore, the bureaucratic implications of teachers being constantly taken up with appeals and reviews has the potential to cause chaos within the system and divert attention away from the very worthy aims of providing the best possible education for children with special needs. I ask the Minister to address this matter in his reply.The inclusion of section 5(3), which allows the health board or the council to appeal if the parents of a child will not consent to assessment, is welcome. This brings the procedure closer in line with the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and has been welcomed by all Deputies and I welcome it too. The proper implementation of the provisions of this Bill will require considerable investment in immediate and ongoing professional development for all involved to ensure that the plans and procedures outlined in the legislation will be implemented properly. The emphasis has been put on physical resources but the investment in human and professional resources is equally important. There will be a major need for inservice courses and introductions to professionals who will become involved in special needs.The proposals in this Bill will require a great deal of co-operation within schools and between schools and various agencies. A key aspect of ensuring that the needs of children with special educational needs are met, will involve the role of the special educational needs organiser. There is considerable power and latitude given to the special educational needs organiser within the Bill. It is most important that there is a clear role definition and set of operating procedures and practices in place to avoid any misunderstandings or conflict in this regard.In view of the difficulties which have occurred in the recruitment and deployment of education welfare officers, it is important that proper procedures for the recruitment and deployment of special educational needs organisers are laid down. It may also help if the special educational needs organisers come from a teaching background, although not necessarily so, in view of the role envisaged in the Bill.The Bill has considerable implications for the workload of all teachers, in particular principal teachers, regarding the policies and provisions for special educational needs. In the case of teaching principals, considerable further release time needs to be made available to allow them to carry out administrative duties. The point at which an administrative principal post is created in a school also needs to be revised downwards.I welcome the inclusion of the paragraph in the Bill which confirms that the school will be provided with the necessary moneys and support services in order to prepare and implement the education plans. However, there is concern that the section in the previous Bill which stated that the Minister should provide resources "as are necessary" has been weakened to "resources as are determined by the Minister."The concept of a designated school, which a child with special needs should attend, must be dependent on the appropriate resources being available in that school. A weighted system where each school has special education support available before the child enrols would best enable schools to meet these needs.Considerable secretarial and other support will be required in order to ensure that all plans are developed, updated and reviewed as appropriate. Given the emphasis in the Bill on the issue of integration, there will also be capital costs associated with both buildings and equipment in order to ensure proper provision for children with special educational needs. On implementation of this Bill, proper consultation, negotiation and agreement on a partnership basis must take place. It is clear that without proper planning and resources, the worthy aims and aspirations for the education of children with special needs will not be achieved.I wish to make a few general points concerning integrated or inclusive education. From my experience of working with special needs children some years ago, I found that children with special needs can work comfortably with children in mainstream education, particularly in the areas of art and physical education. They learn a lot from them, considerably improve their self-esteem and build up good friendships.The Nano Nagle school in Listowel is a good example of integration. It was built on the same site as the primary convent school but while both schools share the site, the building is divided. A similar provision could be made in other parts of the country. I recommend that the successful planning used in that school be used as a prototype in other parts of the country. However, another example of what is happening in the school is not so successful. On Tuesday, I raised a matter on the Adjournment regarding provision for autistic children in the school. While the classroom assistants, a special teacher and equipment were all available, there was no room available in which to carry out the teaching. They were based in a portacabin at the rear of the school. Unless physical resources are provided along with the human resources, learning cannot take place. The group was moved from the portacabin into the school canteen but this deprived seven classes and 66 children of the opportunity to use the canteen. This confirms that without the physical and human resources this Bill will not work.The Nano Nagle school also has a class for severe and profound special needs. This is conducted in the other prefab at the rear of the building. I pointed out on Tuesday that three of that class must be tube fed and two of the children suffer from severe epilepsy. One child suffers from seizures which can last up to 15 minutes. They are in such a small congested area that although they have the equipment, there could be fatal consequences to this type of seizure on account of the lack of space. While I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that we have made a lot of progress, we still have a long way to go.I have been reading some of the comments of various interest groups. In a recent article in The Irish Times the general secretary of the INTO, Mr. John Carr, said that the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, “isn't worth the paper it is written on without a cast-iron guarantee of resources”. He also expressed dismay that the original Bill has been weakened substantially and is likely not to include children with specific learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. He said that the original Bill committed the Minister to, “providing such resources as are necessary,” but it has been altered to, “providing resources as are determined by the Minister”. The INTO also believes that without a definition of “disability” in the Bill, children with disabilities such as dyslexia and conditions affecting behaviour and emotional development will not be included. I think the Minister will guarantee us that this is not the case.The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals has also expressed concern that at second level, children with special needs were not being given the resources they required, thereby placing pressure on the resources of entire schools. The outgoing president of the association said at the annual conference that it would be little short of cynical on the part of the Government to enact the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill when schools quite obviously do not have the resources to implement it.Earlier this month, a national representative body for people with intellectual disability, NAMHI, said it feared that a recent audit of special needs resources, undertaken by the Department, would result in cuts in special needs assistance to children in primary and secondary schools across the country.One group particularly outraged by the current definition of special needs is the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. This is a countrywide group made up of families, teachers and adults with dyslexia. As the Minister knows, dyslexia is not a physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment. It is a specific learning disability, independent of intellectual or physical ability. Dyslexia is not an intellectual impairment, but it can be a disabling condition in the learning situation and children with dyslexia can, and often do, have special educational needs. This was recognised by the report of the task force on dyslexia. The organisation representing people affected by dyslexia is very concerned about the Bill and has met the Minister. I ask him to take their concerns on board.Down's Syndrome Ireland is also concerned that the proposed Bill is seriously flawed and does not fully address the minimum requirements of those with disabilities and their families. It is further concerned that the new proposed legislation contains similar provisions to the Disability Bill published before the end of 2001. Down's Syndrome Ireland has already called on the Government to introduce rights-based rather than resource-constrained legislation and to hold a full consultation process.I welcome this important Bill. As somebody who worked with children with special needs in the past and continues to have an active interest in this area, this is an important development. I emphasise that despite the resources provided in existing special schools, there are still major deficiencies in areas of special needs, especially in ones like autism. This will only be effective if the resources are provided and the Minister recognises that.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Like speakers on all sides of the Houses, I also welcome the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. The Joint Committee on Education and Science invited submissions and received a total of 53, and subsequently representatives of about 40 groups came to oral hearings with the committee. There were several striking aspects about the exercise, the first of which was that there were so many individuals and groups with a deep interest in the subject and in the Bill. There was also the fact that in several specific areas there was more than one group and they were not always quite in one voice regarding what they required of the Bill or of the subsequent service from the Department of Education and Science.This operation in committee took place during the summer recess and, as is normal, did not merit a mention anywhere in the media, which was not surprising. In spite of that, it is a useful exercise in the democratic process to have committees allow people with a specific interest in an area under discussion, in legislation or in policy, to come in and have their say. The members of the committee were unanimously of the view that it was enormously helpful for these people to present their views, and that was one part of the exercise. The next part was that the committee decided to prepare a large report, arising from all the submissions, which was sent on to the Minister and other interested parties.We would need a little more from the exercise. The committee members want to see some of the proposals of various interest groups acted on and accepted in the form of amendments. To be fair, it is very difficult to say specifically which ones because in quite a few instances the groups were not quite agreed on whether various things needed to change or whether they were good or bad. By and large, however, there were some pointers going through what was said in those presentations and I was delighted to hear the Minister, on the opening of the debate on Second Stage, indicate that he remains open to the views of people with an interest and that he will be prepared to accept amendments when this business returns to the committee on Committee Stage. I commend the members of the committee for the enormous amount of work they put in to wading through all these submissions and entering into a debate with the bodies who came before the committee.While one of the most striking features of the submissions was that in some cases there was some disagreement between people who had common ground, perhaps the other was the wide range of disabilities mentioned and represented by the views of those who came before the committee. It certainly brought home to me the difficulty of designing a "one size fits all" response, in terms of either legislation or service delivery. People will have been very impressed by the parents of children with profound disabilities and clearly for many of them the only adequate provision is in a non-classroom situation. It is certainly not within the confines of the ordinary school year because it is not possible for families to look after these children at home for very long periods.There were the various other disabilities along the line. Then one came to areas such as dyslexia, which is a learning disability and in some respects quite different from some of what is provided for in the Bill, but which nevertheless is a significant difficulty for those at the higher end of the range in particular. It also poses enormous difficulties for their parents. While there would not always be an intellectual disability accompanying the learning disability, the problem for schools and parents is to find a way to enable people with dyslexia, for example, or dyspraxia or any of a number of conditions, to fulfil and reach their potential. It is a significant challenge for individual schools and for the education system and this Bill goes a considerable way towards addressing it.There were also a number of groups dealing with people with autism. Even within that range, there are people who are quite profoundly affected, some considerably less so, and in the past four or five years there has been enormous improvement in the level of provision for them. We need to accept, however, that in this area we are to some extent on a learning curve and are finding that procedures and exercises which are successful in some cases are not successful in others. We will need to be flexible in the aims of the individual education plan and, perhaps more particularly, in carrying out assessments as to what progress is being made with each individual. That is quite well provided for in the Bill and some of the potential difficulties have been pointed out earlier and on the last occasion.It was probably my fault, but one group we forgot to invite to make a submission was that which deals with children, and indeed adults, with acquired brain injury. Due to road and other accidents, the number of people in that category has increased very dramatically, and is increasing incrementally very quickly. It is a significant difficulty for families because people who have been progressing normally through school and have the trauma of an accident, are frequently hospitalised for several months and then come back into the family home a very different person. If such people are in a position to return to their original school, they clearly present as quite different pupils and the kind of provision that needs to be made for them varies. This will depend on the extent of any disability visited on them and on their capacity to move forward, particularly given the difficulty that they would have been used to having many abilities which they may no longer have. It is one of the areas where we need to do an enormous amount of work. The framework of the Bill is probably sufficient to provide the kind of service required, but sometimes it is not adverted to quickly enough and there is no ready mechanism to bring these people, who previously operated at a particular level, into the system at the new level at which they unfortunately must operate.The committee also received interesting submissions from associations representing the deaf. They have a totally different requirement which, to be fair, to some extent can be dealt with under the Bill, though I personally believe that provision for deaf and blind people might well require an entirely separate section in the Bill. It is difficult to tie down what is required for people who do not have an intellectual impairment but are either blind or deaf, and there are very specific requirements to enable them to lead fulfilling lives to the extent they are able. That was one of the interesting aspects which came out of the submissions from the various people who have an interest in that area.We also heard the views of the teaching bodies, of the principals and of management. To some extent they would have concentrated on the resource issue but also, quite properly, on a new range of responsibilities which are visited on principals in particular. I confess that I have a particular sympathy for principals in this instance as I was one for nearly 20 years. I know how readily we visit many of the ills and the requirements of society on schools and how quickly and unthinkingly we say "the schools should be doing that". On this occasion the schools should be doing this but they cannot do it without the legislative framework. This is a useful framework but as other speakers, and the principals' and teachers' bodies said, it requires resources. This is a critical step in moving towards having resources.Section 3 outlines the role of the principal quite well. It is a burdensome job and there is a very good case for transferring some of the work to the special needs organiser. There is also a good case for outlining and supporting the role of the individual class teacher in the legislation, which the Minister could usefully do.We also had a very good presentation from parents' associations and one of the most lively debates in the committee about the perceived clash or contest between the needs of the special needs child and those of the other people in the classroom. In general this can be positive but in specific cases difficulties emerge which have to be addressed. The Bill goes some way towards providing the framework to do that. I will not make a specific proposal on it but it would be useful to consider how it might be improved. The Constitution, the Equal Status Act 2000 and the Education Act 1998 require equal treatment, but this Bill goes far beyond those two Acts in creating real rights for people in education and the means to address and advance them.Several groups made the case that the definition in this Bill is different – speakers today and the previous day also made this case. There are arguments as to why this might be so but there is a case for establishing some common ground with the definitions. I was very impressed by Deputy Stanton's approach to marking the emphasis on how one provides for people with special needs. It is a very good case and in ten, 15 or 20 years' time the kind of approach which the Deputy advocates will be seen as more enlightened and all-encompassing than that which we adopt at present. I hope that will be considered.It is difficult, and sometimes we neglect, to assess the progress being made in the area of educational plans and goals. The Bill provides particularly well for this and the formula will become accepted as the norm, but in those cases where it is not it would be better, if it were possible, to have legislative remedies. It is probably impossible to have such remedies but it is important that failure to achieve goals is recognised in the first instance and addressed in so far as possible.We need to look honestly and critically at the efficacy of various interventions in the education system in terms of the impact they are having. We all laud the breaking the cycle programme although it would be better to have ongoing assessment of whether it best achieves what is required. Voluntary homework programmes and other less formal community-based interventions offer great benefits. We need to pick up on those initiatives and give whatever support is necessary to ensure that they continue. We also need to look carefully at the school meals service and maybe do much more in basic areas to which one does not always advert in terms of education but which potentially have a significant and positive impact.There is serious concern at the increase in the numbers of those with the various autism spectrum disorders, ADD, ADHD, Asperger's syndrome and so on. While it is not the specific remit of education it is necessary to work on researching the causes and, particularly in the short-term, to support imaginative and sometimes non-traditional interventions and treatments, especially if they are not invasive. Parents tell me that their burden is considerably lightened by embarking on some of these programmes. Perhaps we should be more open to them than we have been heretofore.I appreciate the work of certain officials in the Department of Education and Science who are excellent public servants. They are snowed under with applications and follow-up phone calls about the special needs service. TDs, more than almost any other group, would recognise that there is only so much one can do in an 18 or 20 hour day. We should acknowledge the excellent work those people are doing, particularly when one bears in mind that the number of special resource teachers has increased from 104 to 2,300 in five years and special needs assistants from less than 300 to 5,500. That increase dealt with a large administrative burden. The learning support teacher service available to every school is small in number but does significant work. Since 1998 over 120 special classes have been created for children with autism where the maximum class size is six. This is one of the areas in which we are learning how to go forward and chart a progressive way. In so far as we can we ought to have those special classes in the context and within the confines of ordinary schools. It works better and the integration is very important.In this Bill the Minister has charted a difficult and very large role for the National Council for Special Education. Section 7 covers the formal planning process, the informal board has already done some work and there is a significant role for the special needs organisers. The Minister has set a five-year implementation target which I hope is attainable. It is a good goal towards which we should work and which we must achieve. There will be regret that people who are now in the system, and people for whom the system has not cared, will lose out to some extent by the five-year implementation process but at least, at the end of that time, let us have a system immeasurably better than that which exists, with the capacity to respond at a much earlier stage. The provisions here do that particularly well. In view of what I said previously I am impressed by section 10, which provides for a regular review of the education plan and picks up on the question of a child failing to achieve goals. It would be useful if there were a way to set out what ought to be done then.We have to recognise that it is very difficult for any of us as parents to accept the intellectual or any other disability of our children and to persuade those people to be party to the setting of realistic goals. There should be provision for professional support for the parents in addressing that area. I especially welcome their right to appeal to the independent board and there is a good case for other parties to have a similar right to appeal. Many of the groups which addressed the committee raised questions on section 12, which directs both the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children to make available resources.Politicians and parents are often frustrated by officials telling them it is somebody else's job and it is one of the few times this issue has been addressed in legislation. Both Ministers are responsible under section 12. The reference to the Minister for Finance is a realistic caveat. The Minister has provided more resources in this area in the past five or six years than did all his predecessors. The reality must be faced that resources are finite but in employing them through a properly planned and structure approach, a return will be generated that has not been the case heretofore.The Minister stated he would set up a consultative forum but it is not provided for in the legislation. However, it will be useful because it will enable those who have difficulty with the legislation as it evolves to point out where the weaknesses are and have them addressed. It will enable those who made submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science and to the Minister to have a role.With regard to the five-year target, early intervention is critical. Considerable progress is being made in the training of new speech, language and occupational therapists. Such resources will be needed to implement the Bill's provisions. Sometimes, even with the best will and all the financial resources in the world, this cannot be done because there are not enough trained professionals who are capable of delivering the service. Significant progress was made over the past two years in attracting people to take up these courses and that will pay off in four or five years when their training is complete. We will then be able to hold our heads high in terms of provision for people with special needs.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Minister should be congratulated on introducing the legislation. All the interest groups involved, especially those representing parents of children with disabilities, are thankful that, at long last, legislation has been introduced to address the many problems they have encountered in their lives. They are not satisfied with every aspect of the legislation but that is to be expected. The two previous contributors, Deputies Killeen and Stanton, are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science and their comments regarding the submissions made to them were interesting. Their contributions were also interesting because both are former teachers and they saw at first hand what was needed to address the problems of providing an education for persons with disabilities.Deputy Killeen referred to the effort put in by the committee to implement a number of the proposals they received and I hope the Minister will take a number of them on board on Committee Stage. All Members have received calls for amendments from various groups within their constituencies and I hope the Minister will include a number of the good proposals made during the debate.While most of the concerns raised with me relate to specific cases, they are also covered by provisions in the legislation. The primary concern relates to the co-ordination and implementation of the provisions because too many Departments and State agencies are involved in the achievement of the ultimate goal, which is the provision of education for persons with disabilities. The Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Finance are mentioned numerous times in the Bill and interested parties look on this as a major problem, although the Government does not envisage this issue as a major threat to the Bill's implementation.Reference has been made to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, which has a problem with the admittance of children with disabilities into mainstream schools because it is afraid the moneys needed for improved facilities and services will not be provided. This is a stark reminder of the experience of those at the coalface in the provision of education for persons with disabilities. The concerns of the association must be addressed and, while we will have an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage, it is a worry that such a body is putting forward proposals to be given the right to postpone entry of students to school, which, if supported by boards of management, would stymie the implementation of the Bill.The definition of "educational disability" has been raised on a number of occasions. Many support groups believe the definition is too narrow. They believe a proper definition is provided under the Education Act 1998 and the Employment Equality Act and feel the new definition is an effort by the Department to reduce its responsibility for persons in need of support. Support groups want the Minister to revisit the definition.With regard to other definitions, I refer to a submission received from a concerned parent whose child suffers from sensory integration dysfunction. She is finding it difficult to obtain assistance for the child. She states:Regarding the definition of the word "sensory", it is important that this is not just interpreted as sight and sound. There are seven senses, all of which send information to the brain where it is organised and interpreted. Sometimes the information from the senses is not flowing and integrating efficiently, resulting in what is known as Sensory Integration Dysfunction. This can result in difficulty with everyday living, skills, co-ordination, behaviour, movement, speech, language and learning. This dysfunction can be present in children with ADHD, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, autistic spectrum disorder, development co-ordination disorder and specific learning difficulties.This parent is so concerned that she felt it necessary to write to her local representative to highlight her case.Deputy Killeen stated it is difficult for everyone to be covered in the Bill but there is a need to examine whether it is possible to co-ordinate the definition of "educational disability" in the two Acts and this Bill. There should be a clear definition of "educational disability". Another aspect which has been brought to my attention is the need for training in all aspects of professional life associated with education, ranging from school principals down to cleaners. The whole emphasis in school life will change dramatically in the context of this Bill. Training must be provided on an ongoing basis. There is no point in having one-off courses and pretending that all problems have been resolved. Ongoing training must reflect the changes which will take place in education over a five or six-year period. All of the evidence and effects must be collated and fed back into the system. Otherwise, we will lose out on the benefit of an enormous amount of knowledge which will be gained through developments under this legislation.I ask the Minister to ensure that the Bill will be implemented in accordance with the concerns of the professional bodies and interest groups. Parents are concerned that a school to which their son or daughter may go will have the appropriate facilities to deal with his or her particular needs. That is a perfectly understandable expectation and I believe it is reflective of general concerns in this regard. It is essential that all of the evidence which will be available through the implementation of this Bill is properly collated and put through the various processes to ensure a better educational system for people with educational needs.In that regard, the financing of this legislation is of crucial importance. Currently, there are major problems with regard to the capital programme for primary schools. If that is indicative of what will happen in the case of this Bill, it may not be worth the paper on which it is written. I do not believe that is the Minister's intention. I believe he is honourable in what he is trying to do in this regard, as was the approach of the education and science committee in its deliberations on this matter.I hope this will lead to a marked improvement in this aspect of education, which has been neglected by successive Governments. This is the first major effort which has been made and, obviously, we need to get it right. That may be difficult, but we should make every possible effort to ensure that when this legislation is enacted it will represent our best efforts at this time. Some of the groups which approached me have suggested that there should be a requirement to conduct a complete review of this legislation after five years. I do not know whether that is feasible – I simply put it forward as it was conveyed to me in terms of ensuring that this Bill will be productive in reaching its ultimate goals.In the context of training, there is an urgent need to ensure that the services of occupational therapists, speech therapists, psychologists and other professionals whose input is necessary will be available. It would be quite pointless to enact this legislation unless we are fully confident that those requirements will be met. That is a matter within the remit of the Department of Education and Science, which ultimately determines the number of graduates in those professions who come through our third level colleges. We must ensure that the required number of qualified personnel will be available. The Department of Health and Children is unlikely to give education a higher priority than health. That will be a problem, unless we have enough specialists to deal with the matter. The question of depending on the Department of Health and Children to place education before health is at the root of concerns expressed by those groups which have been emphasising the importance of a coherent overall approach to the implementation of this Bill, having regard to its ultimate benefits.In my area, there is an excellent facility for autistic children, the Saplings School, of which I attended the official opening by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. That school is attempting to provide the necessary education to enable autistic children to get into mainstream education. I was greatly impressed by the intensity of the effort being made by the parents, tutors and school management towards that end. While those involved in such matters in a professional capacity will be quite familiar with the situation, it was a wonderful experience for me, as one who was not previously involved at that educational level, to observe the level of effort and commitment of those involved. It was easy to understand their anxiety for the enactment and implementation of this Bill.I hope the Minister will consider the concerns which have been mentioned, including overall co-ordination, review of the legislation if that is possible, training of school management and others involved and the provision of special needs assistants. The number of special needs assistants must be maintained and increased. Public representatives are constantly receiving complaints from parents about the withdrawal of special needs assistants. It is a cause of great disappointment to the parents concerned to find that what they had regarded as a major advancement for their child has been withdrawn. If we are to make progress, this situation will have to be addressed. The provision of special needs assistants must not be frustrated on the basis of financial considerations. Otherwise, this Bill will not represent the major advance we had expected.In the provision of occupational and speech therapists and other professional staff, I ask the Minister to ensure there is no competition between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science as to who gets what. Sufficient trained personnel must be provided to deal with all aspects of the situation.I again welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward. I know there will be many amendments and I hope the Minister's response will be positive. I also hope he will consider the report from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, as well as taking account of the points raised by Deputies in the course of this debate. In the final analysis, when this legislation is enacted, I hope we will have a structure which will meet the concerns and worries of the groups concerned, especially the parents of children with educational disabilities.

Some speakers have said this Bill is not worth the paper it is written on and it would be unfortunate if that phrase appeared in the public domain because it is important to have public confidence in this procedure. It would be reckless of Deputies who may be quoting the views of others to allow that phrase to become common currency in discussion of the Bill. Many people have put a lot of work into the Bill, not just on the Government side but all those who made submissions to the committee during the summer. We received hundreds of pages of submissions which were considered and tightly argued in the past few months, so that phrase is inappropriate.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	177	It is worth having the Deputy's clarification as clearly the phrase could be taken up incorrectly. Deputy Stanton may be quoting accurately but other Deputies used the phrase rather loosely, which is unfortunate.The Bill acknowledges the link between educational achievement and lifelong opportunities for those with disabilities. The Minister set out the great progress made in the past few years in this area and most people accept that that is the case. Those successes and achievements have created difficulties in terms of qualifications and the provision of extra resource teachers, as well as the built environment of schools coping with the new structures which have been put in place. The Bill is a landmark in legislation in that it provides an opportunity for a concerted approach rather than the unsatisfactory system we have at present, with parents beating a path to their Deputies or to the Department of Education and Science – previously they had to go to the Department of Health and Children – for the provision of extra teachers or resources on a piecemeal basis. This Bill will create a comprehensive nationwide system which will give parents, children and staff a degree of certainty as well as flexibility in delivery of these resources.The Joint Committee on Education and Science heard interesting submissions on this matter from many bodies in recent months and it was something of a departure in procedure to hear oral submissions on a published Bill before the Second Stage debate. I found it extremely useful, as did other committee members, and the organisations making submissions also found it helpful. This process should be repeated in the future.Deputy Stanton referred to one of the most interesting and important features of the summer hearings, which was the view expressed by the Psychological Society of Ireland, among others, that the legislation should be based on assessment of needs rather than the nature of the impairment of the child concerned. That was the most compelling and consistent argument I heard and I agree with it. It would be extremely helpful in ironing out some of the confusion regarding definitions mentioned by previous speakers.Some bodies which made submissions pointed out inconsistencies in definitions of "disability", "educational disability" and "child", referring to previous Acts, including the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the Education Act 1998. For example, the Education Act 1998 defines disability extensively in five different paragraphs and defines educational disadvantage. The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 defines a child as someone who has reached the age of 16 years or who has not completed three years of post-primary education. That differs from the definition in this Bill, but we should not be afraid of different definitions. The argument for consistency can be overwhelming and requires a level of perfection which is unachievable in an inconsistent world.The Irish Wheelchair Association made a very important observation in that its members do not suffer from an educational disability in the way most of us would understand the term. It suggested an alternative definition, "alternative educational requirement" as opposed to educational disability, which would not necessarily mean having to change the body of the definition, and I agree with it. One professional pointed out in his submission that he had never heard the phrase "educational disability" in his entire professional life, and we should take cognisance of that. Deputy Killeen pointed out earlier that the Minister is open to certain amendments on Committee Stage.Section 3 of the Act confers on the principal of a school the right to take steps to meet the educational needs of a child who is not benefiting from the normal curriculum before preparing an assessment of needs. This provision attracted a lot of attention during our hearings and it is probably wise to insert the previous requirement, namely, that the principal will have to take measures off his or her own bat first before contemplating the preparation of an assessment of needs. Objections to this provision centre on the fact that it builds another layer of failure into the life of the child. It means that the child, who has already failed to benefit from mainstream curriculum, must also fail an attempt by the principal to take measures to remedy the situation before there is an assessment.Many children will be conscious of this and as they are so sensitive about fitting in with the norm, this layer has certain dangers. I do not have an alternative proposal, as the principle that a student should be in mainstream education is important. Of course, there are some categories of children for whom this procedure is entirely pointless and for whom there is no chance of integration. It is also probably wise to allow a school principal to delegate these functions in certain schools, a point made by the school principals when they came in to the committee.Section 4 deals with pre-schools. Health boards deal with this area and the National Council for Special Education deals with it when the child is a student. The right of initiation is also given to parents by this section, which is welcome. The section states that the parents of a child have the right to initiate an assessment of a child, although the time constraints here are far greater than in other sections, allowing the council a full three months before initiating anything and then allowing them time to complete the process "without undue delay". That phrase is insufficiently precise and will inevitably have to be interpreted by a court. It is not good practice for the Oireachtas to insert phrases like that when it is within our gift to set down a specific timeframe – a month, six weeks or two months. We should remove that phrase and replace it with a specific time constraint within which a council must prepare an assessment.The voices of parents with children with disability have been heard in the Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Conscious of the success of the sponsorship arrangements in recent Presidencies, and the fact that this has very much become the norm, the Government took the view that the Presidency offers a valuable and important opportunity for Irish business to promote what is best about Ireland, in particular in the economic, trade and tourism areas.The main role of the Presidency is to advance the agenda of the European Union but it is has also always been the case that the Presidency of the day takes the opportunity to promote its country widely. It would be remiss of the Government if we did not maximise the exposure Ireland will gain from hosting the Presidency, which may well be the last of its kind. I also believe that sponsorship will help develop a wider ownership in, and involvement with, the Presidency.We have, in particular, modelled our approach on that applied by the very successful Danish Presidency by inviting offers of sponsorship from companies. All sponsorship will be in the form of goods and services – no cash sponsorship will be considered.There are a number of categories that particularly lend themselves to a sponsorship arrangement, such as transportation, catering, the provision of IT and telecommunications equipment and gifts in general. Similar categories have been sponsored during previous Presidencies. In this context, my Department contacted the various umbrella groups for business in Ireland such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotel Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to outline the sponsorship possibilities.We are encouraged by the number of companies who have expressed interest in sponsorship and negotiations with these parties are ongoing. Prior to entering into a contract, all offers for sponsorship are being presented to the interdepartmental Presidency planning group, which will then decide on the appropriate sponsorship arrangements.I am confident that, when complete, not only will the costs of hosting the Presidency be reduced but there will be a framework in place which will maximise the exposure of Irish products to a wider European and international audience. This can only be of real benefit to the country.

Are the criteria for assessing the offering of such sponsorship laid down? Are we sure we will keep to the right side of the line by ensuring that the symbols and independent sovereignty of the State are not interfered with by commercial operations gaining advantage over other commercial operations in this way? What guidelines are in place to deal with this?Will the Minister confirm that transparency will apply in this process and that information will be available to the Oireachtas on who applied to provide sponsorship, on the information contained in their applications and on the guidelines they were given when they made their applications?Is it intended to exclude from this process certain categories of businesses, such as those who sell alcoholic products and manufacture and sell cigarettes? What guidelines exist for this process and has the Minister laid a copy of them in the Oireachtas Library?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I want to make it clear that the purpose of this idea is to enhance the Presidency. There is no question of this being different from what has happened during previous Presidencies. All expressions of interest in sponsoring the Presidency are vetted by the interdepartmental group comprising officials of the Departments who are of high calibre and hold a high office.The areas to be covered by such agreements are logistical. They will not impact on the main decisions that have to be taken during the six months of the Presidency. Sponsorship has been a common feature of recent Presidencies. My officials have spoken to officials from earlier Presidencies and there was no question of any conflicts of interest. If there was a risk of such, the interdepartmental group and the Cabinet committee would not enter into a commitment with the company concerned.I want to explode the unfortunate myth that sometimes arises concerning such an initiative. Sponsorship is a common feature of recent Presidencies. I urge the Deputy to check the websites for the Danish, Greek and Italian Presidencies to note the calibre of companies that sponsored those Presidencies. Hosting the Presidency costs money and sponsorship will allow the Exchequer to defray some of those costs.The cost, however, is not the main reason we are seeking sponsorship. Sponsorship will allow Irish companies and companies with Irish interests to get positive exposure to an audience with whom they may not normally have the chance to interact. It will also enhance Ireland's reputation as a place to visit or to do business. All sponsorship applications are carefully vetted. There is no question of sponsorship arrangements affecting the conduct of the Presidency or affecting Ireland's approach to policy issues domestically or in Brussels.There are no decisions taken on this matter. I have indicated the reputable umbrella organisations that were contacted. Applications are being considered. Later this month when the group comes to make decisions, I will make that information available to the House and I have no problem ensuring that the transparency that people require will apply. I want to make it clear that the idea is to enhance the situation not to detract from it.

Can he confirm that we will not have anything such as the Budweiser Derby, the Budweiser European Council or the Tullamore Dew Ministers shindig? What will happen in terms of the various dinners that will be held? I presume we will not allow companies to sponsor alcohol for such meals and related events.

It is unfortunate that people take a negative view of this. I can assure this House that this will be in line with other successful Presidencies that have been held in other countries in recent times. There was some limited sponsorship during our last Presidency. People need to be fully aware that no decisions have been taken. An interdepartmental group is examining this situation. This is about enhancing the quality and image of the country. When decisions are taken and notified to the public and to the House, I believe people will be happy with the arrangements.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Government does not have any information on casualty figures other than those readily available in the public domain. These usually vary between 8,000 and 15,000. My officials have been in contact with relevant multilateral organisations on this matter but none of the organisations involved was in a position to give us such figures, as they either did not compile them or could not guarantee their reliability.At the Madrid conference Ireland pledged up to €3 million to the future humanitarian and recovery needs of Iraq. It is intended that this pledge will be mainly channelled through the UN window of the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq, and through valued partners such as UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs. Discussions will take place over the coming months with these partner organisations to examine sectors and priorities on a needs basis. This pledge was in addition to €5 million in humanitarian assistance delivered to date in 2003.In its statement at the Madrid conference, Ireland clearly outlined its views on the best conditions for the successful reconstruction of Iraq. Ireland considers it essential that the recovery and reconstruction process is undertaken in a safe and secure operating environment; is owned and implemented by the Iraqi people; that high levels of international engagement are sustained for as long as is necessary; and that the UN is at the heart of the recovery process.As regards the final part of the question, I have no knowledge of the locations and circumstances in which prisoners are being held in Iraq. There are no indications at present that any prisoners being taken in Iraq have been transferred, for example, to Guantanamo Bay.However, the Government has from the outset called on all parties in the conflict to respect their obligations under international law both in regard to the status of civilians and in regard to prisoners of war. This policy is in keeping with the public pronouncements of UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and had been established long before the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1483. This resolution calls upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law including, in particular, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907. The treatment of prisoners of war is specifically covered by the Third Geneva Convention. The US and UK have publicly committed themselves to doing so.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, aware of the report published yesterday by Medact in association with the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize winners, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War? The report suggests that military deaths in Iraq range between 13,500 and 45,000 and civilian casualties between 5,708 and 7,356. I understand when the Minister says that there are difficulties in establishing absolute figures. However, is the Minister concerned that since President Bush announced the war was over, the number of casualties on the US and British side have exceeded the total number of casualties during the war? There seems to be little international attention to Iraqi casualties, particularly among civilians.It is extraordinary that the Minister cannot say how many prisoners there are, the conditions in which they are held and even where they are, when Ireland tacitly supports the occupation through maintaining the availability of Shannon Airport to US forces. It is a clear requirement of the occupying forces to uphold the Geneva Convention. On the medical side, it is pointless to say that conditions are difficult. Of course they are, but the occupying forces also carry an obligation under the Geneva Convention regarding medical facilities.What has been done to ensure that Irish funding of humanitarian aid goes to the specified agencies? I support what we give in humanitarian aid to UNICEF. However, what is the Minister doing when US forces claim that this aid was solicited by people serving in the forces who wrote home and, also, that the schools assisted by UNICEF are assisted by private donations from the United States? Has the Minister taken measures to protect the integrity of the aid organisations, including UN ones, and their desire to stay separate from the military occupation of Iraq?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I am not aware of the report that the Deputy referred to and I will have it checked. I am concerned at the continuing loss of life in Iraq and the occurrence of terrorist bombings and attacks. We want to see a secure environment there as quickly as possible. On the political track, we want to see the sovereignty of interim Iraqi authorities restored through incrementalism, until such time as constitutional elections can be held and a representative Government elected.We support UN Resolution 1511. However, we do not give tacit support to the occupation and instead support the UN's efforts to bring about the restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people. We believe that Resolution 1511 provides a framework for necessary further discussions within the Security Council and the international community to bring these efforts about.The Deputy can be assured that we carefully monitor where our humanitarian aid goes. The pledges that were made in Madrid refer to future humanitarian aid pledges. We have already spent €5 million this year and are satisfied that it went to the agencies we specified. For the pledged €3 million, we will enter into further discussions with those reputable agencies to ensure that the aid goes where we want it to go.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Ireland's policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is well known and of long standing. Since the early 1980s, Ireland has supported the concept of a Palestinian state living beside Israel in peace and security. This concept is now generally accepted in the international community and is incorporated in the roadmap for Middle East peace, elaborated by the international quartet of Russia, the US, the EU and the UN.The roadmap sets out a series of measures, in three phases, to be taken by the two sides in the areas of security, economic and humanitarian policy and political development. These measures include an end to settlement expansion, a renewal of security co-operation, resolute action against terrorism and a lifting of closures. It provides for an international monitoring mechanism to be established in consultation with the parties and sets a timeframe for the parties to meet their obligations. In the first half of 2004, Ireland will hold the EU Presidency and it will be our responsibility to represent the European Union within the international quartet and we shall press to ensure that the roadmap is implemented and that the two parties meet their obligations in full and in parallel.Some have suggested that the roadmap has run into a dead end and that a new initiative should be brought forward. The reality is that the roadmap contains all the elements which must form part of any comprehensive solution and that there is no evident scope for a further initiative other than in the framework of the roadmap.As I have said previously, certain elements are essential to revive the peace process. These include a renewal of the ceasefire and an end to terrorist activity and to extra-judicial killings. There must also be an active security policy on the part of the Palestinian Authority, and an end to settlement building and the construction of the separation wall on Palestinian land.I am aware of the call by Dr. Nabil Shaath for international observers to assist the peace process. In fact there are already international observers active in and around the Palestinian town of Hebron. There is also considerable monitoring work carried out by the diplomatic missions of the European Union in the occupied Palestinian territories. This is reflected in their regular reports on Jerusalem, settlements and other issues. The Government supports the principle of an international monitoring presence in the occupied Palestinian territories under the auspices of the international quartet, and will make Irish personnel available to participate in such a presence, subject to the usual requirements of the Defence Acts.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, for his detailed response.Does the Minister accept that this Israeli Government – not its people – is behaving like a rogue state, ridiculing international law and making a mockery of the Geneva Conventions? It is time to wake up to the latest acts of Israeli aggression. Recently, there have been helicopter strikes in Gaza, killing 14 Palestinians and injuring 160. The invasion of the Rafah refugee camp left 18 dead, including three children, and over 200 homes destroyed, with 2,000 refugees homeless again. This is an unacceptable way for a state to act.Does the Minister support the UN resolution concerning Israel's apartheid wall that was overwhelmingly endorsed by the General Assembly? I urge the Minister to use all his power and influence at EU and UN levels to send observers and move forward the attempts to restore the peace process. Does the Minister accept that Ireland as a small, neutral state, can play a significant role in this matter?Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to Iraqi civilian deaths. We must also approach Palestinian deaths with fairness and equality. In the western media, the impression is given that they do not count. Will the Minister go out on the international stage and push this matter onto the agenda?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	190	We all agreed that there should be no hierarchy of grief and no priority given to the deaths of one ethnic group or another. However, Deputy Finian McGrath did not condemn Palestinian suicide bombings either. We need to recognise that there is a failure on both sides to meet the responsibilities under the roadmap. If we want to have influence we must be cognisant of the fact that there have been some symbolic gestures on one side and ineffective security responses on the other. In addition, I condemn extra-judicial killings, suicide bombings, occupation and all of these things. However, utterances of condemnation do not move the situation forward. We must now support the new Palestinian Cabinet that has been appointed. Through the quartet group we must work with the Israeli Government to encourage it to meet its responsibilities. The responsibilities are on both sides and are in parallel. As we know from our own peace process the politics of condemnation and the politics of the last atrocity do not propel the peace process forward.While acknowledging the futility of violence on all sides, let us use the opportunity of having the EU Presidency to call on all sides to come to the table to recognise there is no military solution to this problem, and that the best prospect of securing the interests of the respective peoples of Palestine and Israel is through an effective peace process as set out in the roadmap and the need for people to get on with implementing it. This is how we can add value to what we can achieve during our Presidency of the European Union. This will be my approach.I will meet the Israeli Foreign Minister on the margins of a Council meeting next Tuesday to discuss these matters. I will make these points regarding their need to meet their responsibilities just as I told President Arafat when I met him that the Palestinians need to meet their responsibilities also.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Consular facilities are available to all Irish citizens who live or travel abroad and who seek such assistance from the Department or any of our missions abroad. I believe that, within the limits of the available resources, the Department provides the best possible service in this regard. Our network of diplomatic and consular missions includes 49 embassies and 12 consulates general. In addition, there are 25 honorary consuls general and 60 honorary consuls who provide assistance to Irish citizens in 59 countries.In providing consular services, my Department is guided by a number of international instruments on human rights and consular relations. These prescribe the rights of states in acting to protect the interests of their citizens abroad. Foremost among these is the Vienna convention of 1963 on consular relations.There are more than 1 million Irish-born citizens living abroad. In addition, there are millions more people of Irish descent, many of whom hold dual citizenship. The holding of dual citizenship does not diminish the entitlement of an Irish citizen to seek Irish consular protection, with one exception. Under international law, a state cannot extend full consular protection to a citizen who holds dual nationality if that citizen is residing in the country of the citizen's second nationality. In addition, if an Irish citizen is visiting or residing in a country of which he or she is also a citizen, he or she may be subject to laws, which apply only to citizens of that second country. In those circumstances, Irish consular staff might be able to give only limited assistance.However, every person born in Ireland remains an Irish citizen, whatever the nationality or status of his or her parents and, if travelling on an Irish passport in a third country, is entitled to seek Irish consular assistance.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I thank the Minister for his reply. I realise there are limited consular facilities. My experience of those facilities is that they try to assist in every way possible. What applies in this case is the de facto expulsion of Irish citizens because they are minors, often – but not exclusively – babies in arms and younger children. In these circumstances, would the Minister consider introducing some pro-active consular service to try to ensure there is at least traceability and these minors who, under the Constitution are due the protection and any assistance the Government can give them if in danger, are protected as well as possible by the consular service?Does the Minister know the number of minors holding Irish citizenship who were de facto expelled from this country because their parents were expelled? The Minister will be aware that in many cases these are the children of vulnerable people, many of whom have claimed refugee status and some of whom have personal difficulties in their own countries. These minors, who are Irish citizens, may have particular difficulties and may be especially vulnerable. I ask the Minister to consider initiating some consular service which would monitor and be available to these minors who are citizens to protect their interests when they are de facto expelled from the country.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Regarding what consular help can be given to assert the rights of Irish citizens, including minors in the country in which they may now be living, under the Vienna convention on consular relations, a state's consular function includes safeguarding the interests of minors within the laws and regulations of the receiving state. In practice, therefore, our ability to provide assistance may be limited particularly, as I have already said, if the Irish citizens are also citizens of the country in which they are living.The Supreme Court decision in the case of L and O on 23 January 2003 makes it clear that the State, acting through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has a right to deport the non-national parents of Irish children, even where that decision results in the effective removal of the Irish-born child. Irrespective of my view in the matter, this is the view of the Supreme Court and the constitutional position of children in such cases.The cases of each of the 10,000 non-national parents who are affected will be considered individually and on their own merits having regard to a range of factors relevant under existing law. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already indicated that there will be no mass deportations in that respect.As I have already said, the entitlement of Irish citizens abroad to consular services does not depend on the nationality or immigration status of the parents. Regarding any supplementary information I can give on the consequences of the Supreme Court decision provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would be that the principles set out in the case include a requirement that the person be given a 15-day period in which to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made. Even if representations are not made, the Minister is required to have regard to a range of different factors, including humanitarian considerations, in determining whether a deportation order should be made.Most importantly, the making of a deportation order is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which forbids the sending of a person in any manner whatsoever to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This overarching principle is the cornerstone of Ireland's repatriation system.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The Government's position on security and defence issues has been clearly stated at the Intergovernmental Conference. Together with a number of other neutral and non-aligned member states, we have expressed reservations about the proposal for closer co-operation on defence. Concerns have also been voiced by a number of EU partners who see their security and defence requirements being best and satisfactorily met through their membership of NATO. The draft treaty articles in the security and defence area remain the subject of deliberation at the Intergovernmental Conference.There is already provision for a possible European Union common defence in the current treaty. Such a decision would be a matter for the European Council acting unanimously, and for member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The possibility of a common defence has been agreed by the Irish people on three successive occasions in their decisions to approve the ratification of the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties. A similar provision is carried over in the draft constitutional treaty.The article of the draft constitutional treaty as it is currently worded and to which Deputy Gormley refers, proposes "closer co-operation" on an optional basis in the area of mutual defence. This would be dependent on a decision by the European Council to move to a full common defence involving all member states. Under this proposal, a member state which opts to participate in this arrangement, and which is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, would be able to request aid and assistance from other participating states. Member states opting not to participate in this arrangement would be under no obligation arising from it.As the Government has stated on a number of occasions, Ireland cannot adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence where that common defence would include the State unless the people decide otherwise in a referendum. This is in accordance with the amendment to the Constitution approved by the people by referendum in October of last year. Therefore, there is no question of the Government agreeing to Ireland's participation in closer co-operation in the area of mutual defence, other than with the approval of the Irish people expressed in a referendum. The Taoiseach made this clear to the Deputy when he was asked the same question at the National Forum on Europe last month.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I welcome the fact that the Irish delegation has expressed reservations, as it did in the Convention. I am glad to hear we are working closely with other neutral states. When the Taoiseach replied to me at the Forum for Europe, he made his views known. The Minister will appreciate that sometimes it is difficult to understand what the Taoiseach is saying. What he did not say was that he would include some sort of amendment in the Constitution to ensure that Article 40.7 is covered so that we would be required to have a referendum. If the Minister is referring to what we agreed at Nice, that refers specifically to Nice. Notwithstanding that, it states, "The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence policy, pursuant to article 1.2 of the Treaty referred to . . . where the common defence would include the State."In the draft European Constitution, Article 40.2, which takes its lead from Nice, states that the common security and defence policy shall include "the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy" and this will lead to a common defence "when the European Council, acting unanimously" so decides. Article 40.7 states that "until such time" as the European Council has acted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article, "closer co-operation" shall be established. We are talking about closer co-operation as regards common defence and when one reads the whole thing it certainly looks like a mutual defence pact.I do not believe we are covered in terms of a referendum. I take the Minister's assurance but I want to nail him down on this. Will it be put into the Constitution before we have a new referendum? We will have this referendum. Will the Minister say when he thinks these discussions will be concluded at the Intergovernmental Conference? I note from yesterday's newspaper that Sweden and Finland have expressed their reservations. I hope the Minister has put forward his position as well and that he will seek an amendment or insert one in our own Constitution so that we will have a referendum to decide whether Ireland embarks on closer co-operation as regards common defence.There are two issues we are concerned about. The Minister could decide to join without a referendum and, second, the fear articulated by the Finns and Swedes that one may now have a group of countries working together, forming a core within a group – as, for example the Petersberg Tasks – under the EU flag, and we are not involved in that decision-making. Those are the two concerns. Will the Minister address, in particular, the question of the referendum?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I appreciate, as Deputy Gormley says, that this is a somewhat complex and technical area. I will be as clear as I possibly can. We have a constitutional provision that should the European Council take a decision to establish a common defence, there has to be a referendum of the Irish people before an Irish Government of whatever hue can adapt to that. In the draft constitutional treaty, there are provisions that emerged from the Convention. Before we have had concepts such as "enhanced" co-operation. We are now talking about "structured" co-operation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Closer co-operation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Closer co-operation and structured co-operation is another part of the defence architecture they are talking about. Our constitutional provision protects us in so far as we cannot enter into any mutual defence obligation without a referendum. As the Deputy said, in the three previous constitutional treaties there has been provision for an aspiration to work towards or progress towards common defence. We have fully participated in European security and defence policy, consistent with our foreign policy traditions, while that work has been continuing.An important point must be made about the structured co-operation proposal, which is still under consideration and not finalised in terms of its discussion. We cannot debate it clearly until we see what the final outcome of these discussions will be. Structured co-operation is an "opt-in" proposal. There is no automaticity involved. Ireland is not going to be drawn into having to take responsibility for any arrangements which it is not happy about. It is open to us to opt into certain arrangements at any time, short of common defence, because that is what the constitutional provision stipulates.If the Deputy is asking whether we are now going to have a referendum as regards structured co-operation, we do not know the outcome of the discussions yet, so I cannot give an answer to that.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	204	It remains—
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	205	There is an attempt sometimes, having agreed that Ireland cannot be party to a common defence policy without a referendum, to present me with another bar by insisting structured co-operation also requires a referendum. I am not in a position to give any commitment in that regard, because it is a "opt-in" arrangement and it is prior to the establishment of a common defence.To answer the question on the referendum issue, while a formal decision will only be taken when a new treaty has been negotiated, it is highly likely that a further referendum will be required for Ireland to ratify it. We know that. Should the existing provision on common defence be amended or added to in any way, the Government would have to take this into account in framing the proposal it puts to the people, in line with the substance and the spirit of the recent constitutional amendment.This is not a commitment by me to lower the bar in terms of the common defence requirement. It is simply, as Deputy Gormley said, related to the current constitutional amendment which refers to the Nice treaty. In adopting this treaty we may require amendments to make sure that the spirit and substance of what we have already committed ourselves to remains. In the meantime, if in that new treaty there are provisions as regards structured or enhanced or closer co-operation, we have an opt-in provision – we are not automatically lined in – and we will continue to participate in the European Security and Defence Policy consistent with our own traditions, short of common defence being established. That is the best way I can express it for the moment.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 16 together.The Irish development assistance programme in Uganda has a budget this year of €32 million and is likely to have a budget of approximately the same scale next year. I assume the Deputy who tabled Question No. 16 means to refer to the current 2003 budget and the projected one for 2004. There are two sets of safeguards, which ensure that funding from the Irish Government is used solely for the purposes agreed and cannot be diverted elsewhere.Our strategy in Uganda, as well as that of other donors, is informed by a broad-based, pro-poor economic plan, the poverty eradication action plan. We and other donors, along with the World Bank, review all expenditure each year and agree the budgetary allocations for the coming year. We determine in advance, therefore, the level of Ugandan and donor funding to be allocated to key social sectors like health and education. In addition to this transparent budget process, there are specific commitments and agreements which keep Ugandan military expenditure within tight limits. Under these arrangements, it is not possible for the funding we provide to be availed of to support military activity, whether in Uganda or in neighbouring countries.We have significant oversight and accountability processes which enable us to track how funding is used and to ensure that it reaches its intended targets. A range of measures ensures that our aid programme in Uganda is subject to internal and external evaluation and audit and that all our expenditure is subject to rigorous accounting. I have decided to redirect funding out of direct budget support and into a specifically ring-fenced poverty action fund, which covers key sectors of Government expenditure such as health and education.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	207	President Museveni came here recently on what was described as a charm offensive. I wonder if the Minister of State was charmed by him and if he raised human rights issues with the Ugandan head of state. There have been a number of reports about human rights violations within Uganda and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I am referring in particular to the Human Rights Watch report and the number of atrocities and massacres Uganda was involved in. Did the Minister specifically raise those massacres with him and the violations of human rights?Did the Minister of State raise the issue of how Uganda holds sway in the Ituri province in the Congo? It has been estimated that 50,000 people have been killed in this conflict. Child soldiers have been recruited which is something about which we are all concerned.Under freedom of information legislation, it was revealed in The Sunday Business Post that Mr. John O'Shea expressed great concern about this area. In many ways, the Minister of State has acted to comply with his wishes. He was quoted as expressing concern that John O'Shea's campaign to stop aid to Uganda was undermining his efforts. Is that still the view of the Minister of State, or does he believe that Mr. O'Shea's view has been of assistance to his Department?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	208	There are a number of issues. This is the second occasion on which I met Mr. Museveni. I met him recently in Tokyo at an important EU-Africa meeting at which we discussed all the issues to which the Deputy referred. As a result of that discussion he suggested that he come to Ireland to answer many of the valid questions the Deputy raised.Uganda is a country in which we are doing extremely good work. I have seen the standard and quality of our work which helps the poorest of the poor. Situations such as this are complex and it is difficult to evaluate the action we should pursue. I am satisfied that we are engaging in the right way. We have implemented stricter controls on our funding. I am also satisfied that we are engaged with the Ugandan authorities at the highest level.The fact that the President came here means he takes seriously the concerns we have on behalf of taxpayers. I raised all the issues to which the Deputy referred in regard to the Congo. The situation in the north regarding the Lord's Resistance Army was raised, as was the situation in Ituri. Many of the responses given are in the public domain or at least are in the possession of the media. Issues of governance exist which are of concern to us. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that governance and dealing with corruption are development issues.I met John O'Shea on a number of occasions and respect his opinions. His voice is an important one in the area of development. I agreed to differ with him on his analysis of how to proceed with this issue. We are not uncritical of what is taking place in Uganda. The way forward in the country is complex and we will monitor the situation carefully. My overriding concern is to help the poorest of the poor, which we are doing. It is of vital importance that we have accountability with regard to taxpayer's money. We are dealing with it correctly on these grounds but we will monitor the situation as we proceed.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The Minister of State is aware that a delegation is in the House from the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is a very poor country where the annual per capita income is €101. Recently documented evidence shows that Uganda is pillaging diamonds and other natural resources from the DRC.Like the Minister of State, I met the visiting Ugandan delegation in the recent past and raised these questions with it. I accept what the Minister of State said about traceabilty and control, in so far as he can control the aid we give Uganda. Will he inform the House of the monitoring and control procedures in place to ensure that, for example, the aid we give to Uganda does not displace aid from within Uganda which is used for military purposes or pillaging its neighbour, the Congo? Is he satisfied that genuine efforts are being made to root out corruption in Uganda, that the administration is serious about protecting human rights and behaving in a civilised way and that good governance is seriously and determinedly on the agenda there?

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Deputy Gay Mitchell raised some issues with which we are very much engaged and which have been raised by us with the Ugandan President.He referred to the situation in the Congo into which a UN panel of experts inquired. Allegations have been made about certain individuals there. Mr. Museveni assured us that he is co-operating fully with this investigation and the Porter commission. We sought assurances on these issues regarding the investigations.Our system of accountability is comprehensive. We have an embassy in Uganda and we work with the Ugandan auditor general. In fact, with other donors, we support this office. We have a chief accountant in Dublin and the Deputy will be aware of how stringent that is. We are dealing with all the corruption issues to which the Deputy referred. There are development challenges, including the reform of the judiciary, the police force and the prison service.One can take a simplistic approach to Uganda and say that events are taking place we do not like. Ugandan troops have withdrawn from the Congo. There are imperfections in governance with which we have to deal. One could say that the situation looks gloomy for the future. I do not suggest that this country has passed all the tests, but we are there, with other donors, to engage on these issues. I am convinced that, by engaging, we make a difference not just to the position of the poorest of the poor, which is my major concern, but also to the many issues the Deputy rightly raised.We will monitor the ongoing situation in consultation with other donors. As the Deputy is aware, we are not there alone. The Dutch, British and others are also present. Other countries have taken different approaches. We are measured in our response and will analyse carefully the type of aid we give in future. We will openly discuss in the Dáil and committees how we will do that.Our advisory group has returned from a recent visit to Uganda and I will meet it formally to ascertain its views on what is happening there. This is an important part of our approach. Although Uganda reflects many of the problems of Africa I would be slow to walk away from a situation where we are making a difference.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The Minister of State is right in that the Ugandan situation reflects many of the problems of Africa. From his reply, he appears to suggest that there are some good points. I refer in particular to its success in combating AIDS which has dropped from an incidence of 18% to 6% of the population. This is a success story. Does the Minister of State believe that other countries can learn from this? What does he think is the key to success in this area?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The leadership of President Museveni is a crucial factor in the reduction of those infected by HIV-AIDS. In 1992, 30% of people were infected and the figure now stands at 6%.The figure for participation in primary education has risen from 2.7 million to 7 million. Huge advances have been made on the broader issues, the areas in which we are closely involved. While we have to take account of problems we should also measure the successes in which we are involved.I would like to see more involvement in the area of human rights. The fact that the country's president came here to engage with us shows that he takes seriously the points we are discussing today. I wish other African leaders would take a similar approach. They are quite vulnerable on that front. Uganda is now an open book. Many investigations have been carried out, some of which still have to reach a conclusion. To a certain extent the country is a sitting target for those who suggest we should withdraw. I would be careful of knee-jerk reactions on this issue. I stress the complexity of this area. I am pleased we have the opportunity to discuss the matter today.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I realise we are almost out of time on this question, but I must tell the Minister of State that nobody wants the Government to withdraw from the mass primary education programme and those programmes assisting in the reduction of HIV and AIDS. I support those programmes, but there are two stories continually circulating which must be considered.Would it not be in everybody's interest if the Department of Foreign Affairs commented on the current status of the UN investigation of events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo? There are two stories. We who are interested in the humanitarian aspects of the matter can continually and correctly stress what I have mentioned above. There are also questions which can be answered on the Congo. Perhaps the Department of Foreign Affairs should develop the habit of admitting that conclusions cannot be drawn if that is the case. I put it to the Minister of State that while he says the Ugandans have withdrawn, they have done so having left surrogates in place. This is a matter on which the Minister of State should have an opinion.People trot out notions about corruption, but there must be two sides to create corruption. What do we know about the people who are buying the illegal diamonds? The Minister mentioned the Porter commission. The other story is that the former Ugandan minister with responsibility for development, who should have been dismissed but was not, came here and made presentations. Ireland's relationship with Uganda is being damaged by the fact that two competing stories are in circulation. The issue can be addressed. Even if conclusions cannot be drawn, we need a statement on the Ugandan relationship with the Congo and on the alleged involvement of members of the Ugandan Government in the diamond trade. The Minister of State should tell the House what we have found out from our European partners about who is involved on the other side of diamond transactions and, therefore, keeping the corruption going.

Higgins followed the comments made by President Museveni during his visit here. In defence of his situation in the Congo, he mentioned the fact that Uganda felt it was quite entitled to enter the eastern part of that country on the basis that it was being attacked from there and from the Sudan. The Deputy has put me in the position of defending the President and I am paraphrasing what he said. The President felt there was an Islamic fundamentalist threat from the north.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Deputy Michael D. Higgins asked what our reaction is and I am giving it to him.President Museveni also suggested that the threat from the north was combined with a similar threat from the Congo. He acknowledged and admitted that Uganda had supported in the past two militia groups in north-eastern Congo. My understanding is that Uganda has withdrawn its army, though I believe it still has a support mechanism in place in the Congo. Possibly that support does not include arms.All of these issues are being investigated, particularly the exploitation of the DRC's mineral resources. The UN panel of experts has unfinished business in the country. As soon as we have all the facts, we will, of course, state our position very clearly. My point is that we are engaged with this Government. The President has come here and we have not been shy about putting to him the points Deputy Michael D. Higgins has raised. That is the best way forward. On issues of governance and making our case to the public, I have some ideas about the best way forward. It is important to have a public debate.The debate on Uganda has damaged the very good development programme in that country, but, positively, it has broadened public awareness of complex development issues. We will continue to engage on these issues and we will continue to keep Deputies informed.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The Minister of State will be aware that, conveniently, the area which was invaded happened to be very rich in diamonds and raw materials. In the Congo, 3.3 million people have died because of activities of the kind which have been outlined.The question put down asked about forecasted contributions to Uganda from the Exchequer. Can the Minister of State tell the House if the level of aid is likely to increase over the next five to six years? Is aid more likely to go to NGOs than directly to the Government?

In my initial reply I said the sum next year would be approximately the same. It will certainly be no more next year than it was this year. The precise budget for these countries is being worked out as we speak. I am pleased to tell Deputies that we have done well in discussions on the Estimates. The House will be informed about that shortly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The demand of the Chagossian natives to return to the Chagos archipelago is a complex issue which involves competing sovereignty claims. The Chagos islanders' right of return and claims for compensation are the subject of legal proceedings in both the UK and USA. I understand that although the Chagos islanders' claims for compensation and immediate return were dismissed recently in the High Court in Britain, this verdict may be appealed.The Government will continue to monitor the situation of the Chagossian archipelago and the claims of the Chagos islanders. We wish to see the issue resolved through an agreement by all concerned parties. The EU has not addressed the issue of the demands of the Chagos islanders for the right of return to their homeland.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	228	This is an appropriate matter for the European Union to address since Britain is a member state. This has been one of the most outrageous abuses of decolonisation. Islands which had been occupied for several generations were described as uninhabited. They became, in effect, terra nuova and the allegedly unoccupied land was sold to become a military base. The people involved were reduced to degradation in Mauritius, which is what the court case was about. People with British passports were denied the right to return to their homeland. It is a most appropriate matter to raise with the European Union.The issue of sovereignty is an appropriate matter to refer to the United Nations committee on decolonisation. As the Minister will be aware, the issue arose in 1965. In 1974, the last of the islanders was dragged off the islands to make room for a military base. The base employs over 1,000 people, none of whom can, by direction, be from the Chagos people. They used their British passports to go to the UK to take a case, but because their numbers are so few, they tend to be forgotten. An outrageous abuse of international law has taken place.There is no dispute about sovereignty because Britain was warned by the UN decolonisation committee in 1965 that it would be in breach of international law if it described the islands as unoccupied. It forced the breach and broke the law. It signed a lease and as late as 1990 the Government of the United States of America said it refused to leave because the islands might be used by subversives and international terrorists. The islanders were not absorbed into the population of Mauritius where they were discriminated against and they are now living like vagrants in a British city.The number of people involved may be small, but the issue is enormous in terms of what it tells one about those countries with colonial pasts which are now fellow members of the European Union. This issue besmirches the European Union and the British Government should be told that. The United Nations committee should be asked to resume an interest in the issue.

I do not in any way claim to be an expert in this area. Discussions are continuing between the Governments of Mauritius and the UK on the status of this archipelago and I encourage both sides to continue these, with a view to reaching an agreed solution on the fate of the islanders. One of the main reasons there has been a failure to come up with a Common Position within the EU is probably that legal actions have been taking place. If it was ever raised, I never heard anyone mention it or saw documentation in that regard in my time on the General Affairs Council.

This case is a classic one of an abused colony, if there is such thing as a colony which has not been abused. The people in the archipelago are looking for compensation for their being hoodwinked, starved, terrorised, bribed and evicted, and the right to return to their homeland. The conflict is that, in contravention to the Indian Ocean zone of peace declaration, there is a US nuclear military base on Diego Garcia. There have been calls for the base to be stood down and forces withdrawn because the threat against which they were placed there no longer exists. Therefore, it should be returned to the people to whom it belonged in the first instance.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I outlined the Government's position in this regard to the Deputy. This archipelago lies in the Indian Ocean, comprising 65 small islands which cover an area of 60 sq. km., the largest of which is Diego Garcia – the site of a major US military air base. I understand that, in a ruling in November 2000, the English High Court upheld the Chagossian natives' right to return and stated that there was no source of lawful authority to justify the removal of the islanders. The ruling also granted the islanders British citizenship. Following this ruling, the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin Cook, agreed to a feasibility study to facilitate the return of the islanders and, following that study, the assessment of the UK Government was that the return of all Chagossian natives on a long-term basis was not feasible and that the viability of return is complicated by the US Diego Garcia base and the authorisation which would be required for habitation of the island.As I stated, discussions are continuing between the Governments of Mauritius and the UK in order to seek a resolution of the matter. A recent decision could be under appeal. There is no common EU position and I have outlined the Irish position as best I can.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 83 together.As the Deputy points out, approximately 2,000 trade unionists have been killed in Colombia since 1991, with a particularly heavy toll in 2002 when, according to CUT, the main Colombian congress of trade unions, 172 affiliated members were killed, including 49 senior trade union officials. There were also 26 abductions and 17 attempted abductions last year. A further 164 received death threats and it is alleged that 132 were arbitrarily detained by the state security services.Amnesty International reports that the number of trade unionists assassinated so far this year is 58. There is also a reduction in the level of kidnapping. However, there are credible reports of a significant increase in death threats to trade unionists and their relatives, and an increase in arbitrary detentions. In regard to the attribution of responsibility for these appalling crimes, Colombian trade union sources blame illegal paramilitary organisations, usually described as right wing, for 80% of all assassinations up to the year 2000. However, more recently they are assigning increasing responsibility to the illegal FARC organisation on the other side of the ideological spectrum. It seems that trade unionists believe that the FARC was responsible for many of the exceptionally high number of murders of their colleagues in 2002.The 59th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in March and April 2003 urged the Government of Colombia to implement measures "to guarantee the right to life, the physical integrity and the ability to function freely of leaders of trade unions and employers' organisations". The commission welcomed the re-activation by the Government of Colombia of the interinstitutional commission for the promotion and protection of workers' human rights. It also expressed the hope that its work would lead to the adoption of additional and more efficient measures to guarantee their life and personal safety and strengthen their protection, in particular by implementing the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation, ILO.At the same session of the Human Rights Commission, the European Union was particularly concerned to urge the Colombian Government to make the most effective and efficient use of measures in place to fully protect the security and rights of trade unionists, as well as to investigate and bring prosecutions against all those responsible, including members of state forces, who collaborate with paramilitary groups. The EU intervened in the same urgent sense at the March 2003 session of the governing body of the ILO.Lethal attacks against trade unionists are regrettably just one of many terrible manifestations of the violent conflict which afflicts Colombia and with which Ireland and our EU partners remain closely engaged by affording all possible constructive assistance and co-operation in order to alleviate the plight of the Colombian people, with a view ultimately to a negotiated and peaceful settlement. A meeting in London on 10 July 2003 brought together all Colombia's major donors, including the EU, as well as the Colombian Government itself.In the London declaration, the international community reaffirmed its political support for the Colombian Government in its efforts to address threats to democracy, terrorism, illegal drugs, human rights and international humanitarian law violations and the serious humanitarian crisis. Delegates also expressed their support for all efforts to develop the fully-functioning institutions of a democratic state throughout the Colombian territory.On the specific question of human rights, all parties expressed their grave concern and voiced their strong support for the work undertaken by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. They noted the Colombian Government's pledge to implement the specific, Recommendations for Colombia 2003, contained in the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights earlier this year. All parties urged the Colombian Government to proceed promptly to take effective action against impunity and collusion.As the current Italian Presidency draws to a close in December, the EU will review progress in the implementation of the London declaration. In light of any decisions taken on foot of that review, the incoming Irish Presidency will then assess how best to give effect to those decisions.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Question No. 83, which is being taken with Question No. 8, refers specifically to the London conference of 24 nations, which there is little evidence to suggest had any real effect. I am not arguing in regard to numbers but I understand the annual number for trade unionists killed is about 30 per annum, whereas in 1990-91, the figure was 60. There has been a reduction in the number of assassinations, which must be welcomed.However, the conference laid down what could be regarded as clearly realisable conditions. The EU came in with about €250 million to support Plan Colombia. However, there is not much evidence that it prosecuted the human rights conditionalities. In regard to the culture of murder in Colombia, the evidence is that the Colombian business sector was making regular use, until recently, of private armies to manage assassinations, which was borne out by the ILO.I tabled Question No. 8 at the request of those whose spokespersons have been assassinated in their homes after they tried to organise according to their rights. Lawyers have been threatened and the Sub-committee on Human Rights of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently met a large delegation of eight or nine people, facilitated by Trócaire among others, who presented numerous instances of intimidation and threats. The suggestion is that some of the multinationals which operate in Colombia are making use of the assassination of trade unionists and are impeding organisation. We should use our influence to secure the commitments of the London conference and we should make it clear where we stand through the ILO and our own trade union organisations in solidarity.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	236	We will be better able to gauge the impact of the London declaration beyond December, when the EU will review progress. Since it is a significant donor, I assume it will take those responsibilities seriously.I am aware of allegations that some multinationals are providing support to paramilitary groups. I do not wish to comment on individual cases as I understand some are currently the subject of legal action in other jurisdictions. Ireland and its EU partners have long expressed our outright opposition to the paramilitary groups which perpetrate the majority of killings in Columbia and strongly condemn any support or assistance for terrorist groups such as the AUC or other paramilitaries.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I do not know when is the appropriate time to raise this issue but there are allegations against others regarding training and the introduction into Colombia of training in explosives and weaponry which will be used to kill people, including trade unionists. The number of trade unionists and trade union leaders killed in Colombia is appalling. For reasons of due process I will restrain myself and will not ask the question today. I make no allegations against anyone as I do not know who is responsible, but the issue needs to be raised. Will the Minister inform the House whether it is likely that the trial of Irish people in Colombia will be brought to a close and the matter dealt with? When will issues of this nature be debated in a more open and full way?

Since then the quartet members have maintained contact at official level, both among themselves and with the principal parties to the conflict. A further meeting at ministerial level is envisaged, possibly before the end of this year.I regret to have to state that, to date, neither party has met its obligations under the road map. It is essential that a ceasefire should be re-established quickly and that a package of measures to restart the road map should be implemented by the two sides acting in parallel.As holder of the EU Presidency during the first half of 2004, it will fall to Ireland to represent the European Union within the quartet. I very much hope to see, with the co-operation of the other participants, the road map given new impetus during this period.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I appeal to the Deputy for brevity as we must adjourn at 4.45 p.m.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	242	In many circles the quartet is perceived as being as dead as a doornail. I wish this were not the case. It is sometimes described as the US-supported quartet proposals for peace, which is unhelpful. Does the Minister take hope from the Geneva declaration by those interested in breaking the impasse in the quartet proposals to which he referred? It seems to have been welcomed more widely than expected, even if it is an unofficial document. Will the Minister indicate the Irish and the incoming EU Presidency view on the Geneva proposals?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I agree with an earlier reply of the Minister stating the need to be even-handed in our dealings with the region. I hope I have met that criterion in everything I have said. Will the Minister join me in condemning any suggestion of walling or railing off the West Bank? This would create a prison of the area for the Palestinian people and is so outrageous that it should not be contemplated by any civilised government. Will the Minister confirm that he has raised this matter? Does he see any hope of common sense prevailing and this proposal of the Israeli Government not proceeding?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I have made statements regarding the specific issue raised. The European Union, through Mr. Javier Solana, has continually tried to deal with the issue. Mr. Kofi Annan has raised concerns about realities of activities in the region making the possibility of a two-state solution more difficult, should we get to a negotiating table.I welcome the recent emergence of ideas on a peace plan from the Geneva accord as a development within the context of the quartet road map. I believe the road map contains all the elements for a permanent solution. There is no room for further international initiatives other than the framework of the road map. It confirms that there are people of good faith on both sides who continue to search for peace. They want to indicate, despite the pessimistic outlook of some looking at the situation, that they will continue to try to demonstrate that rational discourse with civil society on both sides is possible.Although only the contents of the draft document have been made public, I am pleased to note that the initiative proposes a solution to final status issues such as the right of return to Palestinians and the division of Jerusalem. I look forward to the publication of the full text of the agreement which I hope will provide an impetus for dialogue and negotiations between the two sides in the conflict.

This matter has been selected for discussion and will be taken now.

The centre performs a simple task. Its members collect clothes and cloth around Dublin for recycling. They supply 70 charity shops around and outside Dublin. Some 65% of the material collected is exported to places such as Pakistan, Africa and so on. From the cotton collected the centre supplies cleaning cloths to companies such as Dublin Bus and print shops.From the end of December this centre will have no facility and will be unable to operate. It will not be able to continue its work and the recyclable material will be put into landfill. This is an environmental project which deserves to be supported. It wants the State to step in with support. This is a drugs task force project which has 52 ring-fenced community employment workers but, without a facility in which to carry out their work, the CE workers cannot be ring-fenced.It would be a great pity, after the debate we have had on waste management, if all this material ended up in a landfill site. That is exactly what will happen if the State does not step in and provide the capital required to buy a building or loan or lease a building to the project on a peppercorn rent.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for sharing his time. I support him on this issue. A large number of those involved in this project are people with special needs whose lives have taken a turn for the better as a result of their work in this facility.A suggestion I made is that we try, with the city council housing and community affairs manager, to see if a joint housing and recycling project could be accommodated on the same site or if a similar site nearby could be provided by the city council and the site concerned be acquired for housing. Some innovative way must be found to assist these people. It would be an appalling tragedy to this needy community if this facility were let go.I do not want to go into the detail because much of it is personal to the participants, many of whom are women who have got their lives back together. Their children attend school locally and they can be seen off to school by their parents who then go to the recycling facility. Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out that many of the recycled clothes go to very poor Third World countries. The recycling centre has the important additional added value through this work of providing for those who are most in need internationally.I appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power, together with the city council and any other agency that can be involved, to ensure that this facility does not go to the wall. The project has been a great saviour to many people and is worthy of support.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I have been asked to reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern. He apologises for being unable to be here.The Deputy should note that the only possible source of funding available to the Minister of State's Department to fund the project in question is the local drugs task force premises initiative. This three-year initiative, covering the period 2001 to 2004, provides capital funding towards the cost of putting in place facilities for the provision of community-based services to drug misusers in local drugs task force areas. This is done either through purchasing or leasing of premises, refurbishment of existing premises or the development of new buildings or sections thereof.Local drugs task forces were invited to submit a list of priority applications to the national drugs strategy team for funding under the initiative. These proposals were assessed by the team, which, in turn, made recommendations to Department for consideration.The Deputy should note that, to date, no recommendation has been received by my Department from the national drugs strategy team on the funding of the Liberties recycling project. Funding of €12.7 million has been provided for the initiative over the three-year period. To date, €11.6 million has been allocated to 38 projects. These projects are at various stages of development and two, in particular, are major projects involving multiple sources of funding where significant shortfalls are likely to arise. In the circumstances, the Department has recommended to the national drugs strategy team that the remaining moneys in the initiative be kept in reserve to cover any additional costs associated with the completion of the projects already approved for funding, in particular the two major projects mentioned above.In this context, the Deputies should also note that a review of the projects being funded under the programme has recently been initiated by the team. This is being done to establish whether there are projects already allocated funding which will not take up their full allocation or which might, for various reasons, not be in a position to proceed. If that is the case and additional moneys were to become available for reallocation, I understand that the team will seek a further list of projects, in order of priority, from the local drugs task forces with a view to making recommendations to the Department for consideration in due course.I am aware of the work being done at this particular project, the Minister of State having visited the site earlier this year, and I understand the particular difficulty in which the promoters now find themselves. That said, however, the Minister of State must reiterate that the premises initiative is the only source of funding currently available to the Department through which the project in question could possibly be funded. It is a matter for the national drugs strategy team to consider the suitability of the project for funding under the initiative and until such time as the Minister of State receives a recommendation from the team, it is not possible for me to make any decision in this regard.I hope the Deputies can use their influence in respect of the strategy team to see if that can be arranged as soon as possible.The Dáil adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 November 2003.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 13 together.The forthcoming Assembly elections, which will take place on Wednesday 26 November, will give the people of Northern Ireland the opportunity to pass their democratic verdict on those who have represented them over the last five years. The elections will also allow them to mandate new representatives to take forward the important work of providing good, accountable government in Northern Ireland. I have every confidence that those elected will exercise their mandates constructively and responsibly, mindful of the need to develop and build on the indisputable progress that has been made since the Good Friday Agreement.I regret that these elections are not taking place in the optimum context that both Governments had hoped for. While substantial progress was made in recent months, it did not prove possible for the relevant parties to reach an agreed basis for the operation of sustainable institutions after the elections. However, I can assure the House that the formation of a sustainable executive, based on cross-community support, will be the first priority of the two Governments after the elections, and we will work closely with the parties to achieve that outcome.As provided for in the validation, implementation and review section of the Agreement, a review conference is due to be convened by the two Governments in December 2003, four years after the Agreement came into effect in December 1999. This conference is required to review and report on the operation of the Agreement. As both Governments emphasised in the Joint Declaration, the review will provide an opportunity for the consideration of a number of issues which have arisen in the course of the implementation of the Agreement. The Joint Declaration also indicated that the Governments would, in consultation with the parties, put forward proposals for the agenda and conduct of the review.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	253	On 1 October 2003, I made a statement to the House concerning the situation in Afghanistan. Since then, the progress towards re-establishing a democratic civil government in Afghanistan has continued. Under the provisions of the Bonn Agreement, the Afghanistan Transitional Authority, ATA, established in June 2002, is to be replaced by an elected government following elections scheduled to take place in June 2004. An electoral commission has been established and the UN mission in Afghanistan has started to organise the electoral process.A draft constitution was published by the ATA on 3 November. The draft was prepared in the first instance by a special constitutional commission, which enjoyed assistance from international experts, and which engaged in an extensive process of consultation, within the constraints imposed by the current security situation. The draft establishes the centrality of Islam, "observes" the United Nations Charter, and "respects" the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It also provides for an office of president and a national assembly. The draft constitution will be debated, possibly amended, and ultimately approved by the Loya Jirga tribal council, which is expected to be convened on 10 December, for some weeks.On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council agreed unanimously to authorise the extension of the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, to 20 December 2004. The Security Council also authorised the expansion of ISAF's mandate to allow it to support the ATA and its successors in the maintenance of security in areas of Afghanistan outside Kabul and its environs. Progress has also been made on the creation of a national police force and reform of the national army. The first battalions of the army have begun military operations alongside coalition forces. The disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process began on 24 October in the northern province of Kunduz.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I am aware of the recent Amnesty International report – Philippines, Something Hanging Over Me: Child Offenders under Sentence of Death, published on 3 October 2003, which lists seven individuals who were all reportedly under the age of 18 at the time of offending. All are under sentence of death, which is contrary both to Philippine and international law. Despite the fact that the law which reintroduced the death penalty makes it clear that it should not be imposed "when the guilty person is below eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the crime," this happens in cases where documentary evidence of the age of the accused may not be available.The Philippines moved against worldwide trends by reintroducing the death penalty in late 1993. It had previously been abolished in 1987. Seven people were executed before President Estrada introduced a moratorium to mark the Christian jubilee year in 2000. President Arroyo continued the de facto moratorium but lifted it in mid-2001. The death penalty was again suspended in September 2002, when a bill for its abolition was presented to congress. This bill has not yet been passed into law. President Arroyo indicated recently that the continuation of the moratorium in cases relating to illegal drugs may be difficult. However, there have been no official announcements of a lifting of the moratorium; neither have any dates been set for new executions.The death sentence may be imposed for a total of 46 crimes, 23 of which incur a mandatory death sentence. Offences incurring a mandatory death sentence include aggravated rape, bribery committed by a public officer, kidnapping for ransom, arson resulting in death and certain drug offences. The death penalty may also be imposed for murder, robbery, treason, piracy and economic plunder.As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland, along with its EU partners, is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty. The EU position on this issue is clearly set out in the EU Guidelines on the Death Penalty, adopted in 1998, which seek the universal abolition of the death penalty. These guidelines state that where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted, including in the cases of juvenile offenders. The Philippines has also yet to accede to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which aims at the abolition of the death penalty.With regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child the EU has consistently urged states that have not yet done so to sign, ratify and fully implement the terms of the convention. The convention unreservedly prohibits the imposition of the death penalty on persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence. As a state party to the convention, the Philippines has undertaken not to impose capital punishment or life imprisonment on juvenile offenders.

The Government do not intend to change this practice. The legal advice confirmed the view of previous Attorneys General that the use of landing and overflight facilities does not constitute participation by Ireland in a military action under international law.

Closing arguments were heard from the prosecutor, the defence and the representative of the procurator general. The three men also appeared in court and made statements. The ambassador to Colombia acted as my official representative at this session and his report has been considered carefully in my Department. The trial has now ended and the decision of the judge is awaited. The Deputy will appreciate that, pending the delivery of the judge's decision, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on this case. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to follow this case closely and to provide all possible consular assistance to the men.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 64 together.For almost 20 years, Ireland has proposed and been the principal sponsor, at both the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights, of a resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. Ireland took on this role because the UN declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance based on religion or belief was adopted at a time when Ireland held the post of chair of the third committee (humanitarian and social affairs) of the General Assembly; Ireland was instrumental in securing the adoption of the declaration in the face of considerable opposition.The resolution aims to address all instances of religious intolerance or discrimination based on religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who are the victims. Sadly, instances of religious intolerance are widespread. They can be found all over the world. We are not just talking about discrimination against Moslems, Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, other world religions, or even non-believers. Frequently, it is a case of discrimination between different branches of the same religion.Accordingly, we have over the years received numerous requests to include mention of specific forms of religious intolerance or discrimination. Until this year, we and the other co-sponsors had consistently maintained that, while the instances in question were indeed matters of great concern to us, to include specific references to them – and not to other instances of the problem – would detract from the universal scope of the resolution. This position of principle had in general been accepted.It has, therefore, been the Government's firm and consistent view that singling out mention of discrimination against a particular faith – be it Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or any other – should be avoided. We do not recognise a hierarchy in the incorrectness of religious intolerance, even though we readily acknowledge that at certain moments of history members of particular faiths have been singled out for the most savage and extreme persecution. Nobody should deny that this has all too often been the fate of those who follow the Jewish faith.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The financing of military and civilian crisis management operations has been an important issue since the outset of European security and defence policy ESDP. It has also proved to be particularly important in the context of specific ESDP operations such as the EU police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the EU's military monitoring and stabilisation mission in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the EU's military assistance mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The importance of an appropriate financing mechanism in each case has derived from the need for the EU to be able to respond effectively to operational requirements, while at the same ensuring that the proper budgetary checks and balances are maintained.The legal base for expenditure which is laid down in Title V of the Treaty on European Union makes a distinction between administrative expenditure and operational expenditure. Article 28 of the treaty states that operational expenditure having military or defence implications may not be charged to the Community budget. Instead, and unless the Council unanimously decides otherwise, such expenditure shall be charged to the member states in accordance with the GNP scale. Article 28(3) of the Treaty on European Union provides that constructively abstaining member states making a formal declaration under article 23(1) of the treaty shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing of an operation.In the case of the EU police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the forthcoming EU police mission in FYROM, and in accordance with the treaty, common costs are being met out of the European Commission-administered budget for the common Foreign and Security Policy. To date, costs of mission allowances for participating personnel have fallen to be met by the respective sending states.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	259	In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September, the Taoiseach strongly supported the call made by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to the international community to tackle the fundamental policy issues and structural changes needed in the United Nations if it is to deal effectively with global issues, particularly those of international peace and security. Secretary General Annan, in his own address to the General Assembly, pointed to the need for the Security Council to regain the confidence of states and of world public opinion by demonstrating its ability to deal effectively with the most difficult issues and by becoming more broadly representative of the international community as a whole, as well as of the geopolitical realities of today. He also stated that the General Assembly needed reform to ensure that important issues were not, as he put it, crowded out by repetitive and sterile debates.The Taoiseach and his fellow Heads of Government committed themselves to a reform of the United Nations three years ago in the millennium declaration. The General Assembly, in 2002, adopted a comprehensive resolution on strengthening the UN system and significant progress has been made in implementing it. One area of undoubted progress has been the major reforms undertaken in UN peacekeeping operations, which Ireland, as a permanent contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations, greatly welcomes. The Secretary General has also made substantial progress in bringing about much needed reform in the areas under his own competence, particularly in the management and structure of the secretariat.Fundamental institutional questions remain to be tackled, however. On 4 November, the Secretary General announced the formation and composition of a high-level panel on threats, challenges and change. The 16 member panel, to be chaired by the former prime minister of Thailand, Anand Panyarachun, is mandated to analyse future challenges to international peace and security and recommend clear and practical measures for ensuring effective collective action. The members have been selected in an individual capacity as eminent persons in the field of international relations and not as representatives of their countries. By the next General Assembly, the member states should have a set of proposals drawn up by the panel and the Government greatly welcomes this. The creation of the panel does not absolve the member states from continuing to work towards United Nations reform.The effort to revitalise the General Assembly to date has largely focused on streamlining its agenda and procedures to promote a more efficient and less repetitive approach to its work. Progress in this area has been slow and incremental and requires persistence, particularly on the part of the President of the General Assembly whose difficult task it is to secure the agreement of the member states for change. I have assured the President, Foreign Minister Hunte of St. Lucia, that, like his predecessors, he will have Ireland's full support in his efforts to bring about a more effective General Assembly. During Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, we will work to marshal effective support on the part of the EU and its member states for the reform process.

The European Union was represented in Presidency Troika format – that is, by the Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Berlusconi, the Secretary General-High Representative, Mr. Solana, and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi. President Putin represented the Russian Federation. The agenda consisted of five items: EU-Russia relations; building the four spaces; developments in Russia; developments in the EU and international issues.The summit specifically sought to make progress on the four spaces between the EU and Russia which were agreed at the St. Petersburg summit on 31 May 2003 – common economic space, space of external security, space of internal security, and education and culture. The summit agreed to intensify and focus efforts to fulfil the decision to create these common spaces. It also endorsed the work to date of the high level group on the common European economic space and agreed to continue this work, taking full account of the recommendations of the HLG report with a view to achieving tangible results as soon as possible.The summit also reaffirmed the joint commitment of the EU and Russia to implement, as soon as possible and in full, the package on Kaliningrad agreed in November 2002, including the launch of a high-speed train feasibility study before the end of 2003. The summit noted both the success of EU-Russia co-operation in the facilitation of the transit of Russian citizens and positive developments in the field of customs co-operation. The summit also took note of the fourth progress report on the energy dialogue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I refer the Deputy to my reply of 16 October 2003 regarding this matter. As I noted then, primary responsibility for research matters at both national and EU level lies with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. On 18 September 2003, the European Commission announced proposals for a so-called preparatory action aimed at encouraging research in the area of security. The safety and security of EU citizens is clearly a matter of central importance to the Governments of the member states. Any effort to improve the security of citizens must be seen in that light.In making the announcement, attention was drawn by Commissioners Busquin and Liikanen to the perceived need for a more structured approach to this issue at EU level, to genuine security needs of citizens across the EU and to the importance of ensuring value for money in relation to the funding of security research. I understand that a further communication from the European Commission on this matter is expected. This, together with the proposals already announced, will require careful consideration and will be the subject of discussion at EU level.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 49 and 99 together.The human rights situation in Uganda has greatly improved since the fall of the Obote regime in 1986 and the subsequent election of President Museveni. Uganda has ratified all six major international human rights instruments and has a human rights commission. Most Ugandans now live in security, although there are areas for continuing improvement. In particular, the plight of the local population in northern Uganda is a situation of grave concern to the Irish Government and the EU.For the past 17 years, northern Uganda has suffered from attacks by the rebel group, Lord's Resistance Army, which has seen up to 20,000 children abducted by the LRA to act as child soldiers and sex slaves. These attacks have escalated dramatically in the past few months. The consequences for the Acholi people of the region have been devastating, with internal displacement of up to 80% of the people. The Ugandan Government's response is still predominantly focused on a military defeat of the LRA, although success to date has proved elusive.The Irish Government has condemned, and continues to condemn the appalling atrocities committed by the LRA. In October 2003, Development Co-operation Ireland approved funding of €500,000 for emergency feeding programs for internally displaced persons and refugees in northern and western Uganda. At a recent meeting in Kampala between the EU Troika and the Ugandan Foreign Minister, at which Ireland was represented, the EU condemned the human rights abuses perpetrated by the LRA and urged the Ugandan Government to also consider non-military solutions to resolve this terrible situation. To this end, the EU expressed support for the Acholi religious leaders peace initiative as an important channel of communication with the LRA.Deputies will be aware that President Museveni of Uganda visited Ireland this week and met with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, as well as the Taoiseach and President McAleese. The opportunity presented by the visit was used to discuss a wide variety of issues of mutual concern to both countries, including the internal political situation in Uganda. The Ugandan Government has committed itself to a return to multi-party elections in 2006 and this was warmly welcomed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	263	On 5 November 2003, I gave a comprehensive response in relation to the sixth EU-China summit meeting and related matters. The summit was hosted by the Chinese Premier, Mr. Wen Jiabao, in Beijing on 30 October 2003. The EU was represented by Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy, in his capacity as President of the European Council and by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, and the High Representative for EU Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr. Javier Solana. In line with EU convention in these matters, individual member states were represented by the Presidency at the summit.Ongoing EU concerns regarding the situation in Tibet were addressed, as well as the general human rights situation in China, both bilaterally, within the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue and through appropriate action at the UN, including at the commission on human rights. While Tibet was not agreed upon as a separate agenda item for the summit, the EU-China human rights dialogue, international human rights standards and UN human rights mechanisms were all the subject of discussion. As these are the frameworks through which the EU continues to address the Tibet question, the discussions at the EU-China Summit on these issues were of particular relevance and interest with regard to the situation in that region.At the summit, the parties welcomed the achievements of the EU-China human rights dialogue, and reconfirmed their commitment to work towards achieving more meaningful and positive results on the ground. The joint expression of commitment to further enhance co-operation in the field of human rights is welcome in this regard. I would like to assure the Deputy that, within the existing frameworks, Ireland will continue to call on the Chinese authorities to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people.

Ireland was represented at the meeting by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche. However, I appeared before the Joint Committee on European Affairs on Wednesday, 8 October 2003 for an exchange of views on the Council's agenda and, following the Council, my Department forwarded the relevant conclusions prepared by the Council Secretariat to the Committee for information. These are also available on the following internet address: www.europa.eu.int/comm/externalrelations/gacIn accordance with its usual practice, the Council met in two sessions, one dealing with general affairs and the other dealing with external relations. In the general affairs session the Council took note of a Presidency report on recent meetings of the Agriculture, Justice and Home Affairs and ECOFIN Councils. The Council also discussed the Presidency's annotated agenda for the European Council of 16-17 October which focused on relaunching the European economy, strengthening the area of freedom, justice and security and external relations. A request from the President of the European Parliament for issues linked to the statute for members of the European Parliament to be reviewed by the Intergovernmental Conference was discussed. The Presidency concluded that while the Council was favourable to a discussion with the Parliament on these issues they were not in favour of submitting them to the Intergovernmental Conference.The Council addressed a wide range of issues in the session on external relations and adopted conclusions in relation to wider Europe, Iraq, the western Balkans and Iran. Ministers had an in-depth exchange of views on the situation in the Middle East in order to prepare for the discussion on this item at the European Council. The Council also held an exchange of views on the EU-Russia Summit due to be held in Rome on 6 November 2003.In addition to these issues, a number of items were discussed under any other business, namely: Democratic Republic of Congo/International Criminal Court, the Great Lakes region, Afghanistan and Moldova.A ministerial meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference also took place in the margins of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, at which the composition of the Commission, the proposed European Union Foreign Minister post and preparation of the European Council on 16-17 October were discussed.Meetings of the Association Council with Jordan and the European Economic Area Council took place in the margins of the Council. In addition, an agreement was signed between the Community and the Special Administrative region of Macao on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation

Discussions focused on Ireland's support for the UN Office for Drugs and Crime –€500,000 in 2003; the issues of reform and management of UNODC under Mr Costa; the work of the Office and in particular the current situation in relation to opium production in Afghanistan. The Minister of State outlined the details of the forthcoming Dublin International Conference on HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia which will take place next February. The Minister issued an invitation to Mr. Costa to attend the conference and Mr. Costa accepted.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Ireland recognises the need for the European Union to have effective planning and headquarters arrangements for crisis management operations. However, the proposal for an independent EU planning capability put forward by France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg at their "mini-summit" on 29 April last, as well as other related ideas raised by partners, will require further discussion before decisions can be reached in this area. As a general principle, Ireland would be cautious about any proposals that could result in significantly increased military expenditure and, where feasible, we would favour minimising duplication of military resources and capabilities. In addition, we consider that any future proposals should be consistent with the nature of European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, as it has developed to date. Any proposals should also be in accordance with agreed principles which govern the established framework for EU-NATO relations. Of central importance from Ireland's perspective are principles guaranteeing the autonomy of both organisations and preventing discrimination against any member of the EU. We also attach particular importance to proposals in the ESDP area being taken forward in an inclusive and transparent manner.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	270	To date in 2003, the total amount of humanitarian and recovery assistance approved by the Government for Palestine, Afghanistan, Congo and Liberia amounts to more than €9 million. So far this year, development assistance totalling €2.9 million, including emergency humanitarian relief, has been provided for Palestine. In delivering this aid, the Government's objective has been to alleviate the practical consequences of the ongoing conflict by enhancing the capacity of our partners, in particular the Palestinian Authority, to respond to the crisis and to address the future development needs of the Palestinian people. Of this support for Palestine, €1 million has been provided to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, for its humanitarian programme. Despite the ongoing conflict and widespread infrastructure destruction, UNRWA's operations in the areas of health, education and basic services continue, often at great personal risk to staff. Development Co-operation Ireland has also delivered €260,000 to Trócaire for an emergency water and employment programme in Palestine.In Afghanistan, Ireland continues to actively support the recovery process and to deliver on the pledge we made at the international conference on Afghanistan which took place in Tokyo in January 2002. The Government pledged €12 million over a three year period for recovery activities in Afghanistan. Of this, almost €9.4 million has been delivered or approved for delivery to date. In addition, we have provided support amounting to €2.8 million for humanitarian operations in Afghanistan from 2002 to date.In the Democratic Republic of Congo, so far in 2003, humanitarian funding of €1.1 million has been allocated in support of emergency water and health relief. Some €500,000 was provided to UNICEF to support its emergency water and sanitation programme, €350,000 was allocated to Médecins Sans Frontieres, MSF, for basic health care provision and €250,000 was disbursed to the World Health Organisation for the provision of inoculations and other primary health care activities.Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to the latest crisis in Liberia. On 22 August last, I announced an emergency humanitarian package of assistance amounting to €2 million for Liberia. This aid is concentrated on urgent provision of water deliveries, food assistance and emergency health supplies to the displaced population and is being disbursed through UN agencies as well as Irish and international NGOs. This funding was a follow up to Development Co-operation Ireland's €500,000 humanitarian package for Liberia in January 2003, delivered via the UN World Food Programme and UNICEF.All of this humanitarian assistance is designed to meet our key goal of saving and protecting lives in the developing world. This objective is underscored by a number of best practice humanitarian principles: a commitment to international humanitarian law and respect for human rights; adhering to needs-based programming; supporting emergency preparedness and building local capacity; promoting the unique co-ordinating role of the United Nations; and promoting strategic interventions as part of a co-ordinated donor response, particularly with our EU partners.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	271	There are no plans to organise a conference of this kind. It should go without saying that the Government favours continuing dialogue among cultures in order to improve mutual understanding. Appropriate structures already exist for carrying forward such dialogue. One specific initiative being undertaken by the EU is the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for a Dialogue of Cultures. The Euro-Mediterranean mid-term ministerial in Crete on 26 and 27 May 2003 agreed on the establishment of this foundation. One of the foundation's guiding principles notes that "the values of dialogue, tolerance and respect for the other, which are common to all religions, constitute an important factor in bringing closer together cultures and civilisations".The foundation for a dialogue of cultures should become a catalyst for all initiatives aimed at increasing dialogue and common understanding on the basis of the guiding principles for the dialogue between cultures and civilisations. We are currently exploring how we might make a concrete contribution to the establishment of the foundation. I look forward to further discussions on the foundation at the euro-mediterranean ministerial in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003.Ireland has previously supported initiatives in the field of cultural understanding. The United Nations General Assembly designated 2001 as the United Nations year of dialogue among civilisations. Ireland took an active role in this when it hosted a meeting of the eminent persons group appointed to report on dialogue among civilisations in Dublin on 30 and 31 May 2001.

However, I can assure the Deputy that the issues raised in that report have been drawn to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, whose Department has operational responsibility for the Peace II Programme. Where action is required, that action is being taken forward by the managing authority for the programme, the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB. The body operates under the direction of both Departments of Finance, North and South, who liaise closely on all matters related to the Peace II Programme.

Meeting the basic human needs of some of the poorest people in the world and improving their access to food, water, health services, sanitation, education and employment are key goals of the programme, at both bilateral and multilateral level.The main geographical focus of the bilateral programme is Sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world. Within the framework of three year country strategy papers, CSPs, Development Co-operation Ireland provides long-term development assistance to seven programme countries, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda and Zambia, as well as South Africa. In line with other donors, we operate in partnership with the Governments of these countries and agree our strategies with them to ensure that our interventions respond effectively to their development needs. We help to build up the capacity of these Governments to manage their own affairs, which in turn strengthens their sense of ownership of the whole development process.

At the April 2003 meeting of the EU External Relations Council, Ireland, together with our EU partners, adopted revised Council conclusions on Indonesia, confirming the EU support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia.The question of a review of UN conduct with the Act of Free Choice in Papua, would require the support of UN member states. Enquiries, made at my request by our Permanent Representative to the UN, confirm that, at present, there is no significant support for such an initiative. There is, moreover, concern that such an approach might prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the Indonesian Government, and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the Papuan people.

The proposals were welcomed, and the High Representative was tasked by the European Council to bring work forward with a view to submitting a text for approval at the December European Council in Brussels. Following detailed discussion of the proposals in a series of seminars, a revised draft of the strategy will be presented to Foreign Ministers at next week's Council on General Affairs and External Relations Council. The strategy will then be due for adoption at the level of heads of state and government in December.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Amnesty International and other human rights organisations have long expressed serious concern about widespread human rights abuses in Mexico, including disappearances, killings, torture by police, arbitrary detentions, death threats and ill-treatment by prison and military authorities.The Amnesty International report, Intolerable Killings: 10 years of Abductions and Murders of Women in Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua, published on 11 August 2003, focuses on the horrific violence against women in Chihuahua state. According to the report, in the last ten years, approximately 370 women have been murdered in Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua, of which at least 137 were sexually assaulted prior to their death. Some NGOs believe the figures may even be higher. The report expressed concern about the Mexican authorities' failure to address the murder of the young women, stating that the authorities, both within the state of Chihuahua and at the federal level, have been unwilling to recognise the extent of the pattern of violence against women and to implement effective policies for dealing with it.A February 2003 report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also addressed the right of women in Ciudad Juárez to be free from violence and discrimination. This followed a visit at the invitation of the Mexican Government by Inter-American Commission on Human Rights special rapporteur on the rights of women, Ms Marta Altolaguirre, to Ciudad Juárez and to Mexico City. A series of meetings have since been held between the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Mexican Government to follow up on the report.The question of the respective competencies between the federal and the local level has complicated matters. The federal government has recently taken a more active role following evidence of federal offences.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	280	The overarching objective of the Government's overseas development assistance programme is poverty reduction in the worlds poorest countries. Development Co-operation Ireland is contributing to the international community's effort to meet the key millennium development goal of halving by 2015 the number of people, currently 1.2 billion, who are living on less than $1 per day.Securing the objective of poverty reduction requires a strong and vibrant private sector capable of generating the national wealth that underpins health and education programmes. In many of the countries where the Government has bilateral programmes, the private sector is undeveloped, lacks investment funding, management expertise and technological know-how. A strategy to guide the support we provide for the development of a strong private sector in developing countries is now in preparation.There is a need to strengthen the dialogue and partnership between the Government's development co-operation programme and the private sector in Ireland. Without departing from our traditional policy of providing untied aid, there is considerable scope for a partnership with the Irish private sector to promote the achievement of our development objectives. Irish companies, both indigenous and multinational, are increasingly globalised. Many Irish companies are now investing in, receiving supplies from or actively exploring business possibilities in emerging economies in the developing world. At the same time, the Government's aid programme has many years of experience in dealing with the opportunities and challenges associated with operating in poor countries.I have decided, in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, to establish a private sector forum. The forum will facilitate dialogue and co-operation between Development Co-operation Ireland and the Irish private sector. It should in time lead to partnerships between Development Co-operation Ireland and the private sector in Ireland in support of the private sector in developing countries.I want the forum to address issues such as the opportunities and challenges for Irish companies in trading with and investing in developing countries; the scope for partnerships between Development Co-operation Ireland and the private sector in areas such as information and communications technology, food processing and financial services; the developing country perspective on global trade issues such as market access, subsidies and trade barriers; the technical, legal and trade issues associated with the supply of life-saving medicines, including anti-retrovirals against HIV/AIDS, to developing countries; corporate social responsibility in developing countries, including issues such as labour rights and child workers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The task force on policy regarding Irish emigrants was established in December 2001 on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. The purpose of the task force was to develop a coherent, long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs.The task force presented its report to me at the end of August 2002. The report contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching proposals. I welcomed the report which, I believe, sets the issue of emigrants in a forward-looking context and provides a template for addressing the needs of the Irish abroad in the future.Following receipt of the task force report, I established an inter-departmental working group to consider the task force's recommendations with a view to the submission of proposals for further action to the Government. The inter-departmental working group has met on a number of occasions and I expect to receive their report before Christmas.In the meantime, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that I have been able to make provision for an additional €1 million at this stage for services to emigrants in the Estimates for my Department in 2004.The additional provision next year represents a 33% increase in the funding provided by my Department for these services. This is a further step in the implementation of the recommendations of the task force. It confirms the Government's commitment to address the needs of the Irish abroad, and particularly those who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion.I intend that the additional funds will be concentrated on improving services for the more vulnerable among our emigrants who require special assistance and support. The majority of these people emigrate to the UK. My first priority, therefore, will be to provide for a substantial increase in the DION fund next year.

In line with this policy, the national declaration specified that Ireland is not party to any mutual defence commitment, that we are not party to any plans to develop a European army and that Ireland will take its own sovereign decision on whether Irish troops should participate in humanitarian or crisis management tasks mounted by the EU, based on the requirements set out in relevant national legislation of UN endorsement, Government decision and Dáil approval.The declaration also made clear that Ireland will not adopt any decision taken by the European Council to move to a common defence or ratify any future treaty which would involve a departure from our traditional policy of military neutrality unless it has first been approved by the Irish people in a referendum.This approach was endorsed by the electorate in the October 2002 referendum on the Nice treaty and has since informed the Government's approach to all relevant discussions on security and defence issues at EU level, including in the context of the ongoing Intergovernmental conference.Ireland's national statement at Seville was accompanied by a supporting statement by the European Council. Together, these two documents have confirmed, both from a national perspective and from that of the European Council, that our traditional policy of military neutrality is fully understood and respected by all our EU partners, as well as by organisations such as NATO. I am happy to confirm that this position has been upheld throughout all of my contacts with EU partners on security and defence issues.Against this background, I consider that most advantageous position for Ireland in respect of the areas outlined by Deputy Durkan remains as set out in our national declaration put forward at the Seville European Council.

During the Irish Presidency, it is planned to hold an EU-US summit in Ireland and we are working closely with the US side to agree a date.The Government attaches considerable importance to the EU's relationship with the US, which is comprehensive, covering a broad range of political as well as trade and economic issues. While it is too early to indicate in detail the topics for discussion during the summit, it would be our expectation that issues relating to foreign policy, economic and trade relations and other areas for co-operation will arise for consideration.The EU-US relationship is of fundamental importance to both parties and the Government is committed to working closely with the US during our Presidency to further develop co-operation across a broad range of issues.

The key focus of this support has been on basic health services, water and sanitation, food assistance and help for internally displaced persons. Ireland's funding has been delivered via the Red Cross family, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, Concern, GOAL, Trócaire and the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).Emergency and recovery assistance is delivered through a number of funding channels in order to provide maximum flexibility of response. The emergency and recovery budgets for 2003 stand at €23 million and €12 million respectively. In addition, emergency funding is provided as necessary from other budget lines such as the programme countries.While the 2003 outturns will not be available until early 2004, it is anticipated that funding to Iraq during 2003 will amount to less than 14% of funds delivered for emergency and postemergency recovery operations.At the recent Madrid Donors Conference on Reconstruction in Iraq, Ireland pledged up to €3 million for humanitarian and recovery needs in Iraq over the next 18 months. This assistance will be provided through valued partners such as UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs. Discussions will take place over the coming months with these partner organisations, to examine sectors and priorities on a needs basis.More than €28 million has been approved to date in 2003 for emergency and post-emergency recovery programmes in other countries worldwide, the details of which are contained in a table below.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Conscious of the success of the sponsorship arrangements in recent Presidencies, and the fact that this has very much become the norm, the Government took the view that the Presidency offers a valuable and important opportunity for Irish business to promote what is best about Ireland, in particular in the economic, trade and tourism areas.The main role of the Presidency is to advance the agenda of the European Union but it is also the case that the Presidency of the day takes the opportunity to promote its country. It would be remiss of the Government if we did not maximise the exposure Ireland will gain from hosting the Presidency, which may well be the last of its kind. I also believe that sponsorship will help develop a wider ownership of, and involvement with, the Presidency.We have, in particular, modelled our approach on that applied by the very successful Danish Presidency by inviting offers of sponsorship from companies. All sponsorship will be in the form of goods and services – no cash sponsorship will be considered.There are a number of categories that particularly lend themselves to a sponsorship arrangement – transportation, catering, the provision of IT/telecommunications equipment and gifts in general. Similar categories have been sponsored during previous Presidencies. In this context, my Department contacted the various umbrella groups for business in Ireland, such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotel Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to outline the sponsorship possibilities.We are encouraged by the number of companies who have expressed interest in sponsorship. However, as negotiations with these parties are ongoing, I am not in a position at this stage to give details of the value of these offers. Prior to entering into a contract, all offers for sponsorship are being presented to the interdepartmental Presidency planning group, which will then decide on the appropriate sponsorship arrangements.I am confident that when complete, not only will the costs of hosting the Presidency be reduced but there will be a framework in place which will maximise the exposure of Irish products to a wider European and international audience. This can only be of real benefit to the country.

The meeting allowed a full and useful exchange of views on these questions.The European Commission's proposal for the funding of embryo stem cell research in limited circumstances is to be the subject of a debate in the European Parliament next week and of discussion at the forthcoming meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 27 November, at which Ireland will be represented by the Tánaiste.The Taoiseach and I explained the Government's broad approach to funding for embryonic stem cell research which, primarily, has been to ensure that funding would not be available for research in Ireland which is not compatible with our law and ethical guidelines. Ireland supported the current moratorium at EU level on funding for such research and is anxious to see the greatest possible safeguards applying even in those member states where such research is legal and considered ethical.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, on 16 June agreed a set of basic principles for an EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, together with an action plan for their implementation. The action plan was subsequently endorsed by the European Council which declared its development and implementation to be a matter of priority. The Thessaloniki European Council also issued a declaration on WMD and envisaged that a formal EU strategy to address the threat of proliferation would be completed by the end of the year.Progress has been made by the EU towards a number of goals pursuant to the action plan. These include progressing the scope of international export control regimes, supporting the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, improving co-operative threat reduction with the Russian Federation, reviewing EU export controls in preparation for accession and strengthening multi-lateralism in the fight against WMD proliferation.GAERC, on 17 and 18 November next, will hear a comprehensive progress report on developments since Thessaloniki, detailing fully all the work carried out by the Union to date. Ireland has traditionally been active in the non-proliferation and disarmament field and is supportive of efforts to give the EU a higher profile in this area. We believe that the basic principles and action plan agreed in June have provided a useful basis for discussion and action at every level within the Union on this issue. We look forward to working with partners on this important issue during our Presidency of the EU next year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The values which must inform the European Union's activities in its external actions are set out in Article I-3 of the draft Constitutional Treaty under which the Union is obliged to "contribute to peace, solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and protection of human rights and in particular children's rights, as well as to the strict observance and development of international law, including respect for the United Nations Charter". The Government has welcomed this clear statement of principle, believing that it is fully consistent with the values and beliefs of the Irish people.These values are further elaborated in article III-193 of the draft treaty, which sets out the broad framework of the Union's external actions, and in article III-218, which makes specific provision for the Union's activity in the area of development co-operation. The latter, in particular, states clearly that "Union development co-operation policy shall have as its primary aim the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty. The Union shall take account of the objectives of development co-operation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries".The draft treaty, therefore, makes it explicitly clear that the Union's principal aim in its approach to the developing world is the eradication of poverty and that all policies that could have an impact on developing countries must be consistent with that approach. The focus on the eradication of poverty, and the need to test Union policies against this aim, is fully consistent with the Irish Government's approach.The new treaty also, for the first time, provides a legal base for emergency humanitarian aid. Article III-223 states clearly that all such operations "shall be conducted in compliance with the principles of international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of impartiality and non-discrimination". The articles that Dóchas cites refer to the implementation of the Union's Common Security and Defence Policy, including the Petersberg Tasks, and are specific to that area. They do not make development assistance a resource in the conduct of security policy.

Ireland, together with our EU partners adheres to the ‘one China' policy. As such, the Government does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.For several years, Taiwan has been lobbying to be accepted as a member of the World Health Organisation, WHO. As Taiwan has not succeeded in securing membership of the WHO, it has sought observer status at the organisation's annual world health assembly, WHA. In previous years, the assembly has not included the issue of Taiwan as an item on its agenda.Ireland has been, and remains, fully committed to the ‘one China' policy. We do not therefore support Taiwanese membership of organisations where statehood is a prerequisite for membership, and take the view that any status granted to Taiwan by the WHO must be compatible with the ‘one China' policy.

Every effort is being made to provide the resources needed to work towards that target. Despite the many pressures on the public finances at present, an allocation of €399 million is to be made in 2004 to my Department's Vote for international co-operation. In addition, elements of ODA which are administered by other Departments are expected to total some €80 million next year. Total spending on ODA, therefore, is expected to approach €480 million in 2004, the highest ever in the history of the programme. This level of expenditure in difficult budgetary circumstances demonstrates the profound commitment of the Government to the attainment of the UN target.In 2001, our aid expenditure amounted to 0.33% of GNP. This year it is likely to reach 0.41%. Next year it is likely to reach the same level or possibly exceed it. In percentage terms, Ireland will remain one of the world's leading donors. We are currently in seventh place, and well ahead of the EU average. The Government hopes that increased allocations, the scale and timing of which will be considered on an ongoing basis, will be possible over the coming years with a view to the achievement of our objective.

While a ceasefire has been in place for some time between the parties, the conflict in the Western Sahara has given rise to serious humanitarian issues which remain unresolved, including the situation of the Saharawi refugees in Algeria. The Government played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during its term on the Security Council.On 31 July 2003 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1495 which extended the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, until 31 October 2003. It also recommended the acceptance by all sides of the Baker plan II which proposes a transitional period of four to five years during which Western Sahara would be self-governing under Moroccan sovereignty. A Western Sahara Authority, WSA, under a chief executive would be responsible for local government, internal security, law enforcement, the economy, welfare and education, while Morocco would be responsible for foreign relations, national security and defence. At the end of five years a referendum would be held giving residents a choice between independence, integration with Morocco or continued autonomy. Algeria and the Polisario front have indicated their willingness to explore the proposals. Morocco continues to reject them.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	295	The World Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal, in April 2000 adopted six major goals for education, which are referred to as "Education for all", or EFA. Of these goals, two also became millennium development goals later in the same year. The Dakar framework for action declared that by 2015 all children of primary school age would participate in free schooling of good quality and that gender disparities in schooling would be eliminated. The gender goal was judged to be particularly urgent. It requires the achievement of parity in enrolments for girls and boys at primary and secondary levels by 2005. Levels of illiteracy are to be halved and early childhood care and education and learning opportunities for youth and adults greatly increased. It is intended that all aspects of education quality will be improved.Monitoring of progress towards the goals is carried out by all the signatories to the Dakar framework. It is also monitored independently through the EFA global monitoring report which is prepared by a team of experts based at UNESCO headquarters. The report is the most comprehensive survey of education trends worldwide. I am pleased to announce that funding for the next three years for this report will be provided from the Development Co-operation Ireland budget. The report for 2003 tracks progress towards the achievement of the goals and focuses particularly on measuring progress toward the goal of gender equality. Launched last week in New Delhi, it concludes that while there has been some progress, this has been slow and that there are still enormous challenges.The Report indicates that almost 60% of countries are likely to miss achieving gender parity by 2005, though in a good number of countries policies are available that are capable of delivering parity within a few years. More worryingly, 54 out of 128 countries are at risk of not achieving gender parity by 2015. These are mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The report outlines the multiple challenges to be met if education for all is to be secured. The overriding obstacle to participation in education continues to be poverty. In our six programme countries in Africa we are fully committed to education for all and to supporting ministries of education to accelerate progress towards the goals.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I would not characterise the differing views on the International Criminal Court, ICC, held by the United States of America and the European Union and other supporters of the ICC as a dispute. The United States has approached a large number of states seeking to conclude bilateral agreements under Article 98(2) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to prohibit the surrender of its nationals to the court. These are generally referred to as "bilateral non-surrender agreements".The European Union has analysed the terms of the agreements sought by the US and has concluded that in creating classes of immune persons it goes beyond what is permitted by the Rome statute. The EU has drawn up guidelines – the guiding principles – on what such agreements must contain or avoid to be compatible with the statute. As part of its activities in promoting the effective functioning of the ICC, the EU has drawn these guiding principles to the attention of states party to the Rome statute which are contemplating the conclusion of a bilateral non-surrender agreement. This activity has not been undertaken to prevent the US or any other state from seeking to pursue the conclusion of bilateral non-surrender agreements. It has been conducted solely in the context of the EU's support for the ICC and the integrity of the Rome statute.The US, however, maintains that the Rome statute or bilateral non-surrender agreements which conform to it in accordance with the EU guiding principles do not provide sufficient protection to its personnel from the threat of politically motivated prosecutions. I am not aware that any of the EU accession states has signed a bilateral non-surrender agreement.

It currently stands at 148, comprising 94 permanent posts and 54 contract posts. In addition, a number of staff are employed locally by embassies in our programme countries to assist with programme implementation and monitoring, accounting and audit functions and the provision of security and other support services. Staffing levels for the programme will be kept under review as the budget for Ireland's development co-operation programme expands.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Ireland has long pursued a policy of support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, and attaches the utmost importance to its universalisation. India, Pakistan and Israel are the only three countries that have not acceded to the NPT. Ireland will continue to avail of every opportunity to call for their adherence to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states as an EU member and within the New Agenda Coalition, NAC.In the EU's opening statement at the United Nations General Assembly first committee, the EU called for full compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1172 which, inter alia, calls on India and Pakistan to accede as non-nuclear weapon states to the NPT. The statement also called on Israel to accede as a non-nuclear weapon state. The NAC, of which Ireland is a founder member, presented a paper to the last NPT preparatory commission in April 2003. This identified the need for the international community to redouble its efforts in persuading these countries to accede without further delay. Most recently, at the UN first committee, Ireland co-sponsored the NAC resolution, Towards a Nuclear Free World: A New Agenda, which called on these three states to accede to the treaty promptly and without condition as non-nuclear weapon states.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Croatia presented its application for membership of the EU on 20 February 2003. At its meeting on 14 April 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council asked the Commission to prepare a formal opinion on the application, as required under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union. The Commission expects to deliver its opinion next spring, during Ireland's EU Presidency. The Government has welcomed the Croatian application and Ireland as Presidency will facilitate consideration by the Council of the Commission opinion.Croatia's application will be assessed on the basis of the Copenhagen political criteria for candidate states and in the context of the implementation of commitments under the stabilisation and association agreement concluded with the EU in 2001. The political criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 stipulate that a candidate country must achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. Issues of particular importance in Croatia's case will be progress in the wide-ranging institutional reform process, the implementation of measures to enable the return of refugees from the conflicts of the 1990s, and the level of co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 decided that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the political criteria which apply to all candidate countries. The European Council last December made the clear commitment that if the European Council meeting in December 2004 decides that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations without delay. This decision will be taken on the basis of a report and recommendation by the Commission.

We welcome the recent emergence of ideas on a peace plan as a development within that context. It demonstrates that rational discourse from civil society on both sides is possible.Although the contents of the draft document have been made public only unofficially, the fact that the initiative discusses solutions to final status issues, such as the right of return of Palestinians and the future of Jerusalem is very positive. As Presidency of the European Union during the first semester of 2004, Ireland will work with the other members of the international Quartet to advance the implementation of the roadmap and the fulfilment by both sides of their obligations under that plan. Contacts between political and civil society elements from both sides which advance the aims of the roadmap are to be welcomed.

Some 70 of the temporary posts are based in the political and European Union divisions of the Department. These divisions are tasked with ensuring that the EU's internal and external agendas are managed successfully during Ireland's Presidency. A total of 30 additional officers have also been temporarily assigned to the permanent representation to the EU in Brussels, in addition to approximately 40 officers assigned there for the Presidency by other Government Departments.Many of the temporary posts have been filled by officers on Civil Service Commission promotion panels who are awaiting new permanent assignments. After the Presidency, they will be appointed to their new Departments or, if they have not been assigned in the meantime, will return to their parent Departments. Other temporary posts have been filled by officers who have been permanently or temporarily redeployed to the Department from other Departments and offices, by interns or temporary clerical staff at HQ or locally employed by missions and by officers who have returned from career breaks or special leave.The Department of Foreign Affairs budget for 2003 includes a provision of €12 million for Presidency-related commitments. The Presidency budget for the Department for 2004 will be €25 million.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The EU-Chile Association Agreement is a mixed competence agreement, in other words, some aspects of the agreement fall within the competence of the Commission, others within the competence of member states. The bulk of the trade chapter, the institutional framework of the agreement and the trade-related co-operation provisions, which fall under the competence of the Commission, have been provisionally applied since 1 February 2003. The remaining provisions – political dialogue chapter, some parts of the trade chapter such as services, establishment, current payments and capital movements, intellectual property rights and the bulk of the co-operation provisions – will enter into force once all of the 15 member states of the EU have ratified the agreement, in accordance with their domestic procedures. The European Parliament gave its assent to the agreement at its plenary session of 12 February 2003.Chile ratified the agreement on 28 January 2003. Following approval of the terms of the agreement by Dáil Éireann on 17 June 2003, Ireland ratified the agreement on 30 June. Denmark did so on 27 June 2003 and the United Kingdom on the 9 July 2003. Ratification procedures in the other EU member states are in progress. During our EU Presidency in the first half of 2004, we will encourage other member states to advance their national ratifications.The first meeting of the EU-Chile Association committee will take place next month in Brussels from December 10 to 12. In regard to the value in trade between Ireland and Chile, in 2002 Chile was Ireland's 48th largest trading partner. Total trade was worth €73.78 million, up slightly from €72.02 million in 2001. Irish exports to Chile were valued at €36.6 million in 2002, a decrease of 3% on 2001. Imports from Chile in 2002 were valued at €37.1 million, an increase of 8% on 2001. I am arranging for the Deputy to receive a detailed breakdown of recent Ireland-Chile trade figures for his information.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The political situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate and remains a cause of serious concern for Ireland and her EU partners. The decline in respect for human rights and the rule of law persists. Arbitrary arrests, political violence and intimidation continue, with scores of Zimbabweans arrested in October for protesting against worsening economic conditions. Inflation now stands at 455% and the World Food Programme, WFP, estimates that over 7.2 million Zimbabweans, over half the population, will require food aid this year.On the issue of freedom of the press, the closure of the Daily News, Zimbabwe's independent newspaper, was condemned by the EU in September 2003. Following a successful appeal in the courts, the Daily News reopened and was immediately closed again by the Government. This is a matter of grave concern for the right of Zimbabweans to freedom of expression and association.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	304	On 23 February 2002, a formal cease-fire agreement was signed, with Norwegian facilitation, between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelan – LTTE – and the Sri Lankan Government. There have been six rounds of peace talks between the parties, brokered by the Norwegian Government. However, on 21 April 2003, the LTTE suspended its participation in the peace process, and demanded that an interim administration be established to govern the conflict zone. The LTTE claimed that it was not receiving sufficient dividends from the peace process.On 31 October 2003, following rounds of internal talks in France and Ireland, the LTTE submitted proposals to the Sri Lankan Government on an interim administration for the north and east of the country. The proposed interim administration would almost certainly require constitutional change, and that in turn would need the support of the opposition parties as well as the Government.On 4 November 2003, President Kumaratunga sacked three senior government ministers and assumed their powers, reportedly over their handling of the peace process with the LTTE. President Kumaratunga is apparently concerned about the LTTE proposals, and claims that the government, led by Prime Minister Wickramasinghe, is making too many concessions. She has also announced that talks with the LTTE have been postponed indefinitely. A state of emergency was declared and Parliament was prorogued for two weeks. Although President Kumaratunga holds the Presidency, her party is the official opposition, having lost parliamentary elections to Prime Minister Wickramasinghe two years ago.On 4 November, the Presidency of the European Union, in conjunction with the European Commission, issued a statement urging the parties involved to continue to work together in support of a negotiated political solution.Although President Kumaratunga has now lifted the state of emergency and suspension of Parliament, and called on all parties to join her in forming a government of national reconstruction and reconciliation, there are concerns that a prolonged confrontation between the Prime Minister and the President will result in a protracted power struggle which could ultimately jeopardise the peace process with the LTTE. However, to date the LTTE have declared that they will merely observe developments.Ireland supports the mediation efforts of the Sri Lanka monitoring mission, made up of a number of Nordic countries, and the efforts to resume peace talks by Norwegian peace envoy, Mr. Erik Solheim, as well as the negotiating efforts by representatives of both sides in the peace process. The Government, together with our EU partners, continues to monitor the situation closely.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	305	The Government unreservedly condemns the use of children as combatants in any conflict, including that which has occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – DRC. Such use is, of course, a breach of international law. Ireland has constantly urged all states to uphold their obligations under international human rights instruments to which they are party, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 38 of which calls on all states to refrain from recruiting children below the age of 15 into their armed forces.Ireland, along with its EU partners, has also sponsored successive resolutions on the human rights situation in the DRC at the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva which have condemned the recruitment and use of child soldiers by armed forces and groups operating on the territory of the DRC and called on those responsible to halt such illegal actions.The process of demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration within the DRC will be crucial for ensuring that adequate assistance and care is made available to all those, estimated to total possibly as many as 25,000, who were forcibly recruited as child soldiers during the conflict in that country. The European Union is committed to providing support for this process and those, such as the UN peacekeeping operation, MONUC, and the World Bank, principally charged with undertaking it.Consolidating the recent gains of the peace process in the DRC, and ensuring that the conditions which allowed for children to be forcibly recruited as soldiers do not reoccur will continue to be a major priority for Ireland and a focus of attention during our forthcoming EU Presidency. Ireland will also continue to support initiatives aimed at ending the culture of impunity generally in the Great Lakes region and bringing to account all those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of genocide.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Currently, all exports of arms from EU countries must conform with the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control such exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods including respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.Discussions are ongoing in the Union on the possible reinforcement of the status of the code of conduct by its transformation into an EU common position, which would be legally binding. Ireland is supportive of such a reinforcement of the code. This debate has intensified further following the adoption on 23 June 2003 by the Council of a common position on arms brokering. I am aware of the initiative for a framework convention, proposing a legally binding agreement with core principles and mechanisms relating to international transfers of arms, which is being promoted by a group of non-governmental organisations, NGOs. I understand that a conference will be held later this month in Cambridge to consider a draft convention and that a further meeting is envisaged early next year. The question of the adoption of an international arms trade treaty will also be discussed soon, at working group level, within the EU. The text of a draft convention has been received recently by my Department and is currently under consideration.In accordance with the EU code of conduct, Ireland's policy with regard to the arms trade is to work to prevent the export of equipment which might be used for internal repression or international aggression or contribute to regional instability. We will continue to follow closely all developments in this area.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The Irish Government was represented at the inauguration of the Liberian Transitional Government in Monrovia on October 14 by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt. Under the terms of the comprehensive peace agreement, CPA, that was brokered commendably by the regional organisation Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, on 18 August 2003 and which has been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, Mr Gyude Bryant will serve as chairman of the transitional government until parliamentary and presidential elections are held before the end of 2005. On taking office, Mr Bryant pledged to introduce transparency in government and respect for human rights. The process of selecting members of the transitional government and legislative assembly is ongoing.Despite recent improvements in the security situation in UN-controlled areas and progress in the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, the peace process remains fragile. Monrovia is now a weapons-free zone but the situation is less stable in other areas. Sporadic outbreaks of fighting in rebel strongholds highlight the need for a comprehensive process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration.The United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, was established on 19 September 2003 under UN Security Council Resolution 1509, for a period of one year. Under the resolution, UNMIL is mandated, among other things, to observe and monitor the comprehensive ceasefire agreement; to protect, within its capabilities, civilians under imminent threat of violence; to support the provision of humanitarian assistance; to help promote human rights; and to support generally the implementation of the peace process.The Government is of the view that the deployment of UNMIL is critically important in supporting the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement and for the political and economic recovery of Liberia. In this regard, the Minister for Defence yesterday sought and obtained Dáil approval for the participation in this mission of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force. The Irish contingent will comprise a motorised infantry battalion, of some 430 personnel, including the deployment of a small number of personnel at force headquarters in Monrovia.

At the current session of the sixth committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which considers questions of international law, Costa Rica presented a draft resolution which, had it been adopted, would have established an ad hoc committee with a mandate to begin negotiations on an international convention to prohibit all forms of human cloning.Ireland supported the Costa Rican resolution and was one of its co-sponsors. However, before action could be taken by the sixth committee on the Costa Rican resolution, a motion to defer consideration of the issue for two years was proposed by Iran, on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. Ireland voted against this motion. However, the motion was passed, by a narrow margin.

The purpose of State and official visits abroad is to promote Ireland's image in a positive way internationally and to develop further political, economic and cultural links with the countries concerned. The State visit of President McAleese was enormously successful and has intensified greatly our engagement with China in the political, economic and cultural fields.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Substantial progress continues to be made in the efforts to bring about a just and lasting peace in the DRC. The new transitional Government comprising representatives of the Government of President Kabila and of the main rebel groups held its initial meeting last July and continues to discharge its functions while, in August, the interim Parliament was officially inaugurated. A particularly important development which I welcome was the meeting on 25 September between the DRC, Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda in the presence of UN Secretary General Annan in which the countries agreed to refrain from interference in each other's affairs and to prevent arms shipments to warring groups in the eastern area of the DRC.However, the situation in the Ituri region and the north and south Kivus continues to be a source of concern. Recent incidents demonstrate the need for the newly formed transitional Government to establish its presence throughout the country and, in particular, in the eastern and north-eastern regions of the DRC. To this end, I welcome the decision by the transitional Government to send 3,000 police officers to the Ituri region. I also welcome the release of European Development Funds totalling €205 million to support the transitional Government in institution-building, constitutional reform and the strengthening of the rule of law, as well as funding for health services and debt relief.Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to encourage the transitional Government in Kinshasa to consolidate its authority throughout the territory of the DRC and to hasten the process of creating an integrated national army and police force. Specifically, as regards the envisaged integrated police force, the EU is currently exploring how it might best assist this process.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The Government aims to run an efficient, effective and impartial Presidency. The first half of 2004 presents very particular challenges, and our preparations, including on our Presidency programme, will reflect this. Ireland will be the first Presidency to preside over the enlarged Union of 25 states when the new member states formally accede to the Union on 1 May 2004. The successful integration of the new members will be an important focus for our Presidency. We will also take forward work on the further enlargement of the Union.The Union's agenda for economic, social and environmental renewal will be the focus for the spring European Council. We will be seeking to revitalise the process and give it greater dynamism as it approaches its crucial mid-term point.Justice and Home Affairs issues will feature prominently as work to complete the area of freedom, security and justice continues, in line with the Amsterdam Treaty and Tampere conclusions.The EU's external agenda is extensive and challenging. Transatlantic relations will be a key priority for our Presidency, as will support for effective multilateralism through close EU-UN co-operation, conflict prevention and ESDP and the EU's relationship with Africa. Other issues that will be prominent on the Council's external agenda include the Middle East peace process, relations with Russia, wider Europe and the western Balkans as well as the issues of human rights and disarmament and non-proliferation.Development issues will also be highlighted during our Presidency. In line with the Government's key priority for Ireland's development co-operation programme we will work to ensure maximum effectiveness of the EU's contribution to reducing global poverty and inequality. The fight against HIV-AIDS in developing countries will receive particular attention.I was delighted to provide detailed briefing on Ireland's Presidency priorities to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs on 9 September and the Government will continue to keep the Oireachtas fully informed as our Presidency programme develops.

While the terms of this resolution appear to satisfy the requirements of the Defence Acts in respect of deployment of members of the Permanent Defence Force, the question of such a deployment is not under consideration by the Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The internal security situation in Algeria remains extremely volatile. Presidential elections are scheduled to take place in April 2004, and political tensions are already increasing in the run-up to these elections. We and our EU partners are continuing our dialogue with Algeria and encouraging the Algerian Government to take further measures for the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights. We will continue to impress upon this Government the importance of implementing these necessary reforms.The Government believes that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Algeria will be enhanced by the EU-Algeria Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In particular, Article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice.At international fora such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, we and our EU partners have urged the Algerian Government to take concrete measures to improve the human rights situation in the country. We also urged it to respond positively to the requests for visits by the UN special rapporteur on torture and the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions.We attach particular importance to human rights issues in our bilateral relations with Algeria. We have urged the Algerian authorities to establish independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and to bring those responsible to justice.

The Deputy will recall that I called for an end to construction in my statement of 9 September. On 21 October Ireland's delegation to the UN co-sponsored a resolution in the General Assembly which demanded that Israel stop and reverse the construction of the wall. The European Union has made similar calls on several occasions, including at the European Council on 17 October last. The question of the wall has also been raised in discussions with US officials and during contacts with other concerned states.

I am concerned that the dispute should be managed in a manner that fully respects the human and civil rights of the tenant farmers in question.The EU Presidency plays an important role in fostering a constructive relationship with Pakistan in which positive developments with regard to human rights can be encouraged. As a member of the troika, Ireland participated in the recent EU ministerial mission to Islamabad, on 21 October 2003. The meeting focused on EU-Pakistan relations, the security situation in Afghanistan, terrorism, and relations with India. The discussion of democratisation and human rights in Pakistan was a core element of the mission.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The deaths which occurred during the riots of October 1988 still are a matter of deep concern to the international community. Estimates of the loss of life range between 159 and approximately 500 across the entire country. While the circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear in many cases, it is widely accepted that most of them were due to the actions of the security forces. The situation deteriorated substantially with civil conflict and, ultimately, the widespread massacres of 1997 and 1998. The civil conflict is estimated to have cost the lives of at least 100,000 people between 1992 and the present day, and in the massacres of 1997-98, whole villages were wiped out with the loss of thousands of lives. In many cases the responsibility for the massacres remains disputed.Throughout the civil conflict and subsequently, the Government has taken every appropriate step to express its concern to the Algerian authorities about the situation. The Government also strongly supported international efforts to have the massacres of 1997 and 1998 investigated by UN special rapporteurs. Regrettably, the then Government of Algeria refused to co-operate with these efforts despite the pressure placed upon that government by the international community. The Government continues to take the view that the Algerian Government should co-operate fully with all efforts by international humanitarian agencies to investigate these massacres or any other allegations of human rights abuse.

The 2000 final document represents a positive step on the road to nuclear disarmament. Of particular significance is the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapons states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals and the agreement on practical steps, to be taken by them, that would lead to nuclear disarmament.Since that time, Ireland and our partners in the new agenda coalition have advocated the implementation of these steps by all parties to the NPT, particularly the five nuclear weapons states. In the new agenda coalition ministerial declaration in September this year, my colleagues and I expressed our deep concern at the lack of progress to date in the implementation of the 13 steps agreed to in 2000.

Its acquisition by the State was an important indication of the Government's commitment, under the Good Friday Agreement, to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland.Since I responded to the House on 22 November 2001 on this matter, there have been a number of developments in regard to improving access to the battle site. In addition, the interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, has continued to advance plans for the long-term development of the project.The battle site is now open to the public throughout the summer, from May through to September. Guided tours of the site are available on a daily basis and a living history programme takes place every Sunday during that period. Replicas of military ordnance from the period, such as canons and muskets, are also on display. During the past year the Office of Public Works has carried out extensive work on Oldbridge House and Meath County Council has begun major road works to improve access to the site. It is now possible to have an enjoyable visitor experience at this historic site and the quality of that experience will continue to be improved and expanded as time goes on and as resources allow.On the long-term development of the site, the interdepartmental committee has concluded its work and has finalised its recommendations. I intend to take these recommendations to Government at an appropriate time. The committee is comprised of representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Taoiseach, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; as well as the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the Grand Lodge of the Orange Order.

The programme of ministerial travel for the Irish EU Presidency is currently being developed and, while not yet finalised, I expect to have heavy travel commitments during the next six months.As host of the EU Presidency, Ireland will represent the European Union in a range of regular meetings between the European Union and Third World countries. I will host a number of meetings of Foreign Ministers in Ireland, Brussels and in Third World country capitals during the course of our EU Presidency. While planning of dates and venues is still under way, I envisage, at this stage, holding political dialogue with the foreign ministers of the US, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Croatia, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States.During the Irish EU Presidency, we will also have meetings at foreign ministerial level of the ASEM process, which provides an opportunity for the EU to meet with a number of its Asian partners, and a Euro-Mediterranean mid-term ministerial. Both these meetings are likely to take place in Ireland.Early in our term of the EU Presidency, I intend to travel to the European Parliament and to present Ireland's Presidency programme to the Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I will also use this opportunity to meet and brief the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I also plan to attend the high level segment of the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March, where I will address the commission on behalf of the European Union.I will visit South Africa and Mozambique from 21 to 25 November for bilateral meetings with Government representatives and also to see programmes supported by Development Co-operation Ireland in both countries.A table outlining my other foreign travel plans until 13 May 2004 follows:Travel Plans until 13 May 2004
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I am aware of the Amnesty International report, Rough Justice, to which the Deputy refers. I share his concerns about the information it contains regarding violations of human rights in Russia. It is clear from the report that Russia has faced difficulties in building new institutions for the protection of human rights following the end of the Soviet Union. The statistics presented in the Amnesty International report with regard to fatalities from domestic violence in the Russian Federation are particularly alarming, and the situation of prisoners is very worrying. We are aware of the campaign by Amnesty International to highlight these serious problems, which have struck a chord with many people in Ireland.The attitude of police forces is of crucial importance in addressing these problems. The Deputy may be aware that in 2002 Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, contributed €230,101 towards a Council of Europe police training programme in Russia, entitled Police and Human Rights beyond 2000, one component of which addresses the issue of domestic violence. The programme provides training to the participants from the Russian police forces in areas such as recognition of the signs of domestic violence, and steps to be taken in handling these situations. The programme includes discussion of methods to prevent domestic abuse, and advice is given to participants on how to conduct effective investigations in cases of domestic violence. Development Co-operation Ireland has also given funding on a number of occasions to projects involving state institutions for the care of children in Russia. In this way, the Government is making a concrete contribution to addressing some the problems raised by Amnesty International.There is agreement within the European Union that the development of EU relations with Russia should be based on respect for human rights as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. EU funding is available for projects to promote the rule of law and to improve the human rights situation in Russia.It is also possible to report some positive developments. Russia's membership of the Council of Europe, for example, creates opportunities for constructive dialogue with the Russian Federation, including on human rights and democratisation issues. It also gives Russian citizens recourse to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, the decisions of which are legally binding. This is a welcome development.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I condemn the recent violent attacks in Iraq. Attacks on civilians cannot be justified under any circumstances, while attacks against international relief agencies and targets with high risk of civilian casualties are also particularly abhorrent.The significance of the attacks on the UN and Red Cross cannot be underestimated. The Red Cross has stressed that it will not leave Iraq but is reducing its foreign staff based there. The United Nations has ordered the temporary withdrawal of its remaining international staff from Baghdad as part of a review of the security situation there. Several other aid agencies have announced they will be scaling down or reassessing their operations in Iraq, in light of the deteriorating security situation.The withdrawal or scaling down of operations by aid agencies is understandable in these circumstances but very regrettable. It will without doubt have a negative impact on the ordinary people of Iraq.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The recent failure to reach agreement on a framework for the continuation of negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda at the Cancún WTO Ministerial is very regrettable. The major losers from the failure to agree at Cancún are developing and least developed countries as the DDA is designed to effectively address their needs and to assist them integrate into the world economy.A period of internal reflection and consultation has now commenced among EU member states and within and between the EU Commission and EU Council to assess the implications of the failure at Cancún and the setback for the DDA. This is appropriate before reaching any conclusions about the position of the European Community regarding the trade negotiations or the next steps to be taken. This also allows for critical consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the WTO as an organisation and what needs to be done to enable it to achieve its objectives. Ireland is participating fully in this reflections process.The outcome of these reflections will have an important part to play in shaping and deciding on the priorities ahead. The outputs from this period of reflection will feed into, for example, the discussion and consideration of trade issues at the forthcoming informal EU Trade Ministers meeting in early December, to be followed by the scheduled meeting of the WTO General Council, in Geneva, on 15 December.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	325	FÁS as an agency under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is responsible for promoting employment of people with disabilities in the private sector. In this context, FÁS offers a wide range of services to people who are seeking employment, including advice, job placement and training. To assist in the integration of people with disabilities into the open labour market, FÁS also provides a range of supports to people with disabilities and to employers including grants for job interview interpreters; workplace-equipment adaptation; disability awareness training support; employee retention; employment support; and the supported employment programme.Responsibility for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is a matter for the Department of Finance. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for chairing a committee that monitors achievement of the 3% target for people with disabilities in the public service.It should be noted that public sector bodies are subject to the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998, and as such are required to do all that is reasonable to ensure that their employees with disabilities can perform capably in their jobs.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Labour Inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to all workers in the State in exactly the same manner. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) are concerned with the establishment of minimum rates of pay and conditions for workers in specific sectors of the economy and in this connection I can confirm that such an order is in place with respect to workers in the agricultural industry.Regarding workers in industries where there is not an ERO such employees entitlements, in so far as wages are concerned, are in accordance with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.In addition to the investigative work undertaken by my Inspectorate in 2003, work that commenced in 2002 was completed on the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures in the Labour Inspectorate. The new IT system went live at the end of June this year. The project represents a considerable investment by my Department, approximately €900,000, in the enforcement of employment rights for all workers. The system provides the technological support to enable Inspectors operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike. In particular, by facilitating remote connection to head office, the requirement for regular visits to the office to complete administrative deskwork has been significantly curtailed.Information on employment rights is provided by my Department by a variety of means and is available in eight of the main foreign languages. This element is in the process of being upgraded. In addition, where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, others than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement.Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wages legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid; P60 and other sources are used. New work permits are not granted for sectors where it is believed that such employment can be met from the Irish-EEA labour market. Accordingly, I am satisfied that there are sufficient procedures in place and an appropriate level of inspection activity to ensure, as far as possible, that rights and entitlements under Irish law are being observed for all workers. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting emigrant workers I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the Labour Inspectorate for investigation and further action.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Price control was a feature of policy in the 1980s when inflation rates reached over 20%. It is a policy mechanism which was shown to have failed, with the maximum prices for products controlled tending to become the minimum. I have no plans to reintroduce price controls on any products.I believe that increased competition is the best way of reducing prices and ensuring that consumers get value for money. However, in order for competition to be effective, consumers must also be given sufficient information to enable them to compare prices. Accordingly, the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1991 requires that the price of both alcoholic and soft drinks be displayed immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to a licensed premises. The purpose of the order is to ensure that consumers are aware of the prices charged before they enter a licensed premises. The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.In addition, as part of the Government's anti-inflationary initiative, an information campaign was launched on 2 November. This campaign, which is being run by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, is being carried out on behalf of the group set up under the Partnership Agreement 2003-2005 – Sustaining Progress. It recognises that markets work better with fuller information and that unfortunately price awareness decreased over recent years during the times of the Celtic tiger.The purpose of the campaign is to make consumers think about prices, promote price comparison and encourage them to have a greater regard about pricing when choosing goods or services. The campaign will run for four weeks in the media and over the national and local radio stations and on TV. The theme is "price awareness pays". Consumers are being encouraged to look and see the prices they pay for everyday goods and services and if they are not happy to question them.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Under the Competition Act 2002 responsibility for regulating mergers and acquisitions was transferred from my Department to the Competition Authority with effect from 1 January 2003. I retained a role in the decision making process but only where the merger or acquisition concerns a media business. Accordingly, I have no regulatory function in relation to the sale of the company referred to by the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	329	When I met with a delegation from Donegal County Development Board last month, the discussion was primarily in relation to progressing a number of key economic infrastructure projects in the county. The projects relate to broadband, air access, roads, water and energy, i.e. electricity and gas. An application for INTERREG funding to construct an open access broadband telecommunications link between Derry and Letterkenny is being pursued. The key item under air access is the development of the runway at Derry airport. Under roads, the main concerns being pursued are the Lifford-Letterkenny national primary road, improvements to the A5 road in Northern Ireland connecting Lifford with Monaghan, and also the link between the N56 and the N14. As regards water, funding for the Letterkenny water supply scheme is being provided under the water services investment programme of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. On energy, a feasibility study grant for the extension of the natural gas pipeline from Derry to Letterkenny was approved under INTERREG last month; the ESB is committed to upgrading the electricity infrastructure in the county.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The choice of locations of webworks is primarily a matter for Enterprise Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. The webworks programme arose from a major study of the Internationally Traded Services – ITS – sector by Enterprise Ireland. The study, ITS 2007, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, examined areas with potential for development in Ireland and made recommendations for policy formation and specific interventions by the development agencies.The study recognised that the new knowledge-intensive industries were largely establishing in the Dublin area and recommended the creation of regional hubs to address this imbalance. The webworks programme aims to create the environment that will foster the clustering of new ITS companies in the regions. The study recommended that large-scale webworks, c. 50,000 square feet, be located in the major regional urban centres of Galway, Cork and Limerick immediately and that one smaller webwork, c. 20,000 square feet, be considered for a primary regional town on a pilot basis. The study also recommended that consideration should be given to extending the webworks programme to other regional towns with institutes of technology such as Letterkenny if the pilot centres prove to be successful.In line with ITS 2007, Enterprise Ireland decided that large webworks be established in the major regional centres of Galway, Cork and Limerick. It was also decided that two smaller centres be provided in regions not covered by the major urban centres where there was a low level of ITS companies. The north-west and the south-east are two such regions and it was decided that the pilot centres should be located in the main regional towns of Sligo and Waterford to test the viability of centres in regional towns. Enterprise Ireland expects that the construction of all these centres will commence by the end of 2004.

In this regard IDA Ireland has developed a number of cross-border links, to strengthen the partnerships and the promotion of the north-west region as a whole for new inward investment activity.The most significant initiative is a proposed new virtual cross-Border business park to position the north-west region as a key technology magnet on the island of Ireland. This concept, which is being jointly developed between IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland, envisages the provision of the highest levels of infrastructure in telecommunications and property solutions linking Derry city and Letterkenny.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The reduction in the early retirement pension being paid to the person named is because she has reached the age of 66. It is a condition of the EU regulation governing the scheme that the early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension paid to the retired farmer. The person named has a non-contributory widow's pension. When she reached the age of 66 on 29 September 2003, she had the choice under the social welfare system of keeping the widow's pension or transferring to the non-contributory old age pension. She opted to continue with the widow's pension.For the purposes of the early retirement scheme, the widow's pension is not regarded as a national retirement pension while the recipient is under the age of 66. Once the person named reached that age, however, my Department was obliged to treat her widow's pension as a national retirement pension and offset it against her early retirement pension. The same would have happened if she had opted for the non-contributory old age pension.

In processing the application for payment, it was found that one animal, tag number KLMN0012P, was moved out of the holding inside the six months retention period and therefore required replacing. Correspondence issued to the herdowner on 8 November 2003 requesting her to nominate a suitable replacement. As soon as this information is available the application will be processed further.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 to 125, inclusive, together.Badgers are removed following the issue of a licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. A condition of the licence is that the restraints are checked at least once every 24 hours. In my Department's wildlife programme the protocols for removing badgers include this condition and specifically oblige all restraints to be checked before noon each day. This minimises the time spent by the badger in the restraint. In some very exceptional cases, where a large number of badgers are found in the same area, this may result in some checks being made later, but this is rare.

An IAS 1 form was received by my Department from the above-named person on 16 September 2003. It appears that this application may not have been submitted within the period of six months referred to above and that a penalty may, therefore, be applicable.However, a final decision as to payment must await receipt of the application for payment (IAS 2) from the person concerned. Once this has been received, the outcome will be notified to the applicant in due course.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	345	It is difficult to give a precise answer to this question as it is not clear if the individual in question has had Irish source income or has owned Irish assets during his or her 20 years abroad. However, some general points can be made as follows. An individual who is resident, ordinarily resident and Irish domiciled is taxable in full on all Irish and foreign sourced income. An individual who is resident and ordinarily resident but not Irish domiciled is taxable on Irish sourced income in full and taxable on remittances of foreign sourced income. An individual who is resident and domiciled but not ordinarily resident is taxable on Irish sourced income in full and taxable on remittances of foreign sourced income. A liability to Irish capital gains tax on gains from the disposals of world-wide assets will arise when an Irish domiciled individual becomes Irish resident or ordinarily resident. An individual who is resident or ordinarily resident but not Irish domiciled is liable to Irish capital gains tax on any gains arising from the disposal of Irish and UK assets and taxable on remittances of gains arising from the disposal of other foreign assets.As regards the term ‘ordinarily resident', the individual will become Irish ordinarily resident for tax purposes if he-she remains Irish resident for the three consecutive years after his-her return. As regards the term 'domicile', this is a concept of general law. It may be broadly interpreted as meaning residence in a particular country with the intention of residing permanently in that country. Every individual acquires a domicile of origin at birth. For example, an Irish born individual who returns to live in Ireland, having lived abroad for a number of years, will be regarded as having revived his/her Irish domicile of origin.If the Deputy wishes to obtain further information on the matter with regards to a specific case, it is suggested that he either write to me with the details or raise the matter directly with the Revenue Commissioners.

Many of these stations are dispersed throughout the country and consist mostly of one-man units.The overall cost of refurbishment would be very substantial and cannot be funded from existing resources. The Commissioners of Public Works consider that the best method of addressing this problem is to engage in an equity exchange programme with the private sector. This programme will involve the disposal to private developers of certain Garda stations which are in need of significant refurbishment in exchange for alternative good quality premises which meet modern standards. These alternative premises may be either newly built or may be existing buildings that satisfy Office of Public Works specifications and Garda requirements. This programme is additional to the ongoing Garda maintenance programme. It is a fundamental requirement of the programme that no existing station will be closed-disposed of until a suitable replacement is ready for occupation.Subject to the agreement of the Garda authorities, it is intended to run a pilot programme covering a small cluster of stations in the Tipperary-Limerick area.

Ireland supports a proposal by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, made in Recommendation No. 1583, that an independent commission of inquiry, which would include international investigators, should be established so that there can be a full examination of the case.Political dialogue meetings with Ukraine, including dialogue at Foreign Minister level, will be held during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. As part of that dialogue and in co-ordination with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to raise the case to which the Deputy refers.

These include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography and trafficking in persons. The Government is also opposed to all acts and practices which degrade or exploit human beings.Through its participation at international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Ireland raises its concerns in tandem with like-minded countries regarding these issues.The importance of addressing trafficking in persons has been recognised by Ireland and our EU partners. Article 5 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that no one should be held in slavery or be required to perform forced or compulsory labour. It also prohibits trafficking in human beings. A number of legislative proposals have been initiated at EU level to combat trafficking. The Council directive defines the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence and the Council framework strengthens the penal framework to prevent facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence. The Council established the Stop II Programme which, from 2001 to 2002, financed programmes to combat and prevent trafficking and also to assist the victims of trafficking. In 2002, the Council adopted a programme called AGIS which replaces Stop II and 5 other programmes and will run from 2003 to 2007.In addition Ireland, along with all other EU member states and the EU Commission, has signed the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and its two accompanying protocols on prevention, suppression and punishment of trafficking in persons, especially women and children and smuggling of migrants by land, air or sea. The protocol on trafficking not only provides for measures to suppress trafficking, but also measures to protect the victims of trafficking.Ireland in co-operation with its EU partners has also been active in other regional fora. In this regard, the mechanism for implementing the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's, OSCE, action plan to combat trafficking is currently under consideration. In the Council of Europe, work began in September on a Convention on Trafficking in Human Beings aimed at setting up a joint observatory on trafficking.

Effective conduct of ongoing ESDP operations will be a central priority, as will planning for any future missions which may arise.The theme of conflict prevention will be an important cross-cutting aim of our Presidency. In conjunction with our partners, we will seek to implement further the EU's programme for the prevention of violent conflicts. As part of our commitment to this area, we will be hosting a conference on conflict prevention in Dublin in late March-early April which will focus on the role of civil society and non-governmental organisations in conflict prevention.On international terrorism, Ireland will pursue the further implementation of the EU's comprehensive plan of action to combat terrorism, adopted following the events of 11 September 2001 and the implementation of the provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions 1373 and 1390 with particular emphasis on the suppression of the financing of terrorism. Ireland will maintain and orient the European Union's policy regarding, and response to, international terrorism, taking account of the human rights dimension attaching to counter-terrorism, and the long-term need to explore further the underlying causes of terrorism and the consequences of terrorist attacks.The European Commission's proposal for the funding of embryo stem cell research in limited circumstances is to be the subject of a debate in the European Parliament next week and of discussion at the forthcoming meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 27 November at which Ireland will be represented by the Tánaiste. Until it becomes clear in what way the matter will be progressed in the coming period it is not possible to say whether the issue will fall for further consideration during the Irish Presidency. The Government's broad approach to funding for embryonic stem cell research has, primarily, been to ensure that funding would not be available for research in Ireland which is not compatible with our law and ethical guidelines. Ireland supported the current moratorium at EU level on funding for such research and is anxious to see the greatest possible safeguards applying even in those member states where such research is legal and considered ethical.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The Government continues to look to the United Nations Security Council to ensure that the United Nations is seen to maintain its proper role as acting on behalf of the entire international community. The Government has consistently advocated a central role for the UN in the reconstruction of Iraq.The UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1511 on Iraq on 16 October. It outlines the UN role in Iraq, in particular through the reporting requirements which give the Security Council a structured and formal role in the process. The resolution qualifies its requests to the UN with the phrase "as circumstances permit". This reflects concerns about security that had been expressed by Secretary-General Annan. The resolution authorises a multinational force to "take all measures necessary to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq", including "to contribute to the security of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq". It does not specify any particular peacekeeping role for the UN, although it does provide that the Security Council shall review the mission of the multinational force within a year.The UN has been given a strengthened role in the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq. We hope that the role of the UN in Iraq outlined in the resolution will prove sufficient for it to carry out its work effectively.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The reduction of hunger and poverty in the world is, I believe, one of the most important tasks to which the international community can dedicate itself in the 21st century. It is a task which can only be achieved when donors such as Ireland, the EU and others work hand in hand with United Nations agencies dedicated to relieving poverty throughout the world. At the Millennium Summit in September 2000, the leaders of the world set themselves the ambitious target of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, by 2015. These MDGs aim to halve international poverty indicators by 2015.A key goal in this period is to halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Regional trends show that, while some progress is being made on this objective in East Asia and the Pacific, rates of malnutrition remain high in South Asia, and they are rising in sub-Saharan Africa.Ireland will play its role at every level in order to support actions designed to bring about the achievement of the MDGs. At the bilateral level, we will continue to work towards meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for development assistance. We will also strive to ensure the highest possible quality of our aid programme in meeting the needs of the poorest of the poor.At the practical level, the Government is engaged in a number of humanitarian initiatives. Next week, on 19 November, Ireland will host the launch of the 2004 UN Humanitarian Appeal. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, will represent the UN at the event. The consolidated appeals process, CAP, guided by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, is a key instrument for the humanitarian community and acts as the principal vehicle for strategic planning and resource mobilisation. It facilitates effective and efficient responses to famines and other emergencies by fostering collaboration among key humanitarian agencies including non-governmental organisations, donors, and host governments. In hosting the launch, Ireland will highlight chronic humanitarian emergencies which have faded from public consciousness or indeed have never been highlighted sufficiently.At the EU level, Ireland will host an informal meeting of the Humanitarian Affairs Committee in Dublin next March. This meeting will bring together senior representatives from the humanitarian authorities in member states and the Commission to share information in relation to the management and implementation of humanitarian aid. At the meeting in Dublin, Ireland will focus the discussion on the effective delivery of food and other humanitarian aid in conflict situations.

Negotiations are continuing with Bulgaria and Romania. The EU will decide on the next steps with regard to Turkey's candidature in the second half of 2004. Croatia has applied to join the EU and I expect the Commission's opinion on their application to be available in the spring of 2004. Other countries in the Western Balkans region have membership of the Union as their objective.I fully support this process as the best possible guarantee of peace, stability and democracy for the future.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Government is fully committed to the Union's Common and Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, including the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, and, together with our EU partners, plays a full and active role in the formation and implementation of the Union's external relations. The primary forum in which this engagement occurs is the monthly meeting of Foreign Ministers in the General Affairs and External Relations Council at which foreign policy issues are discussed. The Government is also involved on a daily basis in the development and implementation of the Union's foreign policy through participation in EU working groups, senior official meetings and through bilateral contacts with our EU partners and other countries.As holder of the Presidency in the first half of next year, Ireland will be responsible for driving forward the Union's work in the area of CFSP, and for ensuring the external representation of the Union. This will mean that Ireland will play a central role in developing the Union's policy on issues such as the Middle East Peace Process, Iraq, the Western Balkans, Africa, international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In our capacity as President, we will also work to further the objectives of the CFSP which include the promotion of international co-operation, the preservation of international peace and security, the development of and consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. These objectives are also the core principles of Ireland's foreign policy.In the security and defence area, Ireland will seek to facilitate continued development of the EU's capacity to prevent and manage crises. Effective conduct of ongoing ESDP operations will be a central priority, as will planning for any future missions which may arise. Ireland will also seek to develop and strengthen relations between the EU and our international partners, including the United Nations, NATO and third countries, in the area of crisis management.

Together with our EU partners, the Government monitors the human rights situations in many countries, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including non-governmental organisations. Where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question, either directly or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights. At these bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situation in various countries. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an occasion where Ireland can voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights.The EU has also adopted common positions on certain countries an integral part of which attaches priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries.The Government will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Since its recognition just 20 years ago, HIV-AIDS has spread to all countries across the globe and is likely to become the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in the 21st century. By far the worst-affected region, sub-Saharan Africa is now home to 29.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred there in 2002, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans in the past year.The response of the international community to HIV-AIDS is guided by the Declaration of Commitment on HIV-AIDS, which was agreed at a special session of the UN General Assembly, UNGASS, held in June 2001. In his address to the UNGASS, the Taoiseach announced the commitment of an additional $30 million, €31.5 million, to address the HIV-AIDS pandemic to be spent through the Government's official aid programme.This pledge has been fully honoured by the Government and was reaffirmed last month by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his address to the UN General Assembly debate on the UNGASS.Over the last three years, the volume of Government funds committed to HIV-AIDS has increased ten-fold. In 2002 alone, more than €40 million was spent on HIV-AIDS programmes. There has been a similar budget for 2003. These additional resources have been directed at HIV-AIDS activities at the global, regional, national and community levels and are implemented through international and regional organisations and in programme countries. There has been a particular focus on addressing the epidemic in the most highly affected countries in Africa.The Government's financial contributions to the fight against HIV-AIDS are complemented by a strong policy of influencing other OECD donors and international agencies for a more urgent and effective response to this disease.The Government provides funding to the joint United Nations programme on HIV-AIDS, UNAIDS, the main advocate for global action on the epidemic. It leads, strengthens and supports an expanded response aimed at preventing transmission of HIV, providing care and support, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV-AIDS, and alleviating the impact of the epidemic.

A panel of assessors examined the documentation and visited the college. The programme accreditation committee of HETAC considered their report and accredited the programme. A certificate of course approval was issued in July 2003.As the Minister for Education and Science is the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for purposes of employment for the regulated profession of primary teacher, Hibernia College contacted the Department as to whether their qualification would be recognised for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher.The decision of the Minister was that he would recognise the qualification of graduate diploma in primary education of Hibernia College for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher provided all of the conditions set by HETAC were met, including those relating to quality assurance.

Provision for the youth sector increased by almost 60% from 1997 to 2003 which demonstrates the Government's commitment to supporting the work of the youth sector.The question of additional funding for the youth sector will be dealt with in the 2004 Estimates process. I might point out that by its nature, the Youth Work Act 2001 has to be implemented on an incremental basis. The national youth work development plan is intended to cover a five-year period and was published earlier this year on the basis of its phased implementation as financial resources permit.

Following an assessment of the application it was agreed that appropriate accommodation would be provided for a three-classroom school.On foot of the report to which the Deputy refers, arrangements were put in train for the acquisition of a greenfield site to facilitate the provision of a new school building. However, in September 2002 the board of management was notified that due to the adverse financial situation a decision had been taken not to proceed with the acquisition of a site. Accordingly, the school was not included in the 2003 capital programme.In order to alleviate the school's temporary accommodation problems which have arisen as a result of the appointment of an additional teacher from September 2003, my Department sanctioned grant aid towards the purchase of a temporary classroom in May of this year.The school's permanent accommodation needs will be considered in the context of the 2004 capital programme.

My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has established a committee to oversee the development and implementation of the national awareness campaign on which my Department is represented. Throughout the development of the campaign, the committee has been in consultation with the Garda Síochána, Departments, the voluntary sector and the health boards.The task in developing the campaign was to inform and, in some cases, re-inform the general public as to the facts about drugs and the drugs question. In May of this year, the first stage of the campaign was launched with the publication of a general information brochure on drugs. The aim of the first stage was to create discussion not just in the public arena but in homes, schools and workplaces across Ireland. The brochure was distributed to general practitioners, libraries, youth information centres and health boards. Copies are also distributed through the operation of a national information telephone number. An advertising campaign accompanied the launch which included items on television and national and local radio. This phase also introduced a website which contains the same information as in the brochure.The second phase of the campaign was recently launched with the release of a leaflet which is a parent's guide to drugs and gives answers to many questions raised by parents concerning their children and drugs. This phase is in line with action 35 of the national drugs strategy which requires my Department to ensure that parents have access to factual preventative materials which encourage them to discuss the issues of coping with drugs and drugs misuse with their children. The leaflet is designed to be used in conjunction with the initial campaign brochure and has been distributed to health boards, the national information telephone line, community groups working with parents and various support programmes under the aegis of my Department. A three week radio advertising campaign accompanied the second phase.My Department has also ensured that the social, personal and health education programmes are being delivered in all primary and post-primary schools in the country since September 2003. The aim of these programmes is to ensure that every child has the necessary knowledge and life-skills to resist drugs or make informed choices about their health, personal lives and social development.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	372	In 1998 my Department, in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, took a proactive approach to identifying and eradicating radon in schools. This commenced with my Department commissioning the RPII to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools. This survey predated legislation on the issue of radon in the workplace by over two years and the action taken exceeds any legislative requirement in that all schools, regardless of whether or not they were situated in areas of high radon, were invited to be tested. In addition, in June 2001, Circular letter 46/01 issued to all boards of management informing them of my Department's initiative and advising schools on the course of action necessary for radon mitigation.During the course of the survey, 4072 schools were invited to participate, of which 3798 schools responded and were sent detectors. Radon surveys were subsequently completed in 3444 schools. Approximately 300 schools had radon concentrations above the workplace reference level of 400 Bq/m. These schools were advised to secure the services of suitably qualified personnel to carry out all remedial works specified by a consultant architect.Where radon levels in classrooms were found to be above 200 Bq/m³ and under 400 Bq/m³, my Department issued a grant of €191 per classroom advising schools to install suitable vents in these classrooms. Over 800 schools qualified for grant-aid under this category.Initially, following completion of remediation works, post-remediation measurements were carried out by the RPII within a three to nine month period after remediation had taken place. This process is ongoing and the RPII continue to carry out post-remediation testing in schools. Consultations are ongoing between my Department and the RPII on the issue of the long-term efficiency of radon mitigation systems, which have been installed in schools and also to ensure that radon levels remain below the accepted reference levels.Some 565 schools did not respond to the initial invitation to have radon measurements carried out. Following consultations with my Department's building unit, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has recently contacted the 565 schools that have not yet been tested for radon, including schools in Donegal, stressing the importance of assessing radon exposure of all staff and pupils, and has advised that my Department will meet the cost of the survey, and subsequent remedial work as required. I would also like to assure the Deputy that my Department's building unit ensures that radon barriers are included in the designs of all new school buildings.A list of schools in Donegal that were found to have radon levels above 200 bq/m³ and a list of the Donegal schools that have not yet been tested for radon, included in the 565 schools mentioned above, will be forwarded to the Deputy.

In the current school year, allocations in respect of music programmes under the co-operation heading amounted to 92.76 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. However, I understand that no application for such support has been received by my Department from County Donegal VEC.As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 108 of 23 October 2003, my Department pays the salaries of the teachers in the case of school-based tuition and there is normally no tuition cost to students in these circumstances. Where students take music lessons outside their school in a college or school of music, or privately, they can expect to pay a fee and my Department does not subsidise such fees. The Deputy may wish to note that students attending the courses run by County Cork, City of Dublin and the City of Limerick VEC pay a fee to the appropriate VEC.My Department at present is examining policy issues relating to music education provision within the VEC sector. The need for any further development and/or supports in this area will be considered having regard to the outcome of this examination.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The school in question had an enrolment of 180 pupils on 30 September 2002 which entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2003-04 school year. The agreed appointment figure for the eighth mainstream class teacher is 193 pupils. An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.

It has been assigned a “band three” rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Projects listed in sections 6 and 7 will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning at this time. Budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned. In the meantime, individual schools should, as appropriate, use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.

The most recent report entitled "College Entry in Focus: A Fourth National Survey of Access to Higher Education" is based on a national survey of all first enrolments of undergraduates in their first year of study as full-time higher education students in 43 colleges in autumn 1998. The study was based primarily on an analysis of personal demographic and educational data, which were abstracted from individual student record forms. Being the fourth in a series of national surveys carried out at six-yearly intervals, this study facilitates an analysis of changes in the pattern of participation over a period of 18 years.An important feature of this study is the comprehensive analysis of national and county participation rates. Chapters five and six of the report examine national and county participation rates and a number of correlates of differential participation rates in an attempt to explain differences in admission rates by county. Rates of admission varied significantly by county. The report found that counties Laois and Offaly were in the lower third of ranking with an admission rate of less than 40%.In an attempt to explain the differences the report looked at a multivariate of factors related to varying county admission rates. Three groups of variables were examined as possible predictors of county admission rates. The variables used involve measures of the distance from the nearest college, pattern of participation at second level and some socio-economic characteristics of the population of each county.

Candidates are expected to have knowledge of the teaching methods of Irish as a mother tongue and as a second language to primary school children, and of strategies to promote the use of Irish as a language of communication and as a teaching medium. While some students in the teacher training colleges take Irish to primary degree level, many take the professional Irish programme, Gaeilge ghairmiúil. The standard of Irish required by the SCG would be on a par with the professional Irish programme delivered by the teacher training colleges.The standard required to obtain a pass in the SCG is the standard of Irish that would enable teachers to teach the language to sixth class in a national school. Candidates must therefore demonstrate that they have attained the level of language competence described in the syllabus and reflected in the examination papers, and that they understand the methodology of teaching Irish as a second language. It must be borne in mind that many primary schools not only teach Irish but have Irish as the principal language of instruction and communication generally. The number of such schools has in fact grown significantly in recent years. A primary teacher may have to teach pupils whose mother tongue is Irish, or who are competent users of the language. Even when teaching Irish to pupils whose mother tongue is English or another language, it is widely accepted by language teachers that in order to be effective, the teacher needs to have a very good command of the language.I established a working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the scrúdú le haghaidh cailíochta sa Ghaeilge in 2001.

Under this agreement, which became effective on 1 September 2000, incremental credit may be awarded in respect of all recognised teaching service given by qualified teachers in an EU state. The earliest date from which incremental credit will be awarded under the new agreement is 1 September 1994 or the date of appointment of the teacher whichever is the later. Arising from this agreement, teachers who had previously been awarded incremental credits up to a maximum of seven years, are entitled to apply for incremental credit in respect of any such service in excess of the original seven years allowed, subject to the limitation referred to. A total of 23 such cases have arisen to date and the necessary awards have been made. Details of the specific countries in which such training and experience was gained are not readily available in my Department.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

Furthermore, the director general of the maritime safety directorate met representatives of the Belmullet sea angling club in Westport on 25 March 2003 on my behalf. It was explained at that meeting that my primary concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waters. The licensing of all passenger boats through their compliance with the new passenger boat regulations is the best way to ensure the safety of crew and passengers. As my position on safety and the passenger boat regulations has already been fully explained to both the IFSA and a delegation from Belmullet sea angling club I do not consider that another meeting is necessary to clarify the position any further.

The regulatory package is designed to bring European Community legislation on electronic communications into line with the far-reaching changes, including technological convergence, taking place in the telecommunications, media and information technologies sectors; strengthen competition in the electronic communications markets in the EU and simplify and clarify the current complex regulatory framework by reducing the number of specific legal measures therein; and provide a lighter regulatory touch in those cases where markets have become more competitive while attempting to ensure that a minimum of services is available to all users at an affordable price and that the basic rights of consumers continue to be protected.As a consequence of the definitions in the regulatory package, cable operators are no longer subject to regulation by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in the areas of price, transparency, publication of information and quality of services. Draft heads of an electronic communications miscellaneous provisions Bill are at an early stage of progression. The Bill will apply appropriate provisions of the regulatory framework to retail broadcasting service providers. These provisions will include measures contained in the universal service directive regarding quality of service, billing disputes, transparency, dominance etc. The Bill will provide for regulation across platforms, thereby levelling the playing field between service providers.

For the 2003 programme, at the initiative of my Department and in consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Area Development Management, ADM, the agency with responsibility for the administration of RAPID, it was decided that only those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, i.e. namely RAPID 1, RAPID 2, local drugs task force areas and Clár should be treated as disadvantaged areas.I intend to advertise the 2004 sports capital programme before the end of this year.

I am well aware of the problems that have arisen for those in the arts sector because of the unavoidable reduction in funding this year. However, I would point out that although the Arts Council's funding was reduced this year by around 7.5% on the 2002 figure, that 2002 figure was the culmination of steady year-on-year increases since 1997. Indeed, Arts Council funding increased by over 80% between 1997 and 2002.It is clear that there are now far more venues and facilities available across the country than was ever before the case, as a result of very substantial State aid for the provision of such facilities, most recently through my Department's ACCESS programme. However, it is more for the Arts Council than for the Minister of the day to comment on the levels and distribution of activity in specific areas of the arts.The Arts plan was and is an Arts Council strategy, not a Government strategy, and although Government has endorsed the principles on which the plan was based, this did not extend to acceptance of the annual financial targets on which it was based. The amount that Government can provide for the Arts Council is dependent on the Estimates process, which is of course based on an annual cycle.However, the Deputy will be aware that the Council will receive a 19% increase in 2004 on 2003 funding levels, which clearly demonstrates the extent of my own and the Government's commitment to the arts.

It also issues birth, death and marriage certificates from the central database and is currently being rolled out to civil registration offices. The system has already been introduced in a number of offices. Arrangements are being finalised with the remaining offices, including offices within the administrative remit of the North-Western Health Board. Electronic search and issue of certificates was introduced in the Sligo office as part of this process. These aspects of the system will soon be implemented in the remaining NWHB civil registration offices and will be followed shortly thereafter by electronic registration.Births that occur in Northern Ireland will fall to be registered in the relevant offices within that jurisdiction.The REACH agency development is an inter-agency messaging service and it is a key building block of the public service broker. It is a centralised messaging hub that facilitates co-operation and the exchange of information between public sector agencies using agreed date and communication standards. Since September the IAMS has facilitated the transfer of life event information between the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the purposes of allocating personal public service numbers to newborn children. They are then registered on the new electronic birth registration system that is currently being rolled out by the GRO. In October the IAMS also started to transmit life event data between the GRO and the Central Statistics Office.At present work is ongoing on a new service, the death event publication service. Its aim will be to provide information on registered deaths to pension paying Departments and other interested public service agencies.

On 15 May a campaign, entitled Drugs: There are Answers. To make the right choices, you need the right information, was launched following a detailed consultation process.The overall aim of the campaign is to increase awareness amongst the general population about the current drug problems facing our society through the achievement of measurable change in the knowledge and attitude of targeted groups. This overall aim will be achieved through the following objectives: development and dissemination of key messages relevant to identified targeted populations, including the general population; working in partnership with relevant stakeholders to develop messages and communicate with targeted groups in a manner that will augment ongoing education and prevention work; and participating in ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the campaign as part of an action-research project that will be initiated in parallel with this campaign.The campaign features television and radio advertisements supported by an information brochure, telephone helpline and a website. These are all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland.The first phase targeted the general population and ran over an eight week period. The current phase is specifically targeting parents through a combination of radio advertisements, distribution of a parents booklet on drugs and a significant programme of media relations.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question Nos. 443 and 444 on 7 October, which was as follows.The current regulations on the use of safety belts in vehicles have been in force since 1 January 1993. From 25 August safety belt-related offences by drivers of vehicles attract penalty points. In general, each occupant of a passenger car is required to wear a safety belt or an appropriate child restraint. The driver of a vehicle is obliged to ensure that an occupant of the vehicle who is under 17 years of age is either restrained by an appropriate child restraint or, provided she or he is four years old and upwards, is wearing a safety belt.The requirements to wear a safety belt do not apply in respect of the use of a vehicle in which the fitting of safety belts is not mandatory. For cars first registered before 1 June 1971 seatbelts are not required in any seating position. Cars registered between 1 June 1971 and 31 December 1991 are required to have safety belts fitted to the driver's seat and the outermost front seat. Cars registered on or after 1 January 1992 are required to have safety belts fitted to all forward facing seats.The fitting of an appropriate child restraint is not mandatory. Accordingly, the duty of the driver to ensure that a restraint is worn is subject to the availability of such a restraint in a vehicle.The regulations define an appropriate child restraint as an approved child restraint that is appropriate to the user by virtue of the weight range indicated on the restraint. The regulations also specify approval authorities and approval marks.

Following policy directions from my Department to both CIE and Dublin Bus on 10 January 2001, Dublin Bus is required to notify my Department of proposed service changes, whether new services or changes to existing services. The policy direction to CIE was issued pursuant to section 26(1) of the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Act 1986. The direction to Dublin Bus was issued pursuant to section 19(7) of the same Act.The essence of the direction to Dublin Bus is as follows: the company must notify the Minister of proposed service changes, such as new services and changes to existing services, at least four weeks before the implementation of the proposed changes; it may not introduce any proposed new service or service change where the introduction of such a new service or service change would compete with a passenger road service in respect of which an applicant is seeking a licence pursuant to the Road Transport Act 1932 and where the Minister has provided notification that such an application has been received.I have received no formal notification from Dublin Bus in accordance with the direction on changes to existing services on these routes.

The 25% increase in capacity on the Maynooth line will be achieved in the coming weeks and, as a result, peak capacity will be increased from 3,300 to 4,200 passengers on the route. The new railcars will also facilitate the withdrawal of old carriages and lengthening of trains.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I understand from Iarnród Éireann that there will be an additional 30% in peak hour capacity on the Kildare suburban rail corridor within the coming weeks. Platform extension work at the stations along the route and a new turnback facility at Newbridge will be completed in time to facilitate longer trains and additional services. There will also be additional Portlaoise-Heuston and Newbridge-Heuston peak period services.In this regard, I want to correct for the record of the House, my reply to Question No. 1087 of 30 September 2003. In that reply an increase in capacity of 130% was indicated when, in fact, it should have indicated "130% of existing capacity will be provided".Further increases in the frequency of services are dependent on increasing track capacity. Iarnród Éireann is considering a plan to quadruple a section of the route between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch, as part of the Heuston Station and south west rail corridor development. This is expected to cost approximately €135 million and could take a number of years to complete. I have not yet received the company's specific proposals in this regard.

#JamesMcDaid	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-party	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-dob	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	431	In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. The age of the vehicle and consequently the first test due date are determined by reference to the date of initial registration with subsequent test due dates falling every two years after the first test due date. Neither the date of manufacture nor the date of ownership of the vehicle is a criterion in determining the test due dates. Where a national car test inspection does not occur on the test due date, the national car test certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date. This is to ensure that the car is again liable for a test in accordance with the test schedule laid down in the directive.The scheme of car roadworthiness testing was introduced on a phased basis beginning in 2000 with cars first registered before 1992, in 2001 with cars first registered between 1992 and 1996 and in 2002 with cars first registered in 1997 and 1998 and other eligible cars. The vehicle in question is a used import which was first registered on 1 March 1997. In accordance with the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2003, its first test due date was 1 March 2002 with its next test due date 1 March 2004. Following the successful national car test on 30 October 2003, National Car Testing Service Limited was correct in issuing a national car test certificate up until 1 March 2004.

Where a person is detected speeding on camera, the film must be viewed, by the Garda authorities, the registration details checked and a notice issued to the registered owner. If the registered owner was using the vehicle at the time of the alleged offence, he or she has up to 56 days in all to pay the fixed charge. If the registered owner was not using the vehicle, he or she has up to 28 days to return an alternative form identifying the driver. On receipt of this nomination form the nominated driver is then issued with a notice who in turn has up to 56 days to pay.At the end of each month the Garda Síochána forwards details of all fixed charge payments received during that month to the Department of Transport which in turn subsequently notifies the driver that the application of penalty points will take effect 28 days from the date of issue of the notification from the Department.Additional resources were allocated to the main Capel Street office in May 2003 to assist in the processing of fixed charge notices. The Garda authorities have advised me that this has resulted in the processing of such notices in a more timely manner.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the majority of criminal gangs in Dublin tend to be made up of criminals who are not affiliated to a particular gang but who operate on an ad hoc basis committing criminal offences with others who may be associated with one or more groupings as the opportunity for acquiring cash-property arises.For this reason it is virtually impossible to be precise about the number of such gangs operating in the Dublin area. In making application to the High Court pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 the Criminal Assets Bureau relies on material arising from any known or suspected criminal activity. Accordingly, for operational reasons it is not appropriate to categorise proceedings as being linked to particular criminal gangs or drug dealing only.However, the majority of applications to the courts under the proceeds of crime legislation during 2003 have in general been drug related. Additionally, the Criminal Assets Bureau continues to apply its Revenue powers under a statutory remit against persons involved in drug trafficking.

The agency also publishes an annual report the most recent being the air quality monitoring annual report 2001. Both publications assess the national air quality situation, predicated in the main on local authority monitoring data, resulting from emissions from, inter alia, the domestic sector.As regards emissions reporting, the agency is also the relevant national body which prepares national inventories of certain transboundary and greenhouse gases aggregated by sector, including the domestic sector. The general methods and data sources for the emissions estimates are set out in the Environmental Protection Agencys publication emissions to air 1990-1998 which also details emissions over this period. Further information on greenhouse gas emissions is available in the agency's national inventory report 2003 and the latest transboundary emission data, for 2001, is available in the Department's recent discussion paper on a strategy to reduce emissions of transboundary air pollution by 2010, or direct from the agency upon request.

Introduction of the levy has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers with a consequent positive environmental benefit.Revenues from the levy are paid into the environment fund, which also receives the proceeds of the landfill levy. The environment fund is used to support a wide range of waste management, litter and other environmental initiatives as provided for in section 74(9) of the Waste Management Act 1996, as inserted by section 12 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001. In addition, last month, I made new regulations, the Waste Management (Environment Fund) (Prescribed Payments) Regulations 2003 which will allow the environment fund to be used for a range of additional environmental initiatives and activities.

The campaign is comprised of two separate but related elements:
A waste awareness media campaign

This is a strong, creative, high quality multi-media campaign, designed to raise awareness of the need to address waste and to get people at home and at work to prevent, reduce, re-use, and recycle or compost their waste, and ultimately to reduce quantities for final disposal.
A waste communications strategy

This strategy will address general issues, public concerns, information needs, misunderstandings-misconceptions in regard to waste management and the measures required to deal with waste in an integrated way. The communications strategy will complement the extensive investment under way and planned in waste infrastructure.The breakdown of expenditure over the two elements of the campaign is as follows:

However, 2003 allocations from the environment fund provide for approximately €40 million to be spent on supporting and promoting such initiatives including capital waste infrastructure grants, operational costs of recycling infrastructure, environment awareness and the national waste prevention programme. Allocations for 2004 have yet to be finalised but will include commitments made in respect of allocations carried over from 2003.

This was then matched by local authorities, which brought total expenditure from public authorities to €560,000. Evaluation of projects is carried out by the local authorities in accordance with the specified evaluation criteria set out below:Departmental funds allocated to a project must be matched by a similar amount from the local authority. It is also desirable that the combined Departmental-local authority funding be supplemented from other funding sources to maximise the potential of partnership arrangements. Generally, up to 60% of project costs is available from the combined Department-local authority funding. Preference is given to projects where a significant amount of the cost, for example 40%, is being met by the proposer or from other sources.

DKM presented the study of house price statistics report in July 2001. One of the recommendations was the design and production of a mix-adjusted house price index.Following on from the recommendations set out in the DKM report, my Department appointed FD Systems and Mazars Consulting in April 2003 to develop and implement a new house price statistics system. A user group, comprising of representatives of all the major lending institutions and local authorities, has been established. This group provides a forum for data providers to have input into the specification of the type and format of data to be supplied to the Department.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The basis for introducing the present system of electronic voting is set out in reply to Question No. 190 of 6 November 2003. Many different types of equipment are used for electronic voting and counting in different countries. The system chosen for use in this country has been used satisfactorily in the Netherlands for over ten years and for some years in some cities in Germany. I am not aware of any authoritative report to substantiate the generalised allegation made in the question nor do I accept the thesis that manual voting is more secure or efficient than electronic systems.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I refer to the reply to Question No. 1322 of 30 September 2003. The position is unchanged.

The arrangements agreed between management and the relevant trade unions as a consequence of a conciliation conference facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission in 1997 dealt with a national re-grading of supervisory chargehands to foremen. This agreement did not encompass other issues such as subsistence.Following later negotiations with the trade unions, a higher rate of subsistence was conceded to all serving foremen in the Kilkenny district, with retrospective effect to 1 January 2001. Since the person in question had retired in 1999, he did not qualify for payment of arrears.

This consultation will be concluded as soon as is possible. Given the nature of work undertaken by my Department on the conservation and preservation of national monuments, I am satisfied that the cost of the kiln at the Kilkenny depot represents value for money.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Kildare County Council received a capital allocation of €1,642,000 for payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants in June 2003. Local authorities were requested to contact my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements to facilitate the re-allocation of funds and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Applications for additional funding, including one from Kildare County Council, are now being considered in this context and a decision will issue as soon as possible to the authorities concerned.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	462	My Department has been making good progress on a large number of capital projects in the built heritage area under the national development plan which commenced in 2000. Some examples are the conservation works at Kilfenora Cathedral, County Clare estimated at €270,000; a new visitor centre at Dunmore Cave, County Kilkenny, estimated at €7,000 and conservation works at the world heritage site at Skellig Michael, County Kerry, estimated at €23,000.At the moment my Department is undertaking a mid-term review of this programme and I will consider sanctioning specific projects when this review is completed.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the heath boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.With the exception of certain designated payments e.g. child benefit, the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme requires that all household income, whether in cash or in kind, must be taken into account in determining a person's entitlements under the scheme. Maintenance payments made in respect of both adults and children are treated as household income and all such payments up to €95.23 per week are fully assessed in determining entitlement to rent supplement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	466	As outlined in my previous reply, the implementation of this proposal in full in respect of all qualified children would cost approximately €185 million at current rates. There are a number of selective measures to support low-income families with children up to 22 years of age in full-time education.Employees on low earnings with families are provided with in-work cash payments through the family income supplement scheme. Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 if in full-time education. This supplement is paid where a family's net weekly income – gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation – is below a specified income limit for the family size. Over 12,000 families benefit from this scheme, receiving an average payment of approximately €60 per week.Also, as stated in my previous reply, entitlement to child dependant allowance has been extended to age 22 from October 2003 where the parent of a full-time student has been in receipt of a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more. The provision already applies to recipients of long-term payments.Any proposal to extend child benefit entitlement, even on a phased basis, would have to be considered in the light of available resources and competing budgetary priorities.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the state whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.Anti-social behaviour by a tenant is a matter for the landlord in the first instance. There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the private residential tenancies board. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.Given that these facilities are in place, as a matter of housing policy, I have no plans to make any changes to the social welfare legislation in this regard.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Section 12 of the Pensions Act 1990 provides that the pensions board may, subject to the prior approval of the Minister, engage such consultants or advisers as it may consider necessary for the performance of its functions. In practise, there is a delegated authority in force which allows the pensions board to appoint consultants without prior approval where the value of the contract does not exceed €31,740.Except in exceptional circumstances, all consultancy assignments are subject to competitive tendering. In the limited cases which have not involved tendering, I am satisfied that the award of assignments were in line with public sector tendering procedures.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the state whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards which have the function of deciding entitlement in individual cases.One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement relates to the amount of rent a person may incur. Each health board sets a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur, taking the household size and other relevant circumstances into account. This is to ensure that the rent is reasonable and that overly expensive accommodation is not being subsidised by the scheme. Taking the household's composition into account, the health board's maximum rent limit in this case is €130 per week. The person concerned had previously been advised that her rent of €155 per week was in excess of this limit. In accordance with standard practice in such instances, she was advised that she should make efforts to secure more reasonably priced accommodation or, alternatively, seek a reduction in the rent being charged by the landlord.

Following a review of his case the claim was disallowed with effect from 7 August 2003 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work.The person concerned appealed the deciding officer's decision to the social welfare appeals office. Following an oral hearing the appeals officer upheld the original decision and the person concerned was notified of the result on 31 October 2003. If the person concerned is in a position to provide fresh evidence that he is genuinely seeking employment, he can reapply for unemployment benefit.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-13 00:00:00	Prelude	471	A deciding officer disallowed payment in this case on the grounds that the person concerned had failed to disclose all her means. She has income which is not consistent with her declared means and she has failed to explain the discrepancy to date. She was informed of this decision and of her right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
