#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, comprises the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. Legislation underpinning the establishment of NESDO was published in April 2002 and when enacted will place the three bodies on a statutory basis as part of the office. The primary role of NESDO is to add value to the work of its constituent bodies by creating the conditions under which synergies can be released, joint projects pursued and the potential for duplication minimised.The office promotes the development of a shared vision for realising these goals and encouraging the constituent bodies to maximise their impact through collaborative policy development initiatives. In particular, it performs its role by facilitating and promoting complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion in the NESC, NESF and NCPP, providing shared administration and support services for the three constituent bodies and submitting to Government reports, recommendations or conclusions by a constituent body and arranging for their publication.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	When does the Taoiseach expect legislation to create this office to be introduced? Will the office manage the new partnership deal?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The legislation will be passed as soon as the House and the Whips can agree to do so. To date, however, it has been working on a non-statutory basis and this has not resulted in  any great difficulty; it does not affect its work in any way. The organisation was set up on a non-statutory basis some time ago. All the constituent organisations have since moved into one headquarters for administrative and other purposes.It will not be the function of the office to look after the partnership. The NESC plays a role in providing a strategic report every three years on what it sees as the key issues for the State to deal with. An overview of the NESC strategy, An Investment in Quality: Services, Inclusion and Enterprise, was published in November. That is their role in it. The priority of NESDO for the coming year is to promote complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion by the three bodies. It will continue to provide shared administrative and support services. It will report on various initiatives. The NCPP, the newest of the three bodies, is compiling a number of reports on how partnership would work in the private sector. It has done a considerable amount of work and will produce a number of reports during the course of the year on that issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	3	What is the extent of the cutback in funding for the NESC this year? Does the Taoiseach not consider that the cutback will seriously hamper its work in developing this new programme?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	4	One of the benefits of the three organisations joining together, using a single administration and sharing the overheads is that it will create a saving in 2003. The total estimate for the constituent bodies of NESDO in 2003 is €2.8 million, a saving of 8.6%. The corresponding figure for last year was €3.078 million. There has been a saving over the period but that is due to the administration. It does not affect the staff. The staffing rate of the organisations is still the same, except in administration.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	5	How will this body function? What is the top tier of management? Will there be a director and a number of deputy directors and will they report to a board? Will the board be located in the Taoiseach's Department? Is the body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The organisations are independent and have their own boards. The NCPP has nine staff: one executive chairperson, one director, five national co-ordinators, one executive secretary and one executive officer. The overall number of staff is a little larger. There are, effectively, two people with NESDO. The director is also the director of NESC. There are eight and a half staff with NESC, seven with NESF and nine with NCPP.There is an independent board and a research group that works for the organisations. The board comprises members of the social partners and independent personnel. Mr. Peter Cassels is the executive chairperson for the national centre for  partnership. There are four employers' representatives, four union representatives, three people representing my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, an assistant secretary from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and four academic members who represent the business schools and other areas where partnership is part of the academic studies.They are linked into 23 outside organisations who have a base or an interest in developing partnership within the private sector. They are combined into a national research panel which advises the centre on a wide range of research programmes. Second, a network of strategic alliance partners has been established to co-ordinate the efforts of key agencies and Departments at national level and to bring about radical change and improved performance in organisations in the private and public sectors.The centre's strategy sets out a framework within which the centre will work in collaboration with many organisations. It has a small staff. It will develop this work from its previous incarnation when it worked as a partnership body within my Department under the last—

When they amalgamated, they had their own subhead and accounting officer. They are not using any of the offices they previously used in my Department.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Having been a member of the NESC for a number of years, I would like the Taoiseach to outline where he thinks the synergy justifies the cuts already announced in the Book of Estimates in relation to the NESC. It seems NESC is in operation—

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am exemplifying the question by pointing out that the staff of the NESC—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is not appropriate for a Deputy to point out. The Deputy should ask a question for the Taoiseach to answer.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Given that the NESC has a staff of a director, three researchers and three secretaries, how can cuts be possibly justified at a time when economic intelligence has never been more necessary?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	14	As I pointed out in my reply to Deputy Kenny, the staff is 25.5 people.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	15	That is not the figure for the NESC.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The figure for the NESC is 8.5 people. The only savings achieved by bringing the three organisations together are that they do not have to rent separate offices – although the people who were in my Department were obviously not paying rent – and overheads are lower because they are using the same administrative staff. There have been no other savings – they have just used their facilities in a more effective way.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.It is estimated that the total projected cost in 2003 for the communications unit in my Department will be €273,471, excluding any subsequent benchmarking award. The total cost for 2002 was €256,335. Some €108,941 of the 2003 figure and €97,218 of the 2002 figure is a direct cost to my Department with the remainder being borne by the five other Departments who have staff seconded to the unit at an average cost of €32,906 each in 2003 and €31,827 each in 2002.The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public. The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensure they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. It is conservatively estimated that, in a full year, the communications unit saves Departments approximately €175,000.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Departments have ceased the practice of paying commercial agencies for the production of transcripts? What was the overall expenditure on media relations, photographic services and advertising for 2001? Figures given last year seem to indicate that, in the Taoiseach's Department,  some €30,940 was spent on photographic services even though the Taoiseach is well enough known around the country. Any time this question is raised, the Taoiseach is at pains to point out that this saves money and is good value. Will the Taoiseach comment on those points?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	19	To the best of my knowledge, the contract arrangements in place for all Departments for using outside services has ceased. They may seek transcripts or tapes of programmes on some occasions that would not be covered. The communications unit covers a range of programmes and media outlets, but not all of them. That practice saves a substantial amount of money.I gave information in response to questions on photographic services last week to a Deputy. I am not sure what the amount involved covered. I do not believe it covered the taking of photographs of me as enough people already do that. I have not followed the practice of some sporting organisations of charging for that.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Since the Taoiseach has done so for everything else, he will probably consider doing that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I am not sure what other photographs were covered. If the Deputy wants that information, I am sure I could find that out for him.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Taoiseach made a remark last week that he would much prefer to watch young lads play football than read about such coverage in the newspapers.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The Deputy is right.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	24	My addition may not be absolutely correct, but it seems that, excluding advertising, the cost of media relations and photographic services for all Departments amounted to more than €9 million in 2001, which seems an extraordinary figure. Given that we are living in uncertain economic times, perhaps the projection of Government and Government faces should be seriously examined. If we are to lead by example, then example should be given from the top down.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I agree fully that we should get the best value for money. Another Fine Gael Deputy tabled a question to me regarding the full cost of all advertising in the national media – whether on RTE, TV3, local radio or local newspapers – for my Department. The cost involved is approximately €280,000. I checked this morning to ascertain how that amount of money could have been spent in this area. I noted that approximately €240,000 was spent on the Forum for Europe. When the cost of some of the statutory advertisements is excluded, there is almost nothing left. Deputy Kenny should check the details of some of the figures and he would realise  that the cost involved is not as excessive as might be thought from merely noting the global figure.

Are staff in the unit tasked specifically with addressing this important aspect of the Taoiseach's work? Does the unit address the regularly repeated erroneous reports that appear in the media in relation to these important areas? Can the Taoiseach clarify whether the communications unit also addresses the British media or if that is a function of the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Government press office? What are the lines of demarcation in that area?On a lighter note, the Taoiseach referred to a question in relation to photographs. There was a significant increase in the expenditure on photographs last year as against 2001. Was that increase due to the Taoiseach having become more photogenic or was it due to the fact that there was a general election in 2002? The Taoiseach might share that information with the House.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The amount should have been less because I would have been in my Department less often than I have been there this year or in a normal year.In reply to the Deputy's first question, the communications unit has no function whatsoever in either commenting on or having any influence over any of the media. It merely reports what the media are saying, and it provides that service not only for Ministers but for a large number of agencies across Government. The Government press secretariat deals with both the international and domestic press, and the communications unit has no such function.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Does the Taoiseach agree that expenditure on this kind of presentation to the media is out of hand. What exactly are 11 staff  doing in communicating to the media from the Taoiseach's office? What is this business of providing a service to Ministers? According to an article in Ireland on Sunday, the Tánaiste has five media staff in her office. According to the article, every Minister—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Deputy should put a question please.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	36	What service does the Taoiseach's office provide to Ministers who, according to the Ireland on Sunday article, were staffed to the astonishing tune of €20 million in 2002? That is €20 million to spin the Government's line to the public, including €250,000 on photographs alone. How can that be justified? Most people outside the House do not understand that most front benchers in this House operate on a man-and-a-dog basis. They have no back-up, aside from a poorly paid secretary. That is the entire back-up for front bench spokespersons in this House. How can the Taoiseach justify the imbalance between the resources he allocates to the Executive and the resources that are allocated to the Opposition? Commitments entered into by the Government and, expressly, by the Minister for Finance, in terms of providing an element of research back-up for the Opposition have essentially been reneged upon. We will now start from a baseline—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	37	In fairness to Deputies Boylan and Kenny, whom I ruled out of order for making statements, the same Standing Order must be applied to every Member of the House, and I ask Deputy Rabbitte to confine himself to asking a question.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	38	That is as it should be. I agree with you, a Cheann Comhairle. I ask the Taoiseach whether it is untenable to continue to run Dáil Éireann by allocating huge resources to the Government side of the House to spin the Government's position while leaving people on this side of the House dependent on a secretary who also has to support the TD in his or her public representative role of serving a constituency. Is it not the case that every Minister has a staff of approximately five or six people in his or her constituency office? This is not acceptable and cannot go on. As Deputy Kenny said—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I ask the Deputy to resume his seat and allow the Taoiseach to reply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	40	There is a staff of six in the communications unit and it is a Civil Service function, as I have pointed out many times in this House. Its role is not to spin on behalf of the Government – if anything, it gives the media spin to the Government. It reports what the media are saying on various issues, so the Government is not spending enormous amounts  of money on putting out its own message. If one follows the logic put forward by Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny, this is a useful service.I know that Deputy Rabbitte worked in the Department he talks about and he knows that the five people in that Department constitute the press office of the Department. It is not correct to portray the press office of any Department as serving the individual Minister of that Department—
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	41	That was the case when I was there.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	42	It is the Deputy's business if he abused it for his own interests. It is not the case—
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	43	We all know what happens.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I am afraid the Deputy does not know. The Deputy talked about the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Members of the press and others who wish to seek information about that Department contact the Department. That is how they work, and the Deputy knows that is true because that is the way it worked when he was in office.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Of course that is true, but is the Taoiseach implying there are no PR people for Ministers?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Most Ministers in this Administration do not deal personally with staff in their departmental press offices. That was also the case in previous administrations. I do not think Ministers would deal with them. They may have their own staff—

I cannot let Deputy Rabbitte get away with saying there are no resources or funding for others. That is not the case and I do not need to remind the Deputy of the resources that are available to the Labour Party that were not available a few years ago. These resources are open to the party for research purposes and I do not need to tell the Deputy of the substantial funding it receives.

The Taoiseach said the unit had "no function whatsoever" in this regard. His subsequent answers clearly indicate that it has a function. I presume the communications unit does not ignore all matters on the North of Ireland and the peace process. It must have some function. Will the Taoiseach revisit the answer he gave me in the first instance and address what the communications unit does about erroneous reports? What steps, if any, has he put in place in his Department to address the continual negative and inaccurate spin that is often applied by sections of the media hostile towards the vision of the Good Friday Agreement? Does the communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach look at and address the detail in this area in the British media?If we are not all to get the staff required to address the problems highlighted by Deputy Rabbitte and others, why does the Taoiseach not share with the parties and the Technical Group the information the communications unit provides? That would overcome the problem and it would be an equitable approach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Deputy asked me if the communications unit has a function in amending or ordering action on what he termed "erroneous reporting" on Northern Ireland. The communications unit does not carry out any of those functions. It has no role in this. If there is erroneous or inaccurate reporting, or something in between, the unit will report it. The Government Information Service, which is also part of my Department, deals with local and national press. I draw a distinction between that service and the communications unit.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I have. Some Members of Opposition parties are considering bringing to the Labour Court the issue of the rates paid to secretarial staff in the Houses.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I fail to see how that arises out of the questions under discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It ought to be examined in the interests of equity and the job being done properly.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	67	In light of the fact that the Taoiseach spoke repeatedly about value for money, will he define what services are provided to the Government? He said a large number of State agencies are involved. Are all involved or do some hire private organisations to provide such services? If that is so, does the Taoiseach not agree it is a duplication of the service provided by the communications unit and is not value for money? Does the unit also monitor and report on debates in this House and the Upper House? Do photographic services include air brushing?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I am not answering questions about photographic services. Perhaps Members should table a question on that matter for discussion on another day.The communications unit deals with Departments, is part of Government and does not deal with other agencies. It monitors only the content of the national media, not the Houses. If something is reported in newspapers about the Houses, it will pick it up as a headline, but it does not report on them. It has no role other than with the national media.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	69	In light of the Taoiseach's response, would it not be more logical and better value for money for all State agencies to be serviced by the communications unit rather than their hiring the services of private organisations which is a clear duplication of the services provided to the Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	70	It is a service to the Government and, no more than any other such service, does not extend beyond Departments to other agencies.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	71	If the work of the communications unit is benign, is the Taoiseach prepared to have  the most recent report to his Department made available in the Oireachtas Library so that Members can see the work of the unit and how it assists the business of Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The unit has already received freedom of information requests. If the Deputy looked at his newspaper this morning, he will know what information we receive because the unit summarises that news. Six or seven years ago, Departments obtained the transcripts and tapes of news programmes and other events. This is now done by the communications unit. That is its function – to summarise the daily and hourly national news.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I take it that is a "no".
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I am still unclear as to the purpose of the communications unit. The Taoiseach said it is to spin the media to the Government, which is at least a new concept. Why can Ministers not spin the media to themselves? They have personal spindoctors at considerable expense to the State. Why is an office in the Department of the Taoiseach needed to tell Ministers' spindoctors what the media is spinning on a given morning? Why can the spindoctors not do it? I fail to understand the point of the exercise. When multiplied by 15 for Ministers and 17 for Ministers of State, it is costing the taxpayers a fortune.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	75	A question please.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	76	How can the Taoiseach seek to glibly justify the unit on the basis of spinning the media to the Government? These people are able to hear and see what is in the media for themselves.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The Deputy is making a statement.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	78	If they are not, do they not have plenty of staff to do it for them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts to ensure Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant new developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public. They operate for 18 hours per day on three working shifts. As the Deputy knows, this is not what happens in other Departments, where there is not such a range of people. If the Deputy really wants it, I can give him details of how many people were engaged as advisers and in media services five years ago, compared with now. I could do that, but I have been declining to do so.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Taoiseach should go ahead.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Given that the Taoiseach referred to the advice of the media on Government performance, how does this communications unit operate? Do the media come to the communications unit for advice or to give advice? How often does that happen? Does the communications unit go to the media to offer advice or to look for inspiration? How often does that happen, if at all? At these times of financial revision and restriction, does the Taoiseach consider that the funding of the communications unit and the various departmental communications units might be better spent on the schools building programme, services for people with disabilities or a host of other areas that are crying out for financial input at present?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Those working in the communications unit do not go talking to anybody. They take what is in the national and some of the local media and portray the headlines and data as it comes across the airwaves to Ministers, Ministers of State and departmental heads who would not normally be listening to those programmes or are unable to listen to them all at the same time, so that they are up to date with what is happening and are able to respond to matters. They can supply detailed transcripts of interviews and matters of importance, when required. That saves conservatively about €175,000, which was the amount being spent about six years ago. The entire cost at that time is probably now saved by this service.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	83	During the Cold War, the CIA had listening posts all around the former Soviet Union. Is the communications unit the Taoiseach's personal listening post as far as the Irish media are concerned? Is its function really to see that its Government masters are not in its view slighted or misrepresented by the media? Has it a specific instruction in regard to radio programmes, for example, to immediately alert the Taoiseach or another Department if it feels a Minister has been slighted so that he or she can retaliate quickly?Is the communications unit different from the spin doctoring and propaganda unit of the Taoiseach? Is there a division of labour between the listeners on the one hand and those who spin out the Taoiseach's line by making lengthy telephone calls late at night before the Sunday newspapers come out, etc., on the other? Is that a separate unit? Is the Taoiseach's figure of €273,000 for the six staff really a gross underestimate of the cost to his Department of the whole communications business, not just the listening but the spinning as well?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I have already provided the information the Deputy requested. The communications unit is not involved in activities other than reporting and summarising what has been listed. A detailed summary of newspaper headlines and some 7 a.m. radio news headlines  is faxed to the homes of Ministers and Ministers of State each morning and an electronic copy of it is made available to more than 100 users throughout the Departments at 7.30 a.m. The main news bulletins are summarised throughout the day. Summaries of "Morning Ireland", the lunchtime news, the evening and 9 o'clock television news programmes, current affairs programmes, "Prime Time" and "Questions and Answers" are also available.The communications unit's role is confined to reporting the media in a more efficient way than would be the case if every Department used separate services, as they did previously. I do not give political direction to the individuals involved, nor do I have to. They merely prepare the report and send it out to 100 individuals across the agencies.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I expected "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and "You're a Star" to feature on the list. On a serious note, is the information gathered by the communications unit transmitted directly or indirectly to the press offices of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Progressive Democrats Party, or to their respective backbench Deputies?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	86	No, it is a service provided for the Government. The unit has no involvement whatsoever with any Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats offices or backbenches. It is a Government service which is provided only to Ministers and Ministers of State and the departmental agencies I mentioned.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I repeat my question to the Taoiseach. How can he stand here with a straight face and suggest that the purpose of the communications unit is not quintessentially political? Its purpose is to kill off stories in the media concerning issues raised by community organisations, trade unions or Opposition spokespersons.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	88	A question, please.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I am asking the Taoiseach if this is not the case.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Deputy is making a statement.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I apologise, Sir, and will do my best to correct myself. Is it not the case that the purpose of the communications unit is to kill off legitimate criticism of the Government and target people in the media with an overpowering army of spin doctors on the Government's behalf? The Taoiseach has more spin doctors running his personal office than Louis Walsh has promoting his latest pop group.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I totally reject that accusation. The reality is the communications unit takes what is presented in the media every day and reports it. It does not have a political nature. I do not see how reporting what the national media is  reporting in a succinct way so that people are informed of what is being said and what is going on is killing off anything. People cannot listen to every programme. Even early in the morning most of the recipients of the report would be attending meetings. They receive an update of what is going on throughout the day. It is nothing more than good sense to communicate what it is happening in the outside world. I reject all the accusations.

Does the remit of the communications unit extend beyond national radio, television and print media to local radio and newspaper coverage? Is it also the case that the articles and reportage highlighted does not always solely reflect on what Ministers and their respective parties are articulating or how it is being reported, but also on how the Opposition parties are raising issues, presenting their case and articulating their arguments? It comes down to—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	94	A brief question, please. We are approaching the end of question time.

Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will be prepared to challenge the Taoiseach to explain the reason he does not answer questions as quickly as he challenges me when I do not ask them.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The Chair has no responsibility for answers.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I will hear a brief question from Deputy Gilmore, who has not yet submitted a question.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Will the Taoiseach make available the product of this thriving little industry to the public by way of the Internet? All these transcriptions ought to be capable of being posted on the Department's website. Will he agree to post on the Department's website the transcriptions, which I presume are conveyed electronically to the other Departments, and make them available to the public so that everybody can see what this latter day version of GCHQ is doing?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Deputy Ó Caoláin asked again if this is a case of somebody watching us watching them. As I have said about 40 times, it is merely  a summary of what is reported in the national newspapers and on radio.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	101	National, but what about local?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	102	They do not cover local papers. They pick up on one or two of the main local radio stations in Dublin but only in a limited way. They do not report anything about what Deputy Ó Caoláin or any other Member said. It is not a case of reporting what the Deputy said. They take no account of that whatsoever.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	103	That is why we are doing so well.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It is a service for Government. It would be the same question—
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Is that just Deputy Ó Caoláin? Does it not report on other Deputies?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Nobody whatsoever.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	108	If the Deputy is mentioned in the paper, they would report it but as he is never mentioned in the paper, they would not refer to him. To answer Deputy Gilmore, it is—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	110	There are no spins on the end of it like those put in Labour Party documents on how it does things. It is all straightforward and up-front.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The answer is the same as what I said about information for Government. It would be like saying that any other internal information for Government should be put on the Internet.

I have already ruled you out of order. There were other Deputies offering and we ran out of time. Taoiseach's question time is 45 minutes. I call the Tánaiste.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 204 together.The annual competitiveness reports, produced by the National Competitiveness Council, comprehensively survey the competitive position of the Irish economy on the international stage. These reports examine key competitiveness issues, presenting a picture of the unfolding competitive position across the economy.The 2002 report confirmed many of Ireland's strengths but the council also highlighted the many challenges we face and the difficult choices which we have to make as we face an uncertain economic environment. It is clear that both the domestic Irish economy and the global economy face difficult times ahead. Given that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world, it is important that steps are taken to position the economy to maximise the benefits and growth potential from any upturn in the global economy.The Government is already taking action to address the deficiencies identified through strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance, continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as roads and broadband telecommunications and increasing investment in research technology and innovation which will provide the basis for future productivity growth.Sustaining competitiveness is a dynamic process and it requires sustained attention and ongoing commitment to achieving progress over a wide spectrum of areas. It has been a key underpinning element in the proposed new social partnership programme. The issues of concern in a competitiveness context, therefore, cover a wide range of issues and are the responsibility not just of Government but of all economic players.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	140	It is clear from the Tánaiste's reply that she has no initiatives to propose which will tackle the rapid deterioration of our economic competitiveness. Does she agree that by deliberately increasing cost pressures the Government is causing job losses directly? Over the past eight months there has been an 18% increase in costs to Irish businesses and households while the Government has binged on an increase of 40% in public expenditure. We have a tax and spend Government and many of our firms are seeking tenders for world-wide business from low cost locations in eastern Europe. Given the national pay talks she has just concluded, will the Tánaiste indicate clearly the initiatives, if any, which are to be taken to improve this country's competitiveness and to ensure the recent trend in job losses will stop?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Deputy Hogan is somewhat ill-informed. The Irish economy is a very open one and 60% of our jobs depend on our export performance. The economy has grown substantially because we have embraced export growth and because we have been attractive to foreign direct investment. That continues to be the case. The Irish economy is doing far better than any of our competitor economies in Europe and the world but the reality is that ours is not a low cost economy. We do not have a low wage economy and I do not want us to return to being a low wage economy. We compete in high value-added activity and if we want high value-added jobs with good salaries and conditions then we must develop our skills base and productivity, which will be based on skills.That is why, notwithstanding the relative reductions in public spending, the Government has spent so much on science and innovation, for example. We recently attracted 80 of the top research teams from around the world – from Japan, the US and other countries – to carry out research in Ireland. That is an investment in competitiveness and the future. There is no doubt there are pressure points; inflation is a huge pressure point and much of Irish inflation is caused by low interest rates, oil prices and external factors but much of it is also caused by domestic factors. The Government is determined to ensure we introduce competition in areas where we have artificial constraints and there is no competition. I hope we have Deputy Hogan's support in that regard, as I read some worrying things—
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I am worried about what the Tánaiste is doing.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	143	—about people trying to introduce competition. I am not sure the Deputy wants to embrace that.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The people have more to worry about regarding what the Tánaiste is doing rather than what I am doing. Despite going through the process of social partnership in recent months she  has no initiatives with which to tackle inflation or deal with our competitiveness.We were fifth in the league of nations according to the World Economic Forum report on competitiveness in 1996. We are now twenty-fourth. That is an indication of the Tánaiste's failure. When it comes to the Finance Bill will she reverse the decision on the abolition of CGT on roll-over relief which was proposed in the budget? Will she reverse the budget decision on the 1% increase in VAT? Will she devote more resources to State agencies whose funding was cut in the budget, such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA? Will she accelerate publication of some of the reports commissioned by the Competition Authority in order to deal with some of the blockages in the economy? Does she agree that the increase in stamp duty from 6% to 9% for non-residential businesses, which is hitting the commercial sector, is a real slap in the face for those who are innovative? It is doing irreparable damage to improving indigenous job creation.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The Deputy criticises what he calls public spending increases and then suggests a host of areas where public spending should be increased.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I am pro-enterprise.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	152	If grants were to solve the problem—
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I am not talking about grants.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The Deputy asked me to put more money into Enterprise Ireland, among other suggestions. If grants were the answer to our problems we should have had full employment in the 1970s and 1980s, when we were heavily dependent on grants. The reality is that there are pressures, which is why we must be conscious of the wage deal. That focuses on wage moderation and while it is an 18 month deal regarding wages, it is a three year deal for the rest of the programme. That is realistic in the current uncertain environment.We live in uncertain times and notwithstanding the Deputy's comments, the economy continues to perform very well. We are conscious of the pressure points and regarding the 87 indicators examined over the past year, we did better in 24, we were constant in 14 and we worsened in 29. The story is not as black as the Deputy paints it. There are difficulties but they are being tackled.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	155	The breakdown for construction related fatalities reported to the Authority over the past five years is as follows: in 1998 there were 22 fatalities, 19 in 1999, 24 in 2000, 23 in 2001 and in 2002 there were 22. So far in 2003 there has been one construction-related fatality. In addition, the breakdown of non-fatal accidents resulting in more than three days absence from work over the past five years is as follows: in 1998 there were 664 notified non-fatal construction accidents, in 1999 there were 601, in 2000 there were 1,108, in 2001 there were 1,059 and in 2002 there were 1,121. So far in 2003 there have been 14 notified non-fatal construction accidents.My officials are currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a weekly basis to progress the new Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Bill which will provide a legislative framework for health and safety for the next decade and beyond. I expect to have the forthcoming revised Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Bill published in mid-year and this Bill will place greater responsibilities on employers and will introduce heavier fines for health and safety breaches.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	156	It is an appalling state of affairs when the Minister of State can read out a list of almost two dozen fatalities for each of the past five years, while each year more than 1,000 people were presumably seriously injured and missed work. Since the Tánaiste took over, her Department has been smug and complacent about these levels of fatalities. As one of the protesters said a few weeks ago—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	157	A question please, Deputy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	158	—if 22 nurses or journalists were killed the House would pay more attention. Does the Minister of State agree with Mr. Tom  Beegan, chief executive officer of the Health and Safety Authority, when he says there is a culture of non-compliance throughout the construction industry and that the Department has signally failed to address this? There is a management failure on almost 50% of sites and these deaths are caused by managers and companies in the construction industry. This is deplorable.The Minister knows I used to represent my party in this portfolio – I am substituting for Deputy Howlin today – and when I did I brought forward a Bill which the Minister refused to introduce for five years. It will have taken at least six or seven years before we finally see some decent legislation. The Minister is prepared to leave it to Mr. Justice Kelly and other decent judges to put gangsters who run construction companies behind bars. The Minister should have taken legislative action; his and his fellow Minister's records are absolutely appalling.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Twenty two deaths on construction sites in 2002 is 22 deaths too many. All of us condemn and are concerned at the level of accidents in the construction sector. Progress, however, has been made in recent years in prevention and awareness measures. A safety, health and welfare at work Bill will be introduced in April of this year. It is complex and extensive and my Department and the Parliamentary Counsel are giving high priority to publishing it as soon as possible.The construction industry has been notorious in the past for being negligent about safety in the workplace but since the establishment of the Construction Safety Partnership and a range of other initiatives, there is a much better culture of prevention and awareness in the industry. Changes have taken place. There is mandatory safety representation on sites with more than 20 employees and mandatory safety training with registration cards and there are safety officers and defined roles for site safety representatives. These regulations came into effect on 1 January 2002. The FÁS safe pass safety awareness training programme is now training more than 185,000 people in the industry, with 300 tutors in place. The safety representative project has enabled the appointment of safety representatives on all sites.I accept what the Deputy says and I agree that this is not enough. I have asked the construction industry and ICTU to meet my officials and me to establish why the continuing significant efforts are not yielding better results. I have also asked for new codes of practice to be introduced in certain areas immediately, such as below-ground work, where it is clear building companies and builders are not following the existing codes.The HSA is vigorously pursuing through the courts any case where employers or building companies are found to be negligent and we will continue to pursue those cases aggressively. Also, there will be greatly increased fines and jail sentences in the new legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Is the Minister prepared to  incorporate in the legislation two of the issues raised by the building workers a few weeks ago outside this House – legislation for the crime of corporate manslaughter and a penalty points system for the administration of sites?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I am prepared to consider the proposals made by some of the construction workers. It is a complex area and we must look at the legal implications.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I share the concern and disappointment of the Deputy at the recent loss of jobs in a number of companies in County Monaghan. I recognise that in addition to the impact these closures have on the workers and their families, there is a significant effect on the economic life of the areas involved.Where difficulties arise for companies, or where major job losses occur, the full services of the agencies of my Department are available to work closely with the companies involved in addressing the difficulties arising and to provide whatever assistance possible to the workers affected.I note that of the four plants identified by the Deputy, three are still operating. In the case of one of these, while there has been a reduction in employment numbers over the past 12 months, I am not aware of any plans to close or to further reduce employment. In the case of the other two companies, in the event of failure to maintain the businesses as going concerns, the facilities will be marketed by the agencies with a view to securing their take-over as manufacturing operations.Despite recent setbacks, we can be confident about the future of County Monaghan and its economic development. Job vacancies remain very buoyant, with over 1,200 applications for work permits from employers granted last year and a further 180 work permits sought since 1 January 2003. The county's location within the Objective One region, together with the recent designation of Monaghan town as a hub in the Government's national spatial strategy, leave the county well placed to benefit from future investment inflows.The State agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Monaghan County Development Board and county council, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. Enterprise Ireland is currently facilitating a num ber of new start-up businesses in the prepared consumer foods sector, to be based in the Lough Egish Food Park, and is also working with the furniture industry in the county in relation to design and technology. Also, with IDA support, a company servicing the consumer foods market was recently established in Carrickmacross and employs 60 people. It is anticipated that this number will increase as the company goes into full production.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	163	There have been some significant changes since I submitted this question; CPV Limited can now be saved. Is the Tánaiste aware, however, that in recent times County Monaghan has suffered a quadruple whammy? The closure of Monaghan Poultry Products meant the loss of 300 jobs, 99 jobs were lost in CPV in Clones, 60 jobs in Lissadell Towels in Carrickmacross and 60 jobs were lost in Montex Holdings Limited in Monaghan. Yesterday, in neighbouring County Cavan, Teradyne announced that it was removing its operations from the area.We are seeing the erosion of long established industries, all of which produced high quality products. In most situations, we exported much of the produce, bringing much needed funds into the State. County Monaghan will slide into a depression unless urgent action is taken by the Tánaiste to set up a task force to seek alternative industries.We have been told that balanced regional development is the objective of both the national spatial strategy and the BMW authority. We want to see evidence of that with the establishment of a task force and a hands-on approach. Development must be targeted at County Monaghan. We are aware of Monaghan's newly acquired hub status but this requires both industrial and infrastructural development throughout the country. We are reliant on the indigenous industries of mushroom growing, furniture and shoe manufacture.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I am aware of the position in the companies mentioned by the Deputy. The main reason for this is loss of competitiveness in sectors under intense pressure from low wage economies and this is certainly not a low wage economy. Also, to a large extent County Monaghan is heavily dependent on agricultural industry or basic manufacturing.The IDA is discussions with CVP Limited about the current situation. Its difficulties arise from extremely difficult market conditions coupled with the build-up over the past four years of compensation claims from employees, currently estimated at €1.5 million. To improve efficiency, CPV initiated a voluntary redundancy programme in November 2002 and 40 people availed of it.If a task force could solve the problems, I would gladly establish it but it is not that simple. The designation of Monaghan as a hub and its  Objective One status will make it more attractive for a better balance of investment than has previously been the case. I hope new investment will be in areas other than agriculture and basic manufacturing, similar to the investment announced in Roscrea this afternoon. We must bring investment from that sector to counties that have not experienced high value added activity. The IDA tells me the pipeline for such investment is good for this year and Monaghan will benefit from that.

There are 99 jobs involved and the company has a full order book. The problem is that the parent company wishes to sell off the company. It is a profitable company and jobs can be saved. I ask the Tánaiste to intervene. This is a rare situation. The only thing holding back the sale is an IDA Ireland grant issued eight years ago, which has about one year to run.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Yes, there is an outstanding grant of €400,000 from taxpayers' money. Clearly, that is a matter for IDA Ireland and there are legal commitments in that regard. We have to protect such investment in companies but that is not a matter for me. It is for the agency involved to negotiate in relation to those matters. However, in the event that the company cannot be saved, it would be a priority to find an alternative investor. I understand that another party may well be interested in that facility and that will certainly be pursued.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	169	The proposed introduction of carbon tax is in response to our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Taxation is one of a number of measures included in the national climate change strategy, which sets out a framework of mechanisms to help Ireland to meet this international commitment. While the introduction of a general carbon tax from the end of 2004 was signalled by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech last December, I should mention that the tax framework has not yet been developed. The Minister made it clear that given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consul tation with interested parties on the design of the tax. This commitment to consultation is reiterated in the draft social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which states: "In keeping with Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the announcement in the budget regarding the development of a general carbon tax, there will be full consultation with the social partners, having regard to the potential implications for jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion."I expect the Minister for Finance will initiate consultations to develop a framework for the tax shortly. My Department will be fully involved in the development process, where important issues for discussion are likely to include the level at which the tax will be set, the question of exemptions or reductions for companies engaged in other greenhouse gas reduction measures such as emissions trading, negotiated agreements and the question of recycling the tax. In developing the tax framework, a crucial consideration will be minimisation of any impact on competitiveness.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	170	There are two parts to my question. One part relates to carbon taxes, which I consider extremely important, and the other relates to general stealth taxes currently affecting industry. During questions to the Taoiseach earlier, there was much talk of the Government's communications unit. However, that appears to have failed to get the message across to the Government with regard to the massive loss of jobs throughout the country and the perception by industrialists and business people that the reasons for the downturn are stealth taxes, increased inflation and the general increase in costs which are the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. There have been massive increases in rates and waste disposal taxes—

Carbon tax is a worrying issue at present and industry needs to know where it is going at this stage. I have read a document from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment expressing grave concern about the potential impact of carbon tax on industry. Yet, the Tánaiste has indicated that there are no specific proposals coming forward.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I thank the Deputy. All those matters are placing pressure on the global economy and Ireland will succeed or falter on the basis of our performance in that global economy, with 60% of our jobs depending on our export performance.In relation to carbon taxes or any other taxes, there are, clearly, different ways in which taxes of this kind can be introduced. It is important to bear in mind other strategies which companies put in place, such as trading emissions, for example. That is facilitated within the EU. It would have been premature to introduce such a tax. I am not sure whether the Deputy is for or against the tax, although I know his party is in favour of it.

In reply to Deputy Hogan, it depends on how the tax is introduced. I am not in favour of any tax that puts Irish jobs at risk.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	190	We must move on. A very brief relevant question from Deputy Murphy.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Some of the impact of carbon taxes could be avoided if the Government got its act together in relation to the production of green energy. This country has enormous potential for wind energy production. There is lack of co-ordination and a solid Government policy in this sphere. Does the Tánaiste accept that the Government needs to get its act together on this issue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The allotted time has been exceeded. We must proceed to the next question.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Concerns both at national and international level about proliferation of dual-use and military goods, as well as associated activities, have increased considerably in recent years. At international level, the concerns have been strongly expressed in the various fora dealing with non-proliferation matters. The 11 September attacks in the US, as well as recent developments in other regions of the world, have inevitably heightened international anxiety in this regard.Given the increasing focus on the necessity to strengthen strategic export control rules, it is important to ensure that Ireland's export controls are up to the best international standards. In this context, my Department has asked Forfás to undertake a review of our strategic controls systems with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen them to ensure full  compliance with Ireland's international obligations. Economic consultants have been commissioned by Forfás to carry out the review, which has just got under way.The review will be undertaken in two phases. Phase one of the exercise will involve the consultants interviewing the main parties who have a role or interest in the area of export controls. The objectives of this phase are to define precisely the study objectives, specify the specific issues to which this gives rise and identify the work that is needed to carry out the subsequent full phase two project. In this regard, it is envisaged that phase two will involve a much wider consultation process. I see no reason the reports submitted under the review should not be made publicly available. Clearly, the issues to be identified and any decisions to be made arising from the review will have to await conclusion of the review.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Does the Minister agree with the results of the recent Amnesty International report, appropriately entitled "Decoding the Deals"? The title is also appropriate for a Department where the Minister has been in office, in coalition with Fianna Fáil, for almost six years. Does the Minister agree that as a result of the Amnesty International report it could be argued that if a company wanted to deliberately set up a system of licensing with a view to specifically frustrating parliamentary scrutiny of these dual use military exports, then Ireland would be the perfect model upon which to place it? While there is some acknowledgement that the report currently under way may be published, may we have a guarantee that it will be, and an indication of the timing?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	195	With regard to the licensing issue, many countries do not have legislation covering licence production agreements, that is, where a company allows another company to manufacture controlled products under licence. While there are no specific controls in Ireland on licensed production, important activities associated with this issue are subject to control. For example, any transfer of technology related to the manufacture of military items would be subject to national export licence requirements. Similarly, an export of any specifically designed parts or components related to the licensed production of military goods would also be controlled. While there is no reason to believe Irish companies avail of licensed production agreements to avoid our export control system, the previous Minister of State had indicated support in principle for the introduction of controls on licensed production. With regard to the other question the Deputy raised, we have no objection to the report being made publicly available.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	196	We are told the Government's policy is the promotion and protection of human rights, that that is at the heart of Irish foreign policy, and yet there is no scrutiny of these mili tary exports taking place. Is there an interim measure which can be introduced which would facilitate the setting up of a scrutiny committee of the Dáil to begin this process?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	197	The list of military items subject to export control is set out in orders made under the Control of Exports Act 1983 and the most recent list is contained in the Control of Exports Order 2000. The list largely reflects the Wassenaar Arrangements munitions list. The WA is one of a number of international non-proliferation regimes of which Ireland is a member. Any items being exported must get clearance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and also are subject to criteria set down by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I remind the House of the one minute time limit on supplementary questions and also on the answers to those supplementary questions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I understand the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner, though it is likely to take some time to complete the process. Unfortunately, efforts by the liquidator to sell all or part of the assets of the company on a going concern basis have been unsuccessful to date.The liquidator has also advised me that based on legal advice received he has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments. It is estimated that these claims increase the total value of unsecured creditors compared with the statement of affairs produced by the board in November last by more than €60 million, though any dividend payable to the workers concerned will be reduced by the amounts received from the ex gratia fund of €24.5 million provided by the shareholders. It is expected that these additional claims will have the effect of reducing the prospective dividend to unsecured creditors generally.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The decision by the Minister and the Government to close IFI with the loss of 620 jobs was not because of Iraq or any world-wide competitiveness issue. It was a direct decision of the Government. We now realise from the Minister's reply that the information given at the time was largely unsubstantiated, that there is an  additional burden of €60 million on the State for unsecured creditors of the company or the employees will pay the price for it – it is one or the other. What will be the changes to the pay-out to employees arising from what she has just said, where an additional €60 million for unsecured creditors is required? Second, when will payment be made to the creditors who were promised they would be paid in a short period?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I would remind the Deputy of the time limit.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	202	When will the disposal of the property take place and will it be by public tender?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Some of the latter questions, as the Deputy will be aware are entirely a legal matter for the liquidator. It is not appropriate for anybody to interfere. It is a matter for the liquidator to decide at the time. We have had many discussions about this.The closure of IFI happened because substantial public moneys had been invested over a long period in this company and it still continued to have very serious difficulties. It was not justifiable in the current circumstances to invest more public money, more taxpayers' money, in a company which just could not succeed. Ireland is not unique among European countries in not being able to sustain a fertiliser industry.There are no implications for the taxpayers in the contractual arrangements of the workers. They are unsecured creditors. Under the existing agreed arrangement of the ex gratia payment and the statutory payment, they will get on average €50,000 per employee. Depending on what the liquidator realises for the company but based on the best estimate, with the changed circumstances they will get perhaps another €25,000 per employee. However, they will be unsecured creditors like other unsecured creditors and they have to take their position in the queue in that respect.The creditors will be paid. Obviously secured creditors will be paid first. The Government and the other shareholder have decided not to look for our money back for the loan we gave the company and that makes available to the liquidator more than €34 million extra towards meeting the liabilities to creditors. I hope they can be paid as quickly as possible but that entirely depends on the speed at which the liquidator can realise resources from the sale of the assets.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Is it not true that the ex gratia payment is working out at less than two weeks per year of service? The Minister mentioned average payments. What is her estimate as to the highest payment an employee might get and the lowest payment an employee might get? Will this average of less than two weeks per year of service be a benchmark for other such closures that the Government might contemplate or that private industry might undertake?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I do not have figures for the highest and the lowest payments, but I can tell the Deputy that the average payment is €50,000.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	206	The Deputies should welcome the extra money for workers. The pension fund is fine too.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	They have been paid their statutory redundancy and I understand the ex gratia payment will be paid very quickly. It is estimated that the new arrangement will probably deliver on average a further €25,000, bringing the average to nearly €75,000 per worker. If that is the average, obviously some will get substantially more and others, depending on the length of service, substantially less.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Will the Tánaiste give some indication of when she will be in a position to know the full extent of the liquidator's report and the full details of the winding up of the affairs of the company? Will she submit that to the Deputies at the earliest possible opportunity because there have been changed circumstances related to the House today. If any other additional information comes to her in the near future from the result of the liquidation of the company, will she make it available to Deputies, particularly Deputies from the area concerned as well as the spokespersons?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Yes, I will be happy to do that, subject to legal advice. I do not think there is any reason that information cannot be made available. I will make whatever information I have available to the Deputies later this afternoon.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	210	One of the main challenges in the area of employment policy has been to increase overall participation in the labour force to maintain competitiveness in what is still a tight labour market. Government policy has responded to this need by encouraging, inter alia, female participation, which has increased from 42% 1997 to 50.1% in 2002.An important component of the Government's strategy on reconciling work and family life and developing family-friendly policies has been the introduction of legislation such as the Parental Leave Act 1998, the Carer's Leave Act 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. This legislation, combined with increased maternity and adoptive leave entitlements and the development of child care services, will facilitate greater participation by women. The Government is also committed under the national  development plan to meeting the diverse needs of parents and children, including key target groups, by supporting the development of accessible, high-quality child care services.A number of agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are also adopting new initiatives designed to facilitate the increased participation of women in the workforce. The IDA has identified six of its existing business parks for the development of child care services, which will benefit both employers and employees and thereby enhance the attractiveness of the IDA parks to international investors. Gateway for Women is a FÁS initiative tailored to meet individual needs and focuses on addressing the concerns of women returnees, such as flexibility of training and accessibility of services. These measures are complemented by the development of child care services, which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Minister of State said a few weeks ago that at least 27,000 women – out of more than half a million on home duty – were anxious to return to the work force. Yet I notice that Gateway for Women has only about 1,000 places. Ms Gráinne Healy, chair of the National Women's Council of Ireland, noted recently that the availability of child care places is still a major problem for tens of thousands of women who would like to return to work. Is it not the case that the Minister, along with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has refused yet again to address this seriously?We know from documentation that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, wanted to cut the number of places on the community employment scheme to 15,000, but she was overruled. We also know that FÁS fought for at least 22,000 places. We found this out under the Freedom of Information Act before Christmas.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 112, 127 and 143 together.Council Regulation No. 1334 of 2000, as amended, provides the legal basis for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology. Dual-use goods are defined as goods which could be used for both civilian and military purposes.  The regulation sets out the list of dual-use goods that are subject to export control and is updated regularly to take account of EU member states' obligations as participants in various non-proliferation regimes. It is within this legislative framework that Ireland meets its international obligations to control dual-use items.The list of military items subject to export control is set out in orders made under the Control of Exports Act 1983. The list largely reflects the munitions list set out in the Wassenaar Arrangement and the common list of military equipment covered by the EU code of conduct on arms exports. The most recent list is contained in the Control of Exports Order 2000. While Ireland does not have an arms industry in the normal meaning of the term, a small number of companies produce, as part of their product lines, items that are listed in the Control of Exports Order and accordingly are subject to export control. Applications by Irish companies for military export licences are subject to the strictest examination by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the criteria contained in the EU code of conduct. End-use assurances are necessary in respect of all such applications.Ireland is committed to working in all relevant forums towards the establishment and improvement of arrangements for better monitoring of arms brokering activities. Our objective is to devise a clear framework for legitimate brokering activities and to inhibit undesirable activity. EU member states are addressing the problem of control of arms brokering. Discussions have centred on guidelines and procedures for monitoring this activity. Some member states already have national legislation on the subject. It is hoped that an EU common position can be agreed as soon as possible on the agreed guidelines that can be used as the basis for national legislation in the matter. Concerns at national and international level about proliferation of dual-use and military goods, as well as associated activities, have increased considerably in recent years. At international level, the concerns have been strongly expressed in the various forums dealing with non-proliferation matters. The attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, as well as recent developments in other regions of the world, have inevitably heightened international anxiety in this regard.Given the increasing focus which is being given to the necessity to strengthen strategic export control rules, it is important to ensure that Ireland's export controls are up to the best international standards. In this context, my Department has asked Forfás to undertake a review of our strategic control systems with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen them and ensure full compliance with Ireland's international obligations. Economic consultants have been commissioned by Forfás to carry out the review, which has just begun. The  review will be undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 of the exercise will involve the consultants interviewing the main parties, including Amnesty International, who have a role or interest in the area of export controls. The objectives of this phase are to define precisely the study objectives, specify the issues to which this gives rise, including the issue of parliamentary scrutiny, and identify the work that is needed to carry out the subsequent full phase 2 project. In this regard it is envisaged that phase two will involve a wider consultation process. Clearly, the issues to be identified and any decisions to be made arising from the review must await the conclusion of the review.

The Minister has given a long answer assuring us that our system is good. The NGOs in this area would say the opposite. Does he think there should be a Oireachtas committee similar to the one recently established by the House of Commons? That is what I asked in Question No. 109.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The Taoiseach visited Mexico in January last. Enterprise Ireland welcomed the opportunity to participate in the visit by the Taoiseach as it gave an opportunity to raise the profile of Ireland in Mexico, present a strong platform to develop links to the Mexican market and provided Enterprise Ireland clients with an excellent opportunity to strengthen and deepen their links with actual and potential Mexican customers.The companies that participated in the trade mission were chosen to reflect the cross-sectoral opportunities that currently exist in Mexico. A total of 18 representatives from Enterprise Ireland's clients participated in the mission and these engaged in more than 80 meetings with Mexican customers and potential customers. The  major sectors represented by Enterprise Ireland's clients on this trade mission were the software, engineering and educational sectors. The mission also included the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Irish Dairy Board, which had their own programmes. During the visit the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland held meetings with the major trade organisations, the Ministry of Economics and the premier bank in Mexico.While it is difficult at this early stage to quantify the actual impact of the trade mission in terms of, for example, deals done or partnerships formed, Enterprise Ireland is confident that, in the medium to long-term, client companies will secure significant business in Mexico. A formal review process on the visit is now under way. Based on information currently available to Enterprise Ireland, it can be stated that all the participating client companies are of the view that their participation was well worthwhile for the following two reasons. First, the presence of the Taoiseach gave the mission, its participants and, indeed, Ireland, a high profile in the local Mexican media. Second, as the Enterprise Ireland breakfast was hosted by the Taoiseach, this enabled the companies, through the ambassador's invitations, to attract the presence of senior representatives from their targeted actual and potential customers. More than 200 representatives of Mexican industry attended the breakfast.

During the visit our solidarity with the Mexican people in the 19th century, in the battle for Texas and so forth, was recalled. Were any mechanisms put in place whereby companies which Enterprise Ireland assists in Silicon Valley in California would be enabled, through the North American free trade agreement, to enter the Mexican market more freely? Will the Minister outline the current state of the export trade to Mexico?

That is a threefold increase since 1997. In 2001, the last full year for which information is available, Mexico was our 21st largest export market and Ireland had a trade surplus of almost €310 million with Mexico.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Taoiseach's moment of truth on Iraq has arrived. He will have to remove himself from the traditional comfort zone of the fence. Last week the Taoiseach had difficulty answering a straight question on this issue because, he said, he wanted to wait and see what would happen. Something has happened. The inspectors have made some progress and over 100,000 people in Ireland have marched, as have millions more worldwide. It is time for the Taoiseach to seize the day and declare his position on Iraq. This is a matter of both leadership and democracy, not to mention the primacy and legit imacy of the United Nations. The Taoiseach wants a second resolution and has said as much. He also said he wants to work with the United Nations. We need to hear that again. We also need an answer to one other question. Does the Taoiseach support unilateral action against Iraq in the event of no sanction being given by the United Nations? That question requires an answer of one syllable, "yes" or "no".
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Matters have moved on a good deal since last week. Our consistent position of support for the United Nations Security Council was extremely useful in yesterday's debate. Kofi Annan's remarks on that yesterday were also clear. We believe, and Deputy Kenny holds the same view, that a united approach within the Security Council is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and, therefore, in achieving what everybody wants, a peaceful resolution to the crisis.The members of the European Council took full account of the deep concern of everybody who marched last week. I will report to the House in greater detail later but every EU government is anxious to avoid war. We want the disarmament of Iraq to be achieved through exclusively peaceful means in accordance with Resolution 1441. That is why we are putting so much pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply. In my view, war can still be avoided. Already, Resolution 1441, and the credible threat of force which underpins it, has resulted in progress and perhaps there will be more progress now.We will continue to support the Security Council. We have been doing that successfully and determinedly even though we have received criticism for doing so. However, it is the right thing to do and we will continue to do it. We will remain with Kofi Annan and the Security Council on this issue. Let us hope that support gets us what we all want which is full compliance with the 17 resolutions laid before the Security Council and the latest one, which we also support.On Deputy Kenny's final point, that matter may arise some day and perhaps it will not. I hope none of these issues arises and that Saddam Hussein is forced into a position where he will comply. I am heartened at this weekend's meeting and statement by Arab leaders and Foreign Ministers. They are due to have another council this week. Last night it was agreed there would be further contact between the European Union and the leadership of the Arab states who will in turn put pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I am interested in the Taoiseach's line of thought. His reticence in answering is causing confusion regarding the serious consequences referred to in Resolution 1441. If the Taoiseach is opposed to war, in favour of the United Nations and in favour of Saddam Hussein disarming, which we all are, surely it means that if we support the primacy and legitimacy of the  United Nations, we should be opposed to unilateral action without UN sanction. This is as much about that legitimacy as it is about anything else. In the event of the United Nations not giving sanction for an invasion of Iraq, what will be the position of the Taoiseach and the Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I listened carefully to what 15 heads of state, the European Parliament and Kofi Annan have said, and nobody is giving any end line positions, nor will they.

In our view, Resolution 1441 means we should do everything we can to avoid conflict and get disarmament and a peaceful resolution, including a military build-up to succeed in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. This man has ignored everything for 12 years. If Resolution 1441 was about trying to put pressure on him, it is working – Kofi Annan made that clear yesterday – and that vindicates the position of assisting in that build-up. We will continue to stick with the Security Council.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Does the Taoiseach accept that the largest demonstration of Irish citizens since the PAYE tax marches in 1979 was a spontaneous expression of disappointment at the failure of the Government to represent their views? What did he convey to his fellow European leaders at the summit meeting? What did he say about the French-German initiative for a non-military solution? Does he accept that the remit of the UN mandate is the identification and destruction of weapons of mass destruction and not regime change and that countries which posit regime change as an objective are acting outside the mandate? Will the Taoiseach declare, at a minimum, what Ireland's position is in the event of pre-emptive unilateral action being taken?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	250	In their contributions yesterday, the French and Germans made it unambiguously clear that their number one position is to see compliance with Resolution 1441 and to see Iraq disarmed. Deputy Rabbitte is correct that Resolution 1441 is not about regime change, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have said several times.Let us remember that Iraq has refused to comply with UN Security Council resolutions for over a decade. In addition to the 17 resolutions tabled to date, Iraq has continued to ignore everything else that has been said. France and Germany said we should call on Iraq to allow the weapons inspectors immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transport, and a strong line was taken on that issue. It was noted  by the European Council that six million people marched last weekend and there was a strong desire to seek a peaceful resolution. That will be achieved if Saddam Hussein changes his position, stops ignoring the Security Council, the world order for peace and security, and starts complying in a serious manner. There has been welcome progress but we must see more.As Kofi Annan made clear yesterday, if that is not the case, the Security Council will have to face up to its responsibilities. He made that same point on 8 November, 8 December, 20 December 2002 and on various dates in January 2003. This country's strategy is to follow the Security Council and try to force the changes from the Iraqi authorities to comply with Resolution 1441. If they do not, the Security Council will have to face up to its responsibilities and the matter will be discussed then. Ireland is not on the Security Council but Kofi Annan's position is clear. He is not prepared to allow the Iraqi regime ignore what he has been trying to achieve for a dozen years.

I did not ask him what Kofi Annan's position was. What is the position of the Irish Government in the event of a unilateral strike? Does the Taoiseach accept the UN estimates that there will be 100,000 direct casualties and 400,000 indirect casualties and that 30% of children under five are at risk of death by malnutrition in the event of a strike? Did the Taoiseach tell his EU counterparts the depth of feeling in Dublin last Saturday? Is it not a travesty of the issue that he should send out the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and that the Taoiseach should support him by making outrageously hypocritical and erroneous suggestions to the effect that 100,000 people were on the street in support of Government policy. They were there against Government policy and angry that no policy is being articulated.

We have done our best, including spending time on the Security Council, to support and assist that organisation in bringing a resolution to this matter. We stand totally behind UNSCR  1441 and will give our support to a second resolution although we are not on the Security Council. I will not answer hypothetical questions on matters that may or may not arise. We got an emphatic statement from the European Council yesterday, which I hope will help in the resolution of this conflict.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	256	On 15 February the world, through every time zone, witnessed an elemental movement of humanity in opposition to the barbarity of what a war on Iraq would mean, and it has obviously left the Taoiseach cold. He came in here today after an historic day, by any barometer in our world, and repeated the same mumbo jumbo he repeated last week and the week before, which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has also dished out to us. Does the Taoiseach agree that a yawning chasm divides the great bulk of the ordinary people of Europe from much of the political elite in Europe? Does he agree that in this State, in particular, a huge chasm divides the views of the ordinary citizens and those of the Taoiseach and his Government? In continuing to afford US military facilities in Shannon, does the Taoiseach agree that he is in opposition to the vehemently stated wishes of the Irish people?I ask the Taoiseach, the Government and sections of the media to come clean; the Taoiseach knows perfectly well that the reasons put forward for attacking Iraq are fraudulent from start to finish. He knows that if Saddam Hussein shoots as much as a peashooter outside his border, he will invite obliteration. Therefore, does the Taoiseach agree that this is not at all about alleged weapons of mass destruction, but about the United States wanting to extend imperial hegemony over the Middle East and corral oil resources for the next century?

I will continue to support the Security Council of the United Nations. I will continue to support Resolution 1441. I will continue to support a peaceful resolution to this issue. I will continue to support the international support for Saddam Hussein to comply in this regard, something he has failed to do for the past 12 years and which not only the international community but all his neighbouring states have asked him to do. People want peace and the way we can have it and avoid war is by getting a total fulfilment of the resolution.As Deputies Rabbitte and Higgins said, I am well aware of the humanitarian position. I am also well aware that a quarter of children under five years of age in Iraq die. I am aware of the enormous humanitarian position that exists in Iraq for the past 12 years because the leader of that state, who received 99.8% of support in an undemocratic election, continues to give no say to the ordinary people—

That is why children die. Does the Taoiseach know how outraged the taxpayers of this country must have been today when they learned that the Government is subsidising US military aeroplanes over-flying this country, that while we marched on Saturday about 19 military aeroplanes carrying weapons of mass destruction to attack Iraq flew over our airspace and that the Government subsidised them by paying the cost of air traffic control and so forth? Does he consider that is an outrage and will he withdraw that facility immediately, as Austria has done?Does the Taoiseach know that, according to the most recent opinion poll, voters in every age category, social group and region oppose his policy of continuing to afford Shannon as a facility?

I will continue to support the decision of the European Union to try to get a peaceful resolution of this issue, to avoid war by maximising pressure and, as Chancellor Schüssel said last night, to force the Iraqi regime to once and for all listen so that everybody can get on with peaceful co-existence – the only person who is not listening and who is refusing to make progress is Saddam Hussein – and the effort hopefully will continue to do that. In the meantime, this country, as we did yesterday, will continue to play a constructive and consistent part – people can criticise it as much as they like – in helping and pressing ahead to try to find a peaceful resolution to this in the only way that we can, which is compliance with Resolution 1441 or any further resolution.

Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform propose to bring forward legislation granting local authorities power to set their own pub opening and closing hours? Does the Taoiseach not consider this typical of somebody who never served on a local authority—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Before I address in detail the proceedings of last night's European Council, I wish to say a few words about the general situation regarding Iraq. We are at a defining moment in international relations. Events in coming months will have an important impact on world security for years and possibly decades to come. A united approach by the United Nations which results in the full implementation of UN resolutions on Iraq will be a signal that a multilateral approach to world security is both viable and effective. A result that sees the United Nations marginalised or its resolutions flouted can only  signal a move to a more dangerous world environment. As the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, said last night:What has happened in Iraq, or what happens in Iraq will not happen in a vacuum. The broader our consensus on Iraq, the better the chance we can come together again as an international community and deal effectively with all the burning conflicts in the world. And that is extremely important because when you look around you, we have many many difficult issues to tackle.Ireland's approach from the beginning has been based on the need to respect the role of the United Nations and international law. As a member of the Security Council, we played a key role in building the unanimous support for Resolution 1441. As one of the world's smaller and militarily neutral countries, Ireland has a vital national interest in a world order based on the rule of law and the primacy of the United Nations. We are proud of our tradition of support for the UN and the Government has no intention of departing from that. It is incumbent on all in the House to deal with this issue in a calm and responsible manner. Failure to do so can only have negative repercussions for the national interest.I attended the extraordinary meeting of the European Council held in Brussels yesterday evening. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, also attended. The conclusions agreed by the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, addressed the meeting and made forceful and constructive interventions. The European Council meeting was very productive and I congratulate the Greek Presidency for the constructive efforts it made. The meeting demonstrated the broad range of agreement among the members of the European Council, despite the continuance of differences on timing which still have to be resolved. I am happy to say that Ireland made a significant contribution to the shaping of the agreement arrived at last night. I am pleased with the level of consensus reflected in the conclusions of the meeting.The clear outcome of this meeting was to state again the European Union objective of full and effective Iraqi disarmament and the desire to achieve this peacefully. The Government's position, set out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Dáil last Tuesday, is that inspections should continue for as long as the inspectors feel they are productive but that they cannot continue indefinitely in the face of Iraqi non-compliance. A united approach in the Security Council and in the European Union is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations. Only full compliance with his obligations can secure the peaceful resolution of this crisis.The members of the European Council in their  deliberations yesterday took full account of the deep public concerns about the possibility of conflict. Every European Union Government is anxious to avoid war. This is the reason we want to see the disarmament of Iraq achieved through exclusively peaceful means, in accordance with Resolution 1441. This is also the reason we are putting so much pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply. The build-up of military force is part of that pressure. War can still be avoided. Resolution 1441 and the credible threat of force which underpins it have resulted in progress. The return of UN inspectors to Iraq after four years is a sign of progress. Saddam Hussein still has a chance to comply with the demands of the Security Council. He should do so promptly and unequivocally.This is the third occasion in four weeks that the House has considered Iraq. It is right that we should devote considerable time to this issue. There is a great deal at stake, not least the authority and legitimacy of the United Nations. Ireland has worked long and hard to achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis as we have worked for peaceful solutions to other crises over the years. The thrust of the United Nations Charter, which we fully support, is to find peaceful solutions. Force should only be used when all other possible means have been tried and failed.Ireland has been to the fore in the United Nations from the outset of our membership in working towards preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This current crisis therefore touches on two fundamental areas of concern to us. At the meeting yesterday, we also agreed on the need to address the increasing dangers posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Iraq has refused to comply with UN resolutions for more than decade. In addition to the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council from 1990, Resolution 1284 of 1999 called on Iraq to allow UN inspectors "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transport". Iraq has repeatedly failed to comply with resolutions of the Security Council and to live up to its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.Resolution 1441 of last October was designed to give Iraq another chance. It stated that Iraq should provide the arms inspectors with unconditional access to sites and persons. It directed the heads of the arms inspection teams to report immediately any interference or failure to comply.A number of speakers, including Kofi Annan, pointed out yesterday that there was a great degree of pessimism in the run-up to the adoption of Resolution 1441. Nonetheless, persistence, co-operation and a spirit of compromise enabled the Security Council to agree that resolution unanimously.After lengthy and intensive debate, in which Ireland as a member of the Security Council took an active and constructive part, agreement was  reached on Resolution 1441 on 8 November. This left the issue firmly within the framework of the United Nations Security Council. This is where Ireland wants to see the issue dealt with and where further decisions should be taken. We continue to believe that Resolution 1441 offers the best prospect of achieving our three principal objectives. These objectives are to obtain Iraq's voluntary compliance with its disarmament obligations, to avoid a military conflict and to uphold the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.Above all we must preserve the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland has always been a fully committed supporter of the system of collective security, with the United Nations and the Security Council at its very centre. European Union leaders last night pledged their full support to the Security Council in the discharge of its responsibilities. It is now up to Iraq to discharge its obligation under Article 25 of the Charter whereby all UN members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.Kofi Annan said last night:If the Security Council manages to resolve this crisis successfully and effectively, its credibility and influence will be considerably enhanced. If, on the other hand, the international community fails to agree a common position, and action is taken without the authority of the Council, then the legitimacy of and support for that action will be seriously impaired.I agree with that assessment. This is why the Government has consistently spoken out and used its influence at every opportunity, in every forum and in all its meetings, including at yesterday's meetings in Brussels, to urge the need for a peaceful solution. We have insisted that all means short of force must be tried and that force may be used only as a very last resort. We have repeatedly warned of the dangers, which would inevitably result from military conflict, and we have called attention to the threat of large-scale loss of life, casualties and human suffering. We have pointed to the risk that conflict could destabilise a region, which is already volatile. We have pointed out that extremists and terrorists would seek to exploit growing tensions between the Muslim world and Europe and the United States. We have spoken of the possible disruption of economic growth. We have laid particular emphasis on humanitarian concerns, as Ireland always has in such circumstances.It is our strong view that the inspections should continue as long as the inspectors and the Security Council consider they serve a useful purpose. At the same time, like the Secretary General, we recognise that the inspections cannot continue forever. Ireland has repeatedly stated its view that if Iraq continues with non-compliance, the  Security Council will have to assume its responsibilities as provided for in Resolution 1441. Any action to be taken to bring about full compliance should be decided in a second Security Council resolution. The arguments as to whether a second resolution is a legal necessity are a distraction from the real point. The compelling political reality is that a second resolution will signal the unity and resolve of the international community and the clear legitimacy of any subsequent military action.On the basis of the inspectors' report to the Security Council last Friday, the Government believes that the inspectors should continue their work, but continued and real compliance by Iraq with UN resolutions is essential. The ball is again in the court of the Iraqi leadership. That is and will continue to be Ireland's position.The European Council yesterday discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We agreed on the need to invigorate the peace process in the Middle East and to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The road map agreed by the Quartet, consisting of the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia, should be implemented rapidly.Last night's meeting was a step in the right direction. It will, I hope, enable the European Union and the international community to unite around our common objective, a peaceful solution based on the primacy of the United Nations.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I am both pleased and relieved to note the summit was a success. To achieve cohesion and unity of purpose among 15 member states was necessary and desirable. An achievement, though overdue, is better late than never. That said, as the leader of a party that has always believed passionately in the European project, I regret that such cohesion could not have been reached some time ago. In particular, this should have happened before Europe divided along the political fault line called unilateral action and before the diplomatic fiasco involving eight European countries so that the emergence of the tags "Europe old and new" could have been avoided.To maintain cohesion in this matter, I call on the Greek Presidency to continue to monitor developments closely and to maintain regular contact with the member states as events unfold. Serious consideration should be given to convening further special summit meetings if major developments occur in relation to Iraq. Only through such close co-operation and communication can we maintain a common European voice in this crisis.This party has been working for some time on revising its political proposition, based on principle, not expediency. It is based on new politics, for a new people, for a new time. Our view clearly extends to Europe in this instance. The old order is indeed changing. We must leave NATO politics firmly where it belongs, in the last century. Com mitted Europeans, from the Balkans to the Atlantic, are looking beyond the structures of the Cold War to create a new security architecture, based not on isolation and fear, but on cohesion, trust and hope. Such a security architecture will carry and indeed amplify Europe's voice in world affairs, particularly in international conflict resolution.The Taoiseach is an exasperating politician. No matter how hard he has been pressed in the past three weeks, he has gone close to the wire, but he never gives the final answer. Perhaps this is a hallmark of his politics and style, but in his contribution today he has answered one half of the equation fully. Neither he nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs is a warmonger. He supports peace and has made a vigorous contribution towards that. He supports the primacy and legitimacy of the United Nations. On behalf of Ireland, he pursues a resolution of this conflict through exclusively peaceful means. He agrees with Kofi Annan when he said:If the Security Council manages to resolve this crisis successfully and effectively, its credibility and influence will be considerably enhanced. If, on the other hand, the international community fails to agree a common position, and action is taken without the authority of the Council, then the legitimacy of and support for that action will be seriously impaired."Yet, he will not go the final step and say that he is opposed to unilateral action against Iraq.I understand the pressure of being Taoiseach and a member of Government. The people, including many who marched last week, are deeply opposed to war, but are naturally concerned about the economic consequences of what could happen here. People have expressed to me very directly their views on the effects on economic investment in this country from the United States. This is real and means cheques at weekends, houses, mortgages, families, cars, lifestyles, work and the future.We have always been friends with the United States. We have long historical, social, economic, political and other ties with that country. However we are a sovereign people with our own Constitution and laws. Just as we respect the laws and regulations of other countries, so should they too respect ours. Friends sometimes differ. Our traditional stance has always been, as enunciated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to respect and adhere to the primacy, legitimacy and authority of the United Nations, and the Taoiseach has stated today he has no intention of departing from that tradition. Perhaps when the Minister for Foreign Affairs is answering questions on this later, he will say where Ireland would stand in the context of, for example, a second resolution not conferring a mandate for unilateral action. I know this is a difficult question.What the Taoiseach's failure to answer ques tions at the summit exposes is that under his leadership the Fianna Fáil Party has made the politics of the parish pump into an art, but is still joining the dots in respect of the European picture and beyond. The Economist on-line has a map of Europe on which one can click a dot over each country to find out how it is aligned. There is no dot over Ireland, meaning we do not have a position on a war which has the potential to change the world and instead confine ourselves to expressing support for the United Nations, although I accept this is important as in so doing we adhere to our traditional values.

As Members will be aware, she has just returned from an eight day visit to Iraq. The humanitarian consequences of a war are frightening. UNICEF has enough food stashed on the Syrian border to feed 600,000 people within 48  hours and has a warehouse in Baghdad with food valued at $1 million.The regime in Iraq has been brutal. Layer by layer, the people have been stripped of everything to the point where they are unable to resist or rise up. I share the Government's view that if Saddam Hussein was to comply with the UN resolution, the conflict would be avoided.I received an e-mail from San Diego a couple of days ago by a person who has watched from a hillside as aircraft carriers have steamed out of the bay for the past six months. These vessels will not return without having done some damage, which clearly indicates the strength of the commitment of the United States on this issue. Newspaper reports noting that a replacement for Saddam Hussein is ready to take power in Iraq and setting out a catalogue of events which will happen between now and the end of March call into question the value and importance of the Security Council's decision.Ireland could take a lead in examining the sanctions committee, which refuses to approve certain parts for medical equipment for importation to Iraq if it deems them to be of dual use. Presuming the mortality rate among young children in hospitals in Iraq is as high as we are informed, a series of Irish and European sponsored humanitarian visits to Iraq should be undertaken to ensure medicines reach hospitals there and can be used to benefit the country's children who are suffering from diarrhoea, malnutrition and other illnesses on a massive scale. Replies to questions I tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the past indicated that the Iraqi Government has not ordered medicines under the food for oil programme.We should explain to the Iraqi people that not all western countries are belligerent and that we want them to have the opportunity to live normal lives. Given that the Parc Group trained and worked with doctors and nurses in the Saddam Hussein Hospital in Baghdad prior to the Gulf War, there is already a connection between Ireland and Iraq, about which I understand the Iraqi people are aware. I ask the Taoiseach to take the next available opportunity to examine what medical equipment the sanctions committee has prevented from reaching Iraq.Available evidence suggests that if this conflict starts, as many as 16 million people will suffer severely from lack of nutrition and food caused by the ravages of war. As a country which has traditionally taken a neutral stance, it behoves us to be far more vigorous and proactive in terms of our approach to this issue. We should clearly state our views.No one in the House supports Saddam Hussein and the people of Iraq do not support his regime, which rules by oppression. The collective will of the international community can and will be brought to bear on what is, possibly, a worsening situation. War is always the option of last resort. The decision facing us is whether it would save  lives and reduce suffering. While there is no easy answer, principle can be a useful guide.In recent days I have spoken to people in the United States where security has been ratcheted up to close to the top of the scale and people across the country are buying gas masks and stocking up on water and tinned food. One has the distinct impression of a people living under a cloud of fear. Whether it is justified remains to be seen, but the threat of international terrorism is very real.

Perhaps the build-up of military forces in the Gulf will ultimately have a deterrent effect in that Saddam Hussein may decide to comply with UN resolutions. However, the rising weather temperatures in the Gulf make matters uncertain. If, at the end of another period, Mr. Blix is able to report that the Iraqi regime is co-operating and complying with the requirements of the weapons inspectors and inspections should, therefore, continue, it would be too hot for, or, as they say in the United States, not conducive to night fighting in the desert. The question is whether the White House would decide to take unilateral action at that point.I want to find out where the Government stands in the event that the United States decides to invade Iraq unilaterally without United Nations sanction. Will the Taoiseach tell the people where he stands and what the Cabinet has decided or will we have to wait until the final moment?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The 100,000 people who marched through Dublin last Saturday were not marching in support of Saddam Hussein or out of antipathy to America. I was in the march and I spoke to many people. These were people who in many cases had never marched in their lives before and had never felt the overwhelming urge to protest about an international issue. They were members of all political parties and none. They were people of all ages, classes and income groups. They were horrified at a headlong rush to war that could have untold and unforeseen consequences. They were horrified that the rush to war is being led by the most powerful democracy in the world and that our nearest neighbour is apparently seized of the same determination to start a pre-emptive war. These people were intelligent, questioning and thoughtful. There was no knee-jerk impulse among them, but a deep sense that something new was happening in the world. It is stupid and insulting to characterise the people who marched on Saturday as either anti- American or naive. Despite what the propagandists might say, people understand full well that Iraq does not possess the might of the Third Reich. Dictator and tyrant that Hussein undoubtedly is, he rules a country whose people are already broken, physically and in spirit.They know that if this war is a huge success in the eyes of the so-called coalition of the willing, a country will lie crushed by the onslaught of the greatest military power the world has ever known. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, will die in the short-term, with many more dying over time, and after Saddam Hussein has been killed or captured, terrorist attacks can still strike unsuspecting parts of the world and kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people.They know that if the war goes wrong, the entire region can be destabilised. If Hussein manages to hold out or if he manages to unleash some of the chemical weaponry he is still alleged to control, casualties could be huge on both sides and the legacy of a botched military effort could be many years of regional conflict, with other countries drawn into a war over the future of Islam and incalculable consequences, including catastrophic economic consequences, for the whole world.There are no good scenarios here, no possibility in this approach of a clean outcome. Does anyone really believe we can easily foresee a day when the happy people of Iraq, free at last of their hated dictator, will want to share their new-found prosperity with the rest of the world? Does anyone really believe this war, once it is under way, will have no casualties except people who deserve it? This war will not be a Hollywood adventure, it will be bloody, bitter and poisonous. Even if it is over quickly, there will be no winners.We should not be under any illusions either about what happened in Brussels last night. There are still palpably clear divisions in Europe between those who want to go to war now and those who want to find a peaceful solution. It is perhaps true to say that the real division now is between those who wish to find a way to disarm Iraq without war and those who are still bent on regime change.We need to be very clear on this point. The United Nations has adopted a wide variety of resolutions in relation to Iraq, going back to the first Gulf War. None of them mentions or endorses regime change. Resolution 1441, as we know, deplores and criticises Iraq again and again for its many manifest failures in relation to disarmament. It repeats several times the sense of threat Iraq poses to international peace and security through the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, but it also reaffirms the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Such a clause cannot be consistent with the entirely new principle that it is okay to go to war to secure a change of regime.I am surprised our Government, in supporting the European position, has managed to remain so  silent on the subject of regime change. The Irish Government is committed, under Article 29 of the Constitution, to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality and to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination. While that commitment does not preclude us from supporting action endorsed by the United Nations, and consistent with the United Nations Charter, it prevents our Government from acquiescing in, supporting or facilitating in any way a war whose purpose is to get rid of a regime we do not like.A week ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, addressed this House at length on the subject of Iraq. In a considered and detailed speech, he made no reference to the issue of regime change. If the Government has referred to this issue elsewhere, I have been unable to find it. I hope we will not complete this debate today without hearing the Government's position on this issue. Having regard especially to the fact that the concept of regime change by force is alien to the United Nations Charter, I believe we need to hear the view of the Government on this important issue.The Government has been voluble on the subject of disarmament. The Taoiseach is quoted in today's newspapers, for instance, as telling the European Council last night that "weapons inspections could not go on forever" and warning that the "authority of the Security Council was at stake". This is to misunderstand the inspection process.The inspection process consists of two parts. The first part is the finding and destruction of any weapons of mass destruction. The second is the continual monitoring of Iraqi activities. It is up to the Security Council, and the Security Council alone, to sanction action that may be required arising from the findings of the inspectors. What will do most damage to the authority of the Security Council is the unilateral unleashing of a war, without the authority or consent of the Council. In any event, it would make one wonder whether the work of the inspectorate is being taken seriously by the leaders who are discussing it. Only four days ago at the Security Council, Dr. Blix stated:I said that it seemed from our experience that Iraq had decided in principle to provide cooperation on process, most importantly prompt access to all sites and assistance to UNMOVIC in the establishment of the necessary infrastructure. This impression remains, and we note that access to sites has so far been without problems, including those that had never been declared or inspected, as well as to Presidential sites and private residences.In my last updating, I also said that a decision to cooperate on substance was indispensable in order to bring, through inspection, the disarmament task to completion and to set the monitoring system on a firm course. Such  cooperation, as I have noted, requires more than the opening of doors. In the words of resolution 1441 – it requires immediate, unconditional and active efforts by Iraq to resolve existing questions of disarmament – either by presenting remaining proscribed items and programmes for elimination or by presenting convincing evidence that they have been eliminated.In the current situation, one would expect Iraq to be eager to comply. While we were in Baghdad, we met a delegation from the Government of South Africa. It was there to explain how South Africa gained the confidence of the world in its dismantling of the nuclear weapons programme by a wholehearted cooperation over two years with IAEA inspectors. I have just learned that Iraq has accepted an offer by South Africa to send a group of experts for further talks.In other parts of his presentation to the Security Council, Dr. Blix is implicitly and explicitly critical of Iraq, but how anyone can interpret this report as a mandate for war baffles me. How our Taoiseach can say, against the background of that report, that weapons inspections cannot go on forever also baffles me. At what point should the weapons inspections stop and what should replace them?In our own country, we have some experience of how troubled and complex an issue disarmament can be. We know how it is tied up with issues of sovereignty and surrender, and we know that it is an issue that takes time, although the context is radically different. We have struggled with the issue of disarmament in Ireland since the first IRA ceasefire nearly eight and a half years ago, and we have still not made the progress we would wish, but none of us in this House has argued that we should give up on peace on that account.The effort to secure a peaceful resolution to the threatening issue of Iraq must continue. Before this debate ends, I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach that his every effort will be bent in that direction. We cannot and must not support or facilitate a war aimed at regime change, no matter how much we hate the regime involved. We cannot give up on the disarmament issue while the inspectors appointed by the United Nations are making progress.Is it not possible for a country like ours to lead the demand for peaceful disarmament through the United Nations? Why are we not insisting that the next step, in line with international law, ought to be Iraq's acceptance of a process that moves beyond inspection to actual disarmament? This is what Dr. Blix told the United Nations a couple of days ago:Through the inspections conducted so far, we have obtained a good knowledge of the industrial and scientific landscape of Iraq, as well as of its missile capability but, as before, we do not know every cave and corner. Inspections  are effectively helping to bridge the gap in knowledge that arose due to the absence of inspections between December 1998 and November 2002.More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples have been collected at different sites. Three quarters of these have been screened using our own laboratory analytical capabilities at the Baghdad Centre. The results to date have been consistent with Iraq's declarations. We have now commenced the process of destroying approximately 50 litres of mustard gas declared by Iraq that was being kept under UNMOVIC seal at the Muthanna site. One third of the quantity has already been destroyed.The disarmament of Iraq and removal of the threat can be achieved peaceably. This requires maintaining the maximum possible political and diplomatic pressure on Baghdad but no case has yet been established for a war that would kill hundreds of thousands. The message from Ireland must be the message of the people last weekend: we support peace, we believe the UN's objectives can be achieved through peaceful means and we oppose war.The approach of this Government since the crisis escalated has been to keep its head down, say as little as possible and hope that it will go away. Once again the Taoiseach appears to have been largely a spectator at last night's summit in Brussels. One would search the international media in vain to find any account of a proposal or even a contribution made by the Taoiseach at the summit. The moral and political issues raised by the threat of war will not go away. As a people we have a right to expect something better from the Taoiseach than sitting on the fence and sending the hapless Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on to Morning Ireland to suggest that the 100,000 people who marched through Dublin on Saturday were really demonstrating their support for Government policy.The Taoiseach was a recent visitor to Mexico and I know he is an admirer of the President of Mexico, Vincente Fox. Mexico is a country with a common border with the United States and is hugely dependent on Washington in terms of investment and general political goodwill. Last week President Fox spelled out the position of his country in the following terms: no to unilateralism, no to war, yes to peace and yes to the disarming of Iraq and the strengthening of the United Nations. Would that we had a leader who was prepared to show half the political backbone of President Fox.

I was impressed by those present, who were not hardened political  animals but fathers, mothers and children, the kind of people one sees out on a Sunday stroll. In some cases the family pets came along. However, this was no picnic. It was deadly serious. Some marchers had printed placards but many had placards they had made up at home with simple messages calling for a "No" to war. They shouted "no blood for oil" as they marched along in an expression of people power.There was also an expression of people power in the last election, when I was elected because the Government had not delivered in my constituency. People were fed up then that nobody was listening to them, and they were fed up last Saturday for the same reason. That was the reserved function of those who wanted to be heard. If there had been a general election last Saturday then Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would not be in power; they are damn lucky there was no poll last Saturday. The people wish to be heard but they have not been heard. They would not march if war was inevitable. It is not inevitable and they know public opinion can change the situation; otherwise there would have been no point in marching.The people have spoken loudly and clearly and the Government will be in great peril if it ignores this message, delivered so simply and clearly. The people who marched, like me, are not anti-America, yet they resent the use of Shannon Airport in the build-up to a war nobody wants. They are putting the responsibility to carry out their wishes on the shoulders of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs; they will be held responsible for stopping the use of Shannon. The people have spoken and they should be listened to.

It took a risk but it was one worth taking, as it is important we have an EU statement or agreed position on Iraq. We need that to act as a counterbalance to the threat of unilateral action by the United States. I was hugely relived by the statement from the Council that war is not inevitable. It seems crazy to have to say that, but until now I and many people like me have had an awful sense that war is inevitable – that there is a relentless grinding machine moving towards war. The EU statement gives me some hope.I also marched last Saturday, though in my home town of Sligo and not with the 100,000 people in Dublin. I was heartened to see so many people marching for peace because it sent a strong message to all politicians that the inspectors should be allowed to get on with their work and to proceed with disarming Iraq. The Taoiseach just said that the inspectors should continue as long as they and the Security Council consider they serve a useful purpose but I and many other Irish people want him not just to state that we back the UN but to make a statement on unilateral action by the US. However, if one backs the  UN position one cannot support unilateral action by the US. One cannot have it both ways.Kofi Annan urged EU Heads of State to concentrate on disarming Iraq. Under current conditions, with constant scrutiny by inspectors, it is unlikely that Iraq represents a substantial threat to world security. The EU statement also said the EU is determined to deal effectively with the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is very important because if the EU is determined to deal effectively with such weapons, then it must turn its attention to many countries, of which Iraq is only one. Perhaps in that context the art of politics may replace the act of war.I am no apologist for Saddam Hussein and his evil regime but we must continue to back the UN in its role as guardian of international peace and security. Kofi Annan's statement regarding the credibility of the UN being at stake in this situation gives me hope that a negotiated and peaceful resolution can be found. I also have a little more hope that the EU can play an important role in achieving that resolution.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Previous speakers have referred to last Saturday's march. It is amazing to hear Government spokespersons claiming that the marchers, including my party, myself and other Deputies from this side of the House, were on that march in support of Government policy. If that was the case, why was there no official representation from the Government? It is clear the Government is being insincere and is insulting people by claiming the march was in support of its policy.After the EU summit we now know that Government policy is to follow whatever others say, that it does not rule out the use of force and is prepared to limit the inspections, even though the Taoiseach said there should be as much time as might be needed. According to the official statement there is now a timeframe. That is a way of saying that we will go to war if we have to. If the British Government had taken that position at the height of terrorist attacks in Britain, or if the Good Friday Agreement were to stall, we would be here saying how unjust, unreasonable and aggressive such a position would be.It is clear that the people who marched on Saturday were of the opinion that violence and war will not solve this matter, certainly not the type of bombardment the US is planning. In the absence of any Government policy other than waiting to see what happens and jumping then, the people have been listening to those with credibility on this matter. The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War estimate that there will be between 48,000 and 260,000 civilian casualties in the first three months of a war without the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The Bush Administration has threatened to use such weapons so that figure will increase to even more frightening proportions. A report in The Guardian on 20 January stated that  a UN special task force estimated 500,000 dead or wounded, with 16 million out of 26 million people in danger of starvation. There were predictions in the European Parliament that there would be three million refugees and displaced people. These figures come from those who are not afraid to say what will happen.The Pentagon theatre nuclear planning document is frightening in the cavalier fashion in which it states that nuclear weapons will be used if necessary against bunkers, bunkers to which the weapons inspectors are expected to get access. The threat of nuclear weapons signifies not just a potential catastrophe for humanity but is also in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations. When the Taoiseach says we must respect the UN, we will be known by our actions.Kofi Annan has said the sanctions are not working and we should call for them to be lifted. If the British and Americans oppose that we should challenge them. The Government claims that it will go along with the primacy of the UN but is it not going along with the primacy of its charter, which does not allow for regime change. We cannot have it both ways. We are either with the UN or not and in its charter, it makes clear its limitations and its extent. We should respect that rather than deal with the US interpretation of what the UN can do.Dennis Halliday has made clear that Article 2.4 of the charter states that all "members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations". By going along with the current US-led policy, we are not just threatening global stability but are in flagrant breach of both the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.

Here on the streets of Dublin the message could not have been clearer. The Government may try to spin its way out of it but it will do so in vain. Last Saturday, 100,000 people told this Government it does not act in their name when it allows Shannon Airport to be used for the military build-up, when it uses taxpayers' money to facilitate the over-flight of military aircraft through our airspace, when it fails to speak out, when it sits on the fence or, worse, when it aligns the State with the powers leading the drive to war.The Taoiseach told marchers that the demonstration did not change the Government's position but he has now gone even further than that.  According to The Irish Times, he has boasted that allowing the use of Shannon is “a small contribution to a military build-up”. At the same time, Government Deputies have claimed to agree with those marching at the weekend and that the march was somehow in line with Government policy. Those who would offer us such contributions should not insult our intelligence. Better their silence.The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have nothing to be proud about from the outcome of the Brussels Summit, in fact the opposite is the case. They know that Resolution 1441 does not sanction force or war. They also know that the weapons inspectors reported real progress last week and that Hans Blix rubbished much of the alleged evidence presented to the UN Security Council by the Bush Administration. They know the dossier presented by Tony Blair and the British Government was a concoction and a sham. The Brussels statement had more to do with patching up the shaky relationship between the EU and the US, and relations within the European Union, than it did with resolving this crisis. The reality is that the UN and the EU have been sidelined by the Bush Administration and its British allies.In the days ahead we will see attempts to cobble together a second Security Council resolution. If it is done it will be nothing other than a fig leaf to facilitate the war that is all but under way. If a resolution is not cobbled together, it is clear that the US and British Governments are prepared to attack without a second resolution. What has the Irish Government said and done? The Taoiseach cannot bring himself to oppose a US-British attack without a second UN resolution.Already the Bush Administration has nominated the people it wishes to run Iraq as military governors after its invasion. For the first time in American history, the US is preparing to impose a direct colonial administration. The Kurds in northern Iraq are outraged that the Bush Administration has told them in talks that it has abandoned plans to introduce democracy in Iraq after the proposed invasion and overthrowing of Saddam.The EU statement, which the Taoiseach signed, states that "the Iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences". Of course, the Taoiseach knows that the people who will bear the consequences of this war will be the innocent men, women and children of Iraq, the very people who have suffered under Saddam and the appalling sanctions which have killed an estimated one million people.I make a final appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, echoing the voices of the 100,000 people who marched on the streets of Dublin last Saturday, not to make this State complicit in an unjust and disastrous war, not just for the people of Iraq and the Gulf region but, indeed, potentially for every citizen of this global village.

Trying to get information on this subject matter is rather more like trying to catch smoke rings with a net. We do not seem to have advanced any distance.In the aftermath of the discussions yesterday, has the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach given any indication to our European colleagues as to the likely position of the Irish Government in the event of the US proceeding unilaterally? For example, within the confines of the meeting yesterday, notwithstanding the communiqué issued afterwards, it would have been expected that the various Governments represented there would have intimated to each other, in some degree of confidence, the likely road they would follow in such circumstances. Perhaps we could have an answer to that question first.

Given those circumstances, may I ask another question? The Taoiseach indicated some time ago that in relation to a letter signed by a number of the applicant countries for membership of the European Union, he would have signed that letter if he had been aware of it at the time. Is that still his position and that of the Government? If presented with that letter now, would the Government still be prepared to sign the letter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	430	There appears to be a predilection in this Parliament to ask hypothetical questions rather than practical ones. The Taoiseach and I have stated that there is no problem in relation to the sentiments expressed in the letters concerned, which referred to the primacy of the United Nations, and the need to resolve this matter peacefully. The business before the House relates to the meeting of the European Union Council last night. If Deputies have questions on that, they should put them. If there are some other questions, I will take them also.In response to Deputy Durkan, the position of the Government is quite clear. It has been systematically misrepresented, for their own political purposes, by some elements of the Opposition. Just as I have to accept the sincerity of Deputies on the other side of the House, perhaps they will reciprocate occasionally, given that we all recognise the seriousness of the present situation. I thank Deputy Kenny for his recognition that there are no warmongers in this House. We are trying to solve this problem peacefully in a very difficult situation.Ireland's position has been as clear as we can put it. We want this matter resolved peacefully  and we recognise that primary responsibility for its resolution lies with the Security Council. We were represented when the resolution was formulated, devised and adopted unanimously. At the time, there was a great deal of pessimism as to whether that could be achieved. We would like to think we played a small part in ensuring that it was achieved. We stood for the principle in that resolution that the question of whether there is further material breach is a matter for the Security Council to decide, not for any one state or group of states. We stood for that principle and it is reflected in the resolution.We stood for the principle that whatever further serious consequences were to follow should take place within the UN framework. Since the adoption of that resolution, even if Deputy Sargent does not accept this, the objective evidence confirms that the Irish Government has reflected and upheld, perhaps more accurately than many others, precisely what the UN position is in this regard. Deputy Sargent has stopped quoting the UN Secretary General – perhaps it no longer suits him to do so. I assure Deputy Durkan that the Government has consistently upheld the UN position in this matter.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I wish to ask a few simple, direct and positive questions. Do I understand correctly from the Taoiseach's speech that he is unequivocally of the view that a pre-emptive strike would be illegal, in breach of the UN Charter and, therefore, that it would be illegal to assist any such strike? I have two other questions to follow.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	432	As I stated last week in reply to the Deputy, pre-emptive action is outlawed under the UN Charter, except in two circumstances outlined therein, self-defence or a Security Council decision to take military action in circumstances outlined in the relevant enforcement provisions. The problem in relation to unilateral action, as it has been described, or, more accurately, pre-emptive action, is that if the USA were to act without a further UN resolution, it would claim it was doing so under the already existing 17 resolutions in relation to this matter. The difficulty is that there is no common legal view on this point.When asked what our position would be in those circumstances, we are saying clearly that we wish to avoid the need for military action in the first instance – should military action become unavoidable, we would wish to have it endorsed by a further UN resolution and we do not wish to have military action take place without such further resolution. Our position in relation to such action being taken, as I have outlined, would depend on the circumstances. I do not believe it is in our interests to provide for a definitive position in relation to a hypothetical circumstance. What if that circumstance does not materialise? What is the logic of accepting the inevitability of war and proceeding on the basis that unilateral action is the only outcome to all the efforts being  made? I do not accept that. The EU Council stated last night, with one voice, that war is not inevitable.That was also confirmed by the UN Secretary General last night. He advocated making sure to place the responsibility where it lies for the resolution of this problem and that the European Union should confirm that the Iraqi regime has it in its own hands to resolve this problem peacefully and immediately. UN Resolution 1441 is predicated – and, in response to Deputy Rabbitte's question, a successful outcome of the inspection regime is predicated, as confirmed by Dr. Blix among others – on the full co-operation of the Iraqi regime with the weapons inspectors. If there is full, unequivocal co-operation, this matter will be resolved peacefully. Let us take that responsibility.Yesterday, we asked our EU partners in the UN Security Council to discuss with their partners, including the US and other members of the Security Council, a means by which we can ensure this can be resolved peacefully. Amid all the pessimism of those who advocate multilateral action and those who, apparently, are saying they know the hour, date and time of the war, would they not be better exercised in providing for an effective multilateral response to those whom they claim have already predetermined a unilateral outcome? That is the challenge to the multilateral system at this time, in my view.I intend to work within the European Union and as a member of the United Nations to establish if it is possible for the Security Council to meet its collective responsibility in this matter in a way that will ensure the full and successful implementation of this resolution by peaceful means rather than military action. That is my intention. Those critics, some within this House, who seem to know the date and time of the war, continue to carp about the prospect of unilateral action. We must find an effective multilateral response to those who claim all this is predetermined. That is the challenge for the international community and that is where the Government stands.

I asked the question because it is the distinctive character of President Bush's foreign policy, announced as far back as 1997. My question was simple. I can put it differently, although I do not want to provoke a longer answer. I am sure Kofi Annan would agree too that the threat of pre-emption is probably the single greatest threat to the charter and practice of the United Nations. That being the case, will the Minister saw whether he found evidence, in such conversations as the Taoiseach had with the British Prime Minister, that Mr. Blair was inclined to move back from accepting the doctrine of pre-emption, which, with respect, is not a matter of legal doubt? There is a legal doubt about the interpretation of some of the legacy of resolutions, but not about the concept of pre-emption.The straightforward question about it is this. Is the Minister not concerned about what circumstances and what form of compliance would roll back the military machine? I am not saying this as a pessimist. Where in Resolution 1441 did the Minister find text that suggested that there should be a military build-up of such scale to ensure compliance with the UN resolution?The Minister and the Taoiseach are giving different signals on the question of a second Security Council resolution. I notice in the Taoiseach's speech – it is a very good point which has already been adverted to – that the reference is to the United Nations. The United Nations Charter is really what we all are speaking about. We are as committed to the charter as even a bullied Kofi Annan might be. The Minister knows there have been such circumstances in the past. In reply to a question about a resolution, I recall Kofi Annan, for whom I have total respect, describing participation in one decision in which he said, "I was not part of the loop."  What matters is the charter, not the UN loop.What we really wanted the Minister and the Taoiseach to say – I do not understand why they will not say it – is that they do not accept the principle of pre-emption like other countries, that they are totally against unilateral action and that they have committed themselves to a set of active principles in developing diplomatic alternatives. I accept that he will try it to the end, but can he not say that? Why can he not agree that the charter would be damaged by any pre-emptive action and then accept the consequences by not facilitating it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Let us be clear. The doctrine of pre-emption, the idea that military force will be taken in the absence of any formal consideration by the Security Council, is not something to which I subscribe. It is not part of the UN Charter and I have stated that clearly.On the question of what is determined by people here as unilateral action in relation to these resolutions, I have pointed out – Deputy Higgins, probably alone, accepts this – that there is not an international legal consensus on that matter because if the UK and the US were to act under this resolution, they would claim they already have that clearance under the resolutions.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Let us make this point clear. The Deputy asks what is the Government's position. Our position is equally clear and I have stated it time and again. We want to see a second resolution, regardless of the legal argument, because we believe it will enhance the political legitimacy of such action were we to have a second resolution and maintain the resolve of the international community in facing down this tyrant  who is continuing to defy the United Nations. This brings us to the next question.For those who are trying to claim we are sitting on fences, we are being as clear as we can possibly be in this matter. When people ask me why I will not answer a hypothetical question, my answer is that I will not because no responsible Government here to defend our interest will answer a hypothetical question. I will answer every question on the evolving situation as it demands. In the event, with or without UN sanction for military action, we will come to this House, we will outline the position of the Government and there will be a debate in this House. There is not a better test or example of democratic accountability than that. I am not prepared, however, in the interests of trying to make sure we have devised effective multilateral responses in what is a very difficult and dangerous situation, to conduct a "what if" lesson in this House or anywhere else. If I get into that line of argument, I am allowing for the inevitability of war. There are people in this House – I do not question their sincerity – who do not want war who themselves have got into the logic that everything is inevitable and nothing can happen, and ask what is my position when all this happens.Other people may have the date of the war, but I do not. As long as I am in this position representing the Government and all its people – I hope Deputy Cowley is still listening – I will seek to do everything I can, consistent with the traditions of successive Governments, to ensure the primacy of the United Nations and to work, however difficult the background against which we are operating, to make sure that the Security Council has the primary responsibility in this matter. It is not for the European Union to put down a time-line. We defended the principles and rights of the membership of the Security Council to decide whether there is a further material breach. That will have to come back to the Security Council. We defended the principle that, in the event of military action having to be taken in those circumstances, it would be a matter for the Security Council. That is what we are trying to defend here. Frankly I am tired of those who consistently misrepresent the position of the Government in this matter.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Let me make the point. I do not question Deputy Higgins's sincerity and I know that he does not question mine, but all of us had better stop playing the games of the schoolyard and realise that in the difficult situation we are in, we have to defend our traditions and principles in a way which will be effective. We want effective multilateral responses to this growing problem.I take the point mentioned by the Secretary General at the UN that if we do not have full co-operation from the Iraqi regime, we are back to the situation where the grim choices have to be  faced, where we have to discharge our responsibilities. Otherwise we put at risk the credibility of the collective security system which we have supported consistently since 1955. None of us wants to get to that position, but let us not let a dictator think that we are not prepared to contemplate that position. Were it the case that this regime were prepared to voluntarily co-operate and submit itself to the authority of the Security Council, as any respectable member of the international community should do given the gravity of this situation, we would not be worrying about the military build-up because it would not be necessary and there would not be the threat of force. These are the requirements of the situation.All our experience confirms and all our evidence suggests that this regime does not move to acknowledge the authority of the United Nations until there is a credible threat of force against it. That is a fact, and I wish it were otherwise. It is a fact of life that we must internalise and recognise as being the means by which we can help to resolve this problem peacefully. It is up to us, and it is recognised in the European Union, in the Council conclusions last night, that that is an unfortunate fact of life which we must face up to. If we do not do that, all the evidence suggests that this gentleman will not respond as he is required to do.I assure this House we will work might and main to seek a resolution of this matter peacefully. I respect and recognise the genuine humanitarian instincts of everybody who walked the streets of Dublin or any other town in Ireland and throughout the world last Saturday because I share their hope that we will get a peaceful solution to this problem. Knowing the character of the person with whom we are dealing and the nature of the regime with which we are confronted, unless we are prepared to let him know that the united resolve of the international community will not be undermined by his consistent defiance of the UN, we will not be serving the UN which we all want to respect and which we hope can win out in this case. That is the position of the Government and I cannot be more clear than that.

Is it the Government's understanding that there would be consequences, given the reports that Mr. Rumsfeld has threatened Germany with such consequences for taking a principled stand? Does the Minister accept that those in charge of American investment decisions are themselves a cross-section of American society, where debate is animated on whether a war in Iraq is a good and just thing? In relation to the concept of the "last resort" referred to in the EU statement, does the Government agree with the view of the Bush administration that this is a matter of weeks and months, or do we have  an open-ended timeframe in which to solve this problem?

The Taoiseach commented that the use of Shannon was a small contribution to the military build-up. Since when has it been Government policy to contribute to this or any build-up to a war? This war has been going on for 12 years because bombings have been carried out in Iraq over that time, resulting in many deaths. Why was this Government policy not put before the Dáil?

President Bush was reported tonight as saying that America does not need a second resolution to launch an attack. Can the Minister be very clear on his view on that? In view of the fact that he seems to be prepared to support a war in Iraq that could cost tens of thousands of lives, what threat, in the Minister's opinion, is posed by the Saddam Hussein dictatorship right now? Weapons inspectors of experience believe that most of his equipment has been destroyed or degraded by now and that he knows that he cannot explode a hand grenade outside his borders without facing possible obliteration. Is it not, therefore, a fiction to continue talking about weapons of mass destruction? Does the Minister believe that the US Government has no interest in securing the oil resources of Iraq for its own economy over the next 50 years? Is he saying that is not at all a factor in this situation?

I assure the Deputy that my advocacy and passion for disarmament is as strong at home as it is abroad.Deputy Joe Higgins asked about oil reserves. This situation has arisen as a result of the order to disarm within 90 days given to the Iraqi regime after the Gulf War ceasefire in 1991. Unfortunately, it did not take that opportunity. Everything that has happened since would have been totally avoidable had that regime submitted to the authority of the UN then. The UN is continuing to seek a peaceful solution to the problem of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The inspec tors are not yet satisfied – serious questions remain unanswered to this day. If these questions were properly answered and full co-operation was provided by Iraq, the real threat of military action and all the uncertainty and dismay being experienced by citizens throughout the world, as well as the poor people of Iraq, could be dissipated overnight. Let us hope that the leader of that regime will for once put his people before his unusual attachment to weapons such as these.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I welcome this Bill. It was promised legislation under the programme for Govern ment published prior to the election and it will be beneficial for Irish fishermen. There are two main aspects to the Bill. In the first instance, it establishes a statutory office of appeals officer. The appeals officer has been in situ in an interim capacity since November 2002. Under the Bill it will be a statutory office for five years and will be independent of the Minister, which I warmly welcome.The appeals officer's function will be to examine current legislation and to review any appeals of sea fishing licences brought by applicants who believe they have not been treated fairly. I have received a number of representations from people in my constituency who were unhappy with the licences they received and, in one instance, with not getting a licence. This office will lead to openness and transparency, which must be good for all sea fishermen. I also welcome the fact that in the case of third party appeals, they will no longer be allowed to sit on the fence. In other words, they must make their appeal when the original licence is granted. They cannot come along after having sat on the fence and make a contribution to the appeals officer. If there is a point with which the applicant is unhappy, he or she can appeal within three months of the appeals officer's decision to the High Court. These provisions are most welcome and long overdue.The second part of the Bill deals at length with the conservation of certain species of fish. Fish is a worthwhile and beneficial food. It is also a cheap food with many health giving properties. Unfortunately, in the recent past, due to technology and bigger boats, the stocks of certain species of fish have diminished rapidly. This is caused by over-fishing and there is a danger that some of the fish species will shortly become extinct. The United Nations established an agreement among member states to conserve certain fish species, particularly those that travel through different seas during their life spans The 14 other EU member states have signed this agreement. It has also been signed by the European Union. Ireland is the only member state that has not signed it. That is another reason to welcome the Bill. It is vital, from the point of view of preserving fish species, that the Government be allowed sign the agreement as quickly as possible.This will help protect the interests of Irish fishermen, particularly sea fishermen. Many of our sea fishermen use relatively small boats and in recent times they have had to go further and further out to sea to reach the fish stocks. The other aspect of the Bill which I welcome are the increased powers given to the fisheries protection officers. Members of the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service and the Air Corps can act as fisheries protection officers. They will be able to stop, board, inspect and, perhaps, confiscate not only Irish sea fishing vessels on the high seas but also those of any state that has signed the agreement. Everybody is aware that the boats of certain states have over-fished stocks in the past but our  officers could not board or inspect them outside our territorial waters. That aspect of the Bill is most welcome.I urge the Minister to ensure that the procedure for granting licences and under which appeals will be made is as open and transparent as possible. The sea fishermen, particularly in Raughley Harbour, Mullaghmore, Rosses Point and towards Enniscrone in my constituency, want this process to be transparent and open and I ask the Minister to ensure that this will be the case. How many licences have been granted to sea fishing boats in the last two years?
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I thank Deputy Devins for sharing his time. I welcome the Bill. I live three miles from Greencastle so I am familiar with the difficult lives fishermen have working out of the Foyle and the Swilly and around the coast. It is also difficult for their spouses who often have to sit at home wondering when the fishermen will return and worrying about the difficult seas they will encounter. Any measure therefore that seeks to ease the process and incorporates supports for fishermen where they believe things are not right with an appeals mechanism is most welcome. The fishing industry is happy with this Bill.The Bill is designed to extend and strengthen the sea fisheries legislation. While its primary purpose is to provide for the establishment of the independent statutory appeals process for licensing of sea fishing boats, I am glad it goes beyond that. The Minister pointed out that this process has been in operation in a non-statutory form since 25 November last year. An independent lawyer, Niall Beirne of the Law Library, has filled this position and it is important that people have recourse to such a person. It is important that somebody is available who is independent and is seen by the organisation to be independent when dealing with members' queries.My query is whether it will be necessary to license our boats. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, with the rest of the Cabinet to work hard to ensure that the marine remains a focus not only of the Irish Government but at European level. A time might come when we will not need an appeals or licensing system. The way things are going at present there might not be any boats going out to fish. The fight must continue in Brussels to ensure we will have boats to license.We worked hard to get a white fish fleet renewal scheme. Of the 32 boats in the scheme, 16 were in Donegal and of that 16, six were in Greencastle. This was an important health and safety issue. In my first year as an Opposition Deputy I regularly tried to impress on the then Minister, former Deputy Barrett, the fact that the age of the fleet was between 35 and 50 years. Progress was made under the last Administration and not only were new boats provided in the fleet but support mechanisms were provided for second-hand boats to be made more modern, better equipped and safer.Now that we have addressed the safety issue and have safer, more efficient and better boats for fishing, many boats in the fleet are not being allowed to fish. That issue is particularly strong in my constituency and it will become more important in other coastal areas. People will begin to take notice of it next year in other parts of the country. I ask the Minister of State to work with the Minister and to look at what was agreed in Johannesburg. Deputy Ryan spoke earlier about conservation. Most fishermen do not disagree with the thrust towards conservation so long as the measures proposed are in the interests of conservation. I say that in the context of this Bill enabling Ireland to give effect to the 1995 United Nations agreement concerning conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks and those vulnerable to over-fishing. There should be a concerted international effort to protect such stocks.In regard to cod stocks, we face a serious situation which needs to be addressed, but it should be called what it is. I do not believe that the most recent decision to close a section of area six is true conservation. We need to invest money in research to examine this carefully because there are parts of area six in which there never was and never will be cod, as well as areas with spawning grounds and juvenile areas. I appeal to the Minister of State to dispatch a research vessel to area six to look at where the spawning grounds and juvenile areas are, put the statistical information together and go back to Europe armed with the results. We must deal with the situation realistically.Fishermen are going out not to catch cod because they cannot put a notice on their nets asking cod not to apply. They know from experience that cod will not be caught in certain areas but they are being penalised with days at sea and smaller mesh sizes when the responsible fishermen know where they should and should not be fishing. This cannot be done by Ireland alone – we cannot expect our fishermen to keep out of closed areas when the rest of the European fleet can fish there. This must be an EU-wide measure which is respected around the coastline. Our fishermen are interested in conservation so we should produce the research and proof to tell fishermen that certain spawning areas or juvenile areas are being closed, thereby putting the onus back on them not to enter them. As fishermen in Greencastle have been saying for years, enough protection is provided by the various detection equipment on vessels so it should be easy to enforce closed-off areas.A wind farm has been proposed in the mouth of the River Foyle where there is a strong wild salmon fishery. This is supposedly protected by the EU and under-exploited by ourselves, yet the wind farm developers extol the virtues of the sanctuary effect that will be created by the wind farms. This means that when the smolts arrive at the wind farm, they will not go any further but  swim around only to be eaten by bigger fish. Salmon are tagged in the river in my area and it has been proven that they come back to within 100 yards of where they were born. If they go past an electro-magnetic field like the wind farm, is there proof it will not distort their ability to find their way back and will the salmon fishery survive? I ask the Minister of State, the Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to rally together to ensure it is clearly made known that we find this unacceptable, that we need more information and that we need to know what the effect will be on our salmon stocks. We have done research and we have plans to develop our salmon fisheries. The locks agency is working hard to ensure we have a fishery.Just before Christmas I stood in the Reelin River with water up to my knees at the salmon spawning location. This should not be allowed to disappear because of 85 30-storey wind turbines that could have been located somewhere else. Furthermore, these are of no ecological or other advantage to the Republic.I do not mind sea-fishery enforcement being strengthened if we have done our best to give the fishermen a level playing field. I ask the Minister of State to look at the situation on Lough Swilly – there is a great deal of activity, including commercial and leisure, but there is no overall plan. There is also some activity on the River Foyle and, in that context, I ask the Minister of State to progress the updating of the Foyle fishery legislation so the activity can take place in a planned and progressive manner. I ask that the Swilly be examined in the same context. There are oyster beds and mussel beds, commercial fishermen and anglers, people involved in the RNLI and the whitefish fleet, yachting, jet-skiing and swimming. These cannot co-exist in a safe manner unless we develop a coherent plan. We should look at what is happening in the likes of Lough Swilly, decide whether it is acceptable and develop an overall plan of how we can work as best we can.The Foyle supports the car ferry, has potential for cruise liners and features various forms of aquaculture. Aquaculture is currently unlicensed because we waited for two Governments to progress the legislation, then because of the Good Friday Agreement it was left to the Northern Executive to bring this forward. The Executive is not operational at present. I have asked the Secretary of State, Mr. Paul Murphy, to advance the legislation in the absence of the Executive but that is not the best way to advance legislation – the best way is through people working locally. At least when the Executive was working, one could have a discussion with the Minister – in this case, Bríd Rogers – about the solutions. This cannot continue indefinitely. If the legislation can be expedited by the Secretary of State it should be.Fishermen have a difficult life. I would like to see our fishing industry expand but we have problems because of decisions taken before Christmas  on the sea and land. I ask that the Minister of State works with his senior colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Couglan, and the Taoiseach to examine the on-shore effects of these decisions. The Minister has been good in facilitating interested parties to put their case and they have had meetings with numerous other Ministers. However, their issues are only an example of what the rest of the country might face in years to come unless these problems are addressed now. We must believe we can provide solutions to many of the problems we will have in the future. That will come down to research and to being able to progress on the basis of facts and statistics.Fishermen, statisticians and legislators should work together and the European Union should work with us. It is not in the best interests of anyone that some people would try to conserve stocks while others would do what is best politically for themselves, which is what I consider is the current position.Many good points were made in Johannesburg about conservation and sustainable development up to 2015 and beyond. However, when it comes to working together in Brussels to a deadline, which is usually around Christmas, people consider what they need themselves and real conservation is not taken into account. It is a case of every one for himself or herself, and that is wrong. People should consider the bigger picture. The Common Fisheries Policy needs to be properly reviewed to take account of conservation because we want fishing for life, not only for the next five to ten years.

Tá sé tábhachtach chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le iarthar na hÉireann agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an gcondae arb as mé féin agus Deputy Keaveney.I am delighted to speak on this Bill, which provides for the introduction of two major measures. It provides for the establishment of an independent appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing and a conservation measure or giving effect to the 1982 UN agreement concerning the preservation of fish populations. Both measures are long overdue. It is a great disservice to our fishing industry, a great natural resource we have had for many generations, that these measures were not introduced before now.I am particularly delighted that at long last transparency, fairness and a sense of matters being above board has been introduced in approving and granting licences for fishing boats. I have been a member of this House for 20 years and I am aware of a scandal that has been going on for that period and for 20 years before that.  When honest members of coastal communities applied for licences for small fishing boats, it is scandalous that their securing a licence was pot luck in that sometimes their applications were approved and sometimes they were not, in which case they were not given an adequate explanation as to why they were unsuccessful.I know of many people who had to emigrate from coastal communities, such as the one in which I live, simply because they did not have the connections to get the required fishing licence that would allow them to earn a livelihood. I am sure the Minister of State and Deputy O'Donovan are aware that fishing licences are a valuable commodity on the open market. The way fishing licences were granted in the past was scandalous. I welcome the establishment of the appeals process, which will result in procedures being above board.I am old enough to remember a time when if one was unsuccessful in securing planning permission from the local authority, one contacted the Minister who had the power, the authority and the gall to grant or refuse such planning permission. When one observes the planning permissions that were granted in some parts of the country, it makes one wonder. An Bord Pleanála was then established. I do not agree 100% with all its decisions, but at least I do not believe that all its decisions are politically motivated, which is good.Prior to the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I recall the Minister for Justice of the day had a major say in prosecutions, in which, as Deputy O'Donovan who is a legal person would know, solicitors, barristers and senior counsel got the briefs. We have departed from that, thank God. This is the last bastion of political patronage. It is about time it was ended and for that reason I welcome this measure.In the negotiations last December, with which I will deal later, when a great deal was sold out and many restrictions introduced, a concession was given to the Minister in Brussels that all fishing craft under 12 metres would be given a licence and a quota. I understand that is the position and that application forms in this respect are being issued to members of fishing communities. When the owners of these small craft were obliged to register their craft, we thought it was ridiculous that small boats – 20 to 30 foot boats – had to be registered. It was all right to register them, but the cost of doing so was astronomical. There is sometimes no point in registering in that one will not get a licence unless one has tonnage, and the cost is €4,000 to €5,000 per tonne. Since this regulation was implemented, people in my constituency and other coastal communities last year and the year before thought they had better comply  with the law and abide by the regulations, and they borrowed £30,000 to £50,000 to register a small craft. I could name those involved.I contacted the Department only last week on behalf of a poor fisherman in my constituency. He has a small boat and it cost him €50,000 to get the required tonnage in order that he could earn a livelihood. If that man had decided to hold out until after the negotiations in Brussels last December, he would be entitled to get that tonnage free gratis today. Being the law abiding man he is – there are many more like him – he decided to make the investment. Will that man be refunded his €50,000 investment, given that those who did not invest in the required tonnage will now get it free gratis? It will be unfair if my constituent and others who bought tonnage do not get a refund on their investment. I welcome the establishment of the independent appeals process.The other measure introduced in the Bill relates to conservation. We all know that fish is a renewal asset and is one of our most valuable natural resources. Coming from a fishing community, I believe that fishermen are more concerned and aware of the needs of conservation and preservation than many others, including some of those who write the rules and regulations in Brussels. They know that their livelihoods and those of their children and future generations depend on adequate fish stocks. We must allow fish species to spawn. Fishermen are adherents to, supporters of and firm believers in conservation.The conclusions of the EU fisheries meeting at the end of last year were a major disappointment. They have been potentially devastating for small fishing communities along our western seaboard, from Donegal to Kerry. This measure is being introduced in the interests of conservation but as Deputy Keaveney said, it is a blunt instrument to address this necessary requirement. Fishermen in the north-west who have been fishing for generations will now be restricted to nine days fishing per month in the interests of conservation. In what other profession or walk of life could one survive on the equivalent of nine days fishing per month? This measure is crazy. I do not know how the Minister accepted this terrible restriction. I agree with Deputy Keaveney that our scientists and fishermen should be allowed to carry out their own measures of conservation. This conservation measure is a blunt instrument. There is consternation about this throughout Donegal. For the first time ever the entire fishing organisation in the county went to the Council last week and put its case on record.

I have ten minutes. In April 2001, I moved a neutrality Bill in the Dáil, and I pledged that when we had sufficient strength in the House we would progress it to Second Stage. I am glad to do so now, and the very strength in numbers of those progressive parties and Independent Deputies here today who support Irish neutrality is itself a testament to the growing demand of the Irish people for truly independent Irish foreign policy.The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2003 could not be more timely. Last weekend witnessed the largest political demonstrations in Ireland and around the world in our lifetimes. None of us will ever forget the sight of 100,000 people transforming the streets of our capital city and demanding that the Irish Government oppose the threatened US-British war on Iraq. These were not people marching for material gain or sectoral interests. This was a demonstration of selflessness and idealism and a declaration that the policy and actions of the Irish Government should be, in the words of Article 29.1 of the Constitution, "founded on international justice and morality".This Government has strayed very far from the principles set out in Article 29. Throughout its two terms of office since 1997, it has steadily eroded Irish neutrality and independent foreign policy. This was done by joining NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace without the referendum promised by the Taoiseach, by signing the treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and, most recently and most shamefully, by the Government's conduct in the current international crisis. Irish neutrality is in tatters after the Government's mishandling of international affairs and this Bill is designed to re-establish our neutrality on a solid foundation.In an effort to mollify public opinion when it entered NATO's PFP in 1999, the Department of Foreign Affairs issued an explanatory guide which makes interesting reading today. It stated that Ireland had never been "morally indifferent  to the major international and security challenges of the day". Yet what can we call the attitude of this Government now but "morally indifferent"? There is no basis of principle for its policy and it acts not only as if it were already a member of NATO but a member of the US-British faction of that now divided camp.The Department of Foreign Affairs has stated: "Irish military neutrality is a policy to which this Government is deeply attached. It is a policy espoused by successive Irish Governments and its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances."  Very well, then. If that is the case, let the Minister of State's Government support and, indeed, adopt this Bill. I would be happy to hand it to him.I turn now to the Bill's provisions. Article 28 of the Constitution currently reads: "War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann."  We seek to amend Article 28 to read: "War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war or other armed conflict, nor aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for war or other armed conflict, or conduct of war or other armed conflict, save with the assent of Dáil Éireann."  It has been argued that the Government is already in breach of Article 28 as it stands by facilitating US troops and military material at Shannon. The Hague Convention in Chapter 1 on the rights and duties of neutral powers, Article 5, states that a neutral power must not allow belligerents to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across its territory. The Government is in clear breach of the Hague Convention. It may claim that war has not commenced, but the US and Britain are already carrying out bombing raids on Iraq. If a full-scale attack commences and the Government continues to allow the use of Shannon, it will definitely be in breach of the Hague Convention.It is felt necessary to include the words "or other armed conflict" because the definition of war in international law may be too narrow. I cite the example of Vietnam, where the US was never technically at war with the north Vietnamese. This matter has been considered by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution in discussions on its draft report on Government, which is covered by Article 28. It has been proposed that the words "other armed conflict" be added to 28.3.1º.Our proposed amendment seeks to put the responsibility of Government beyond doubt. It would prevent a Government acting as this one has done without a vote of the Dáil. The kind of underhand and dishonest approach we have seen would be precluded because the Government would be accountable to this House. Taken together with our proposed amendment to Article 29, the new Article 28.1 would ensure that Governments in future adhere to neutrality in policy and in practice.Article 29.1 of the Constitution reads: "Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and  friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality."  Article 29.2 reads: "Ireland affirms its adherence to the principles of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination."  We seek to insert a new Article 29.3 as follows: "Ireland affirms that it is a neutral State. To this end the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances."  This is the key provision of the Bill and would write neutrality into the Constitution for the first time. It is straightforward, as constitutional provisions should be. It is also in line with what the Government claims is its policy – non-membership of military alliances.It is interesting that while the Government claims to follow a policy of non-membership of military alliances, it does not set out the case for non-membership. Why does it not join NATO? It is not sufficient simply to say that it will not join. It must give reasons, or else its failure to do so will be interpreted as preparation for eventual entry. NATO is a nuclear-armed military alliance of the wealthiest states in the world which are using economic and military might to maintain their dominance on this planet. It is an engine of injustice which produces poverty and inequality on a vast scale as military budgets devour the resources that should be used for a war on poverty and hunger. The military budget of the United States now stands at almost $400 billion dollars and Britain's is currently $38 billion dollars.The end of the Cold War should also have marked the end of NATO and a renewal of the United Nations in its role of providing collective security. Instead, we have seen the authority of the UN further eroded as the dominant powers on the Security Council assert their privileged position, and never more so than in the present crisis. Ireland should lead the way in working for a reformed and strengthened United Nations. That would be positive neutrality and independent foreign policy in action. Some argue that what is needed is common defence among the EU states to counterbalance the US, and successive EU treaties have been bringing us in that direction. The last thing we need, however, is more military alliances and power blocs, and that is what the EU is sadly becoming.This Bill provides a foundation stone for what could be a new Irish approach to international relations. So how do we build the new structure? We propose that neutrality should be written into the Constitution as provided for in this Bill. We should implement it with Government policy and legislation. The legislation would, for example, prevent the transport of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons through our territory and airspace and allow for inspection of aircraft and ships. We should withdraw from NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace and from the EU's Rapid Reaction Force. We should campaign for a reformed and strengthened United Nations as the real guarantor of collective security. The UN  should be the site of our engagement on international security and peacekeeping.Ba mhaith liom an Bille seo a mholadh don Dáil agus iarraim ar gach Teachta tacú leis.

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	474	This amendment to the Constitution we put before the House tonight will allow us to stop – indeed reverse – the trend towards the elimination of Irish neutrality. The concept of establishing a free, independent militarily neutral state long predates the Second World War and is deeply ingrained in Irish history, particularly, I am proud to say, in the republican socialist tradition. The father of Irish Republicanism, Wolfe Tone, called for Irish neutrality in the face of an impending war between Britain and Spain in the 1790s. The commitment to Irish neutrality and independence was maintained in the 19th century by the Young Irelanders and was built on by the Irish Republican Brotherhood.Arthur Griffith, who went on to found Sinn Féin, co-founded the Irish Neutrality Association to make the case that the war between Britain and the Boers should not involve the use of Irish soldiers as cannon fodder. James Connolly argued against involvement in the First World War and did everything he could to keep Irish people out of it. The maxim of the Irish Citizen Army, "We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland" summed up the feeling at the time. In August 1916 Roger Casement spoke of "These artificial and unnatural wars, prompted by greed of power, are the source of all misery now destroying mankind."Neutrality continued after the war. It is only by looking back over the years that we can see how clearly our neutrality has deteriorated. Our neutrality has been taken away, not as a result of any one decision or following public debate, but bit by bit until we reached the stage where we were told by politicians and so-called intellectuals that our neutrality no longer makes sense. Politicians have stolen Irish neutrality from the people. Successive Governments have sold Irish neutrality piece by piece against the wishes of the people.More than 100,000 men and women marched past Leinster House last Saturday and I congratulate everyone who took an active part in that demonstration and the organisers for making the day such a success. Was the Taoiseach listening? Were those others, who have long claimed our neutrality was an anachronism, watching the television reports that night? Men and women who have never taken part in a protest in their lives flocked to Dublin in the hope that the Government would finally listen to the people on neutrality. They know we are assisting in a war which can have nothing but disastrous consequences for the Iraqi people and others living in the region. The World Health Organisation has estimated there may be as many as 500,000 casualties. The Government tells us that playing our part in the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people does not, and will not, affect Irish neutrality. The Government is, not for the first time, lying to the Irish people.As if part-paying for America's build-up to war was not bad enough, we now have the surreal situation where Irish troops, whose first responsibility is supposed to be to protect the Irish people from foreign threats, are being deployed to protect foreign troops against the Irish people, more than 100,000 of whom marched in Dublin and Belfast last Saturday.Oil is fuelling the drive to war on Iraq. It is a war of aggression and domination. It is in the purest sense what Jacques Delors referred to in 1991 as a 'resource war'. I ask Members on all sides of the House who are concerned about this matter to speak out on it. I know there are Members who would have gone on the March on Saturday if they were allowed. They have a responsibility to speak out and they will have an opportunity to do so tomorrow and to vote to accept this Bill.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	475	It is obvious that things have changed since 11 September 2001. I welcome this debate because our neutrality has been taken for granted. In eight days last month 19 aircraft carrying weapons or munitions of war sought, and were granted, permission to land at Shannon Airport. In all of last year only 30 aircraft were given permission to carry weapons or munitions. It is known that 532 other military aircraft, mainly American, used Shannon Airport last year. I am concerned about this support in the build-up to war and the assistance offered by refuelling facilities at Shannon. Turning a blind eye to the transport of weapons and munitions is at odds with Ireland's neutrality. Is Ireland really neutral?The people should have an opportunity to vote on this issue. Ireland is supposed to be neutral, yet all this is happening at Shannon Airport. We have had no say on this matter. Those at the peace camp are there because they believe this interferes with our neutrality. While I do not condone damaging an aeroplane, these people feel strongly opposed to the build-up to war. I know we have responsibilities arising from our membership of the international community but  people feel we have gone further than we should. As elected representatives of the people, Members should have had a say in this matter but we have not had that.The Hague Convention grounds our neutrality and neutrality is underlined in the Constitution. What is happening at Shannon demonstrates our neutrality is not straightforward. It is time for us to look at the issue of Irish neutrality. I hope that in the future Ireland will be known as a country that abhors war and does nothing to help in the build-up to it. I am not anti-American. The people who marched in Dublin at the weekend felt that what is happening at Shannon is wrong and wanted the Government to listen to them. Perhaps this debate will initiate a process that ensures our neutrality is maintained.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I welcome the Bill as an announcement of the will of the people to enshrine the policy of military neutrality in our Constitution as evidenced by the massive display of their distaste for war in the march in Dublin on Saturday, conservatively estimated to have been attended by 100,000 people.During the Nice referendum campaign, speakers on the Government side went to extraordinary lengths to reassure us that our traditional neutrality was not at risk and that we were voting to copperfasten it. We now know how hollow that declaration was, given the continuous and surreptitious collusion by the Government in the massive United States war build-up in the past four months. It permitted the unfettered use of Shannon Airport by US airforce planes which continued to carry armed military personnel and munitions until the force of public opinion caused it to use long-established application procedures.One of the earliest known advocates of the neutrality policy was a President of the USA. He signed a neutrality declaration stating that the USA would sincerely and with good faith adopt and pursue a strict code of conduct of being friendly and impartial towards belligerent powers. He cautioned all US citizens to avoid acts which contravened such a disposition and to observe their conduct towards the belligerent powers respectfully. He stated that penalties, punishment or forfeiture would follow breaches of his declaration and that such breaches included aiding and abetting hostilities or carrying contraband between the belligerent powers. The US President in question was no bible-thumping, hell-raising, draft-dodging oil man from Texas but was none other than General George Washington whose motives were the purest.President Washington was so punch drunk from the American War of Independence that he resolved that armed conflict would be a thing of the past. He issued his neutrality declaration in 1793 when France was at war with the combined forces of Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Were his decree to be in force in Ireland, it would result in the Taoiseach appearing in the dock accompanied by  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence, the Ministers of State at their Departments and a number of close advisers. No doubt the appropriate penalties would apply for aiding and abetting the belligerent power. Would that George Washington were around today to restore a modicum of sanity to a situation that could culminate in Armageddon, such is the massive build-up of US military might.Our duty as a neutral nation is to refrain from participation in a war between other states and to maintain an impartial attitude towards the belligerents. Under international law, neutrality is not to be confused with non-alignment. When hostilities commence, a non-belligerent state issues a proclamation of neutrality. It is then the duty of the neutral nation to observe strict impartiality in its relations with the warring nations. That is not to say that neutrality can be switched on or off like an electric light bulb. One looks at Switzerland as an example of a perpetually neutral state.At the Second Hague Conference on Neutrality in 1907, neutral rights and obligations were defined in two conventions. The general neutrality convention, after declaring neutral territory inviolable, laid down regulations for neutral states and listed acts that should not be regarded as favouring one of the belligerents. The second, fuller convention elaborated on the duties of neutrals in naval war. It is ironic that the United States, which was not a member of the League of Nations, asserted its intentions to remain aloof from all wars. In 1935, the US adopted the Neutrality Act.I favour presenting to the mature judgment of the people the option of inserting neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann to enshrine in it the principle of non-partisanship and impartial mediation in military conflicts.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I welcome this discussion. I will vote for the Bill because I agree with the spirit of it, although in the case of the Socialist Party, I would require much stiffer tests than the assent of Dáil Éireann as to what might constitute a war that could be supported.It is outrageous that the Government facilitates the build-up to a war on Iraq by assisting the United States war machine in Shannon Airport in conflict with the stated views of the people. We cannot, even in the case of the imminent war in Iraq, trust the majority in Dáil Éireann, held by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I have no doubt that they would vote in favour of the United States launching a war on Iraq, especially if the United Nations Security Council gave it a rubber stamp, but even perhaps without it. The Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Parties are ideologically aligned with the United States economic system and, therefore, the administrations that dominate it.In the wake of the historic mobilisation of the people and similar protests worldwide on Saturday, strenuous efforts have been made by the  main Government party to cover its tracks in the blatant violation of any concept of neutrality that a person could understand. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, was sent out a few days ago to go on radio to respond to the situation. He cooed like a turtle dove.

We cannot trust the majority comprising the two Government parties.We have had the spectacle of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government making up the rules as it went along in the past six to seven months, or, more correctly, flagrantly flouting and breaking them with abandon as it allowed aeroplanes with armed US military personnel on board to go through Shannon Airport in contravention of the applicable regulations and countless other aeroplanes to go through with unknown cargoes, unknown because the Government did not send in a single inspector to see whether regulations were being breached. The policy of the Government is to actively facilitate the United States war machine in its build-up for an attack on Iraq. I hope we will hear a great deal more in the next few days about the issue revealed today of the overflights, for which the Government is paying the costs, and that taxpayers make their anger clearly known regarding that.The Government employs all types of double standards in the present crisis, parrots the United States line and does not take an independent position, covers over the glaring anomalies in the situation, places the disarmament of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship as the priority because of his allegedly having weapons of mass destruction, turns a blind eye to the more heavily and dangerously armed Israeli state which routinely goes outside its borders to crush innocent people striving for their independence and so on.Mar fhocal críoch, fáiltím go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo againn.

This has led to increasing opposition to the war, which culminated last Saturday in the biggest peace demonstration this country has ever seen. The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government has managed in its own peculiar way to put a spin on this march. The Minister for State, Deputy Kitt, told us the march was in line with Government policy. Yesterday and again today the Taoiseach informed us that the march was for peace, he was for peace and the Government was for peace, therefore those on the march and the Government were all singing from the same hymn sheet.

Why therefore were Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats not officially represented at the march? I do not want to be too hard on the Taoiseach because I know he has difficulties sometimes telling the difference between fact and fiction. I did not get the impression that those on the march were supportive of the Government. Several speakers last Saturday demanded that the Government get off the fence. They demanded an end to the fudge and called on the Government to stop assisting the US war effort by offering the facilities at Shannon.The 100,000 people who marched wanted Ireland to act like a neutral country. They know now, as do the many people who did not attend the march, that the promises made at the time of the Nice treaty referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution were entirely bogus. The Seville declaration meant nothing. The constitutional amendment proposed by the Government does not protect Irish neutrality. It leaves the door open for us to join NATO. The Green Party repeated this many times during the campaign and, I am afraid, we have been proved right.Since Christmas, Government rhetoric on neutrality has changed subtly but perceptibly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has emphasised that we are not neutral but militarily neutral. This phrase is unique to this country and is the sort of Irish solution to an Irish problem that has typified Irish foreign policy for decades. To any impartial or objective observer, it means we are not yet members of a military alliance, but everything else goes. Our neutral and unaligned colleagues in the European Union can only look on with a sense of incredulity and a certain sense of bemusement as we bend over backwards to give every assistance to the United States. Austria, Sweden and Finland could not and would not facilitate the American war effort in this way.In recent years these countries have conducted an open and honest debate on membership of NATO. Some of their conservative parties have  even advocated joining NATO. No such debate has taken place here, nor is it likely to. Instead we will become part of a military alliance by stealth. We do not require a referendum to join NATO. This Bill will close this loophole. Neutrality is not defined in the Constitution or in law. The lack of definition has given the Government considerable latitude and allows it to conduct foreign policy in a way that seems entirely incompatible with any notion of neutrality.How does our present stance comply, for instance, with the Hague convention on neutrality, which has been mentioned by certain speakers? Article 2 of that convention states: "Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral power."  However, we see what is going on in Shannon. Article 11 states: "A neutral power which receives on its territory troops belonging to the belligerent armies shall intern them, as far as possible, at a distance from the theatre of war."  I look forward to our troops going to Shannon and arresting the American troops and bringing them to the Curragh. I will not hold my breath, but if we were complying with this convention, this would happen.I ask the Government to stop the pretence and double speak. The Government should let us have clarity and come clean with the people. If it believes neutrality is an outdated concept, it should say so. Although I disagree with it profoundly, that is a view I can respect. The amendments to the Constitution as proposed in the Bill, and in a previous Green Party Bill, give us clarity and by doing so they flush out the secret militarists and warmongers from their burrows. They have been exposed as dissemblers whose duplicity has so annoyed the Irish people. This Bill gives the opportunity for Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats backbenchers to have the courage of their convictions. If any of them truly believe in neutrality, they will support the Bill. Are they happy to go along with the Government, which has done more than any other to dismantle Irish neutrality?It signed up to the Amsterdam treaty and the creation of the European Rapid Reaction Force and the Petersberg Tasks. It signed up to NATO's Partnership for Peace, without the referendum it had promised. It signed up to the Nice treaty and I have no doubt it will sign up to the new constitution with its commitment to a European arms agency and the new solidarity clause. Is it not the case that the Government will not and cannot accept the Bill before us because it has made these commitments in the past and is likely to make commitments in the future?No doubt the Government will vehemently deny this as it always does, but the present crisis has revealed a level of complicity, particularly with the US military, which even the most committed neutralist could not have foreseen. In answer to a parliamentary question on 26 November, the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me  that no arms were being transported through Shannon. Later he was forced to concede that side arms were being carried. His admission only came after airport personnel had witnessed the weapons. The Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 and the Defence Act 1954, section 3(1)(7), were only signed in January, despite the fact that troops and munitions had been going through Shannon for months in the build up for this war. This demonstrates a readiness to flout our laws and our constitutional commitment to the peaceful resolution of international disputes. It is an indication that our foreign policy is being dictated by the White House. It is proof once again – if it were ever required – that we are closer to Boston than Berlin.Our response to Berlin and Paris has been mealy-mouthed. The Taoiseach even went as far as to state that he would have had no difficulty signing a letter by "new Europe", to quote Donald Rumsfeld, in support of the American position. The letter was divisive for Europe. The prime movers were the British who did not even have the courtesy to inform the Greek Presidency.I have been greatly encouraged by the commitment to peace displayed by Germany and, in particular, by its Green Party Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joschka Fischer. I have disagreed with him in the past on some issues, but in relation to the Iraqi crisis, he has been the embodiment of political courage and vision. He is the one statesman who has stood up to the small-minded and bullying Mr. Donald Rumsfeld. Where was neutral Ireland all this time? It was hiding. There was an opportunity for Ireland to be strong, display our neutral credentials and be an advocate for "old Europe", but it did not happen.The split between "new Europe" and "old Europe" is not simply a split between pro or anti-war factions; it is more accurately a split between the NATOists, if I can call them that, and those who advocate an independent European common defence. From the most recent events it is clear that NATO is in the ascendancy despite what is perceived as the recalcitrance of France. More significantly the statement of Mr. Gustav Haglund, chairman of the EU military committee, that NATO and the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, would be merged within a decade shows that a common European defence will be under the auspices of NATO. The cost implications of either option are enormous.There is an onus on those who support greater military spending to state clearly the areas in which they would cut expenditure. The 100,000 people who marched on Saturday are proud to be neutral and do not want money to be spent on weapons which will blow up Iraqi women and children. They are men and women who are committed to a better quality of life for their children and future generations. They are committed to  neutrality and want the House and the Government to be so committed.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I stand by the comments I made about those who marched on Saturday during a radio debate with Deputy Gormley and reiterate that the Government fully shares the wishes of the people to avoid war. This is an important debate and I thank Deputies for tabling this legislation as their first Private Members' Bill.I will now turn to the reasons the Government opposes the legislation. I hope I will receive the same hearing I gave Deputies during this debate which has been very useful so far. Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality, as followed by successive Governments, is fully respected, protected and upheld by the amendment to the Constitution approved by the electorate only last autumn. This confirmed the central and defining characteristic of policy in this area, that is, our non-participation in military alliances. A commitment was made not to enter into a common defence arrangement in the European Union unless the people decide otherwise in a referendum.Ireland's policy of military neutrality, embodied by non-membership of military alliances, remains viable in the post-Cold War environment in which the emerging defence and security challenges have moved away from traditional defence towards crisis management. That does not mean we need to give this policy constitutional backing. Such a step has not been considered since the 1937 Constitution came into effect. This has been for good reason and I see no basis to alter the approach taken in this regard by successive Governments through several decades.Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party are well aware that the State's commitment to keep outside of military alliances has never been more secure. If this was in doubt – I do not believe it was – the position was reinforced by the constitutional amendment passed at the same time as the people approved the Nice treaty last October. I remind the Deputy that Ireland may not join an EU common defence and this will not change unless approved by the people. Why then has the Bill been introduced in this format at this stage? It is a blatant attempt to confuse the public, spread doubt and misinformation and portray the Government as somehow soft on the question of neutrality.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	487	In doing so, it has been conscious of the complexities in the international security environment stemming from the end of the Cold War and of the need to move on from static certainties which no longer hold true. No practical purpose is served by the proposals put forward by Deputy Ó Caoláin other than, as I will seek to explain, that they would see Ireland adopt an inward looking and narrow interpretation of our international responsibilities. This runs contrary to all that is positive in Ireland's outlook and engagement on international issues.Post-independence neutrality originated as an important expression of our sovereignty. Neutrality became practically possible with the return by Britain of the treaty ports in 1938. It is notable, however, that in presenting this to the Dáil, Eamon de Valera emphasised sovereignty rather than neutrality. The history of Europe from 1935 to 1945 showed clearly that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. It is necessary to work actively for international peace and security, taking account of the prevailing circumstances. In advocating to the Dáil in 1946 that Ireland seek membership of the United Nations, for instance, Eamon de Valera emphasised this reality and stated that "small nations have a particular reason for wishing to have security maintained by combined or collective effort".Since then, our commitment to collective security has been traditionally pursued though the United Nations. We regard the United Nations as the centre of this system of collective security. We attach particular importance to the role of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. In carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the council is acting on behalf of the entire membership of the United Nations. This is a clear obligation on all states.Ireland's position in this regard has many points of reference with that of the other European neutral and non-aligned states. Like Ireland, Sweden pursues a policy of non-participation in military alliances and its security policy is described as "non-aligned in peacetime, neutral in war". This makes it possible for Sweden to remain neutral in the event of conflicts in this vicinity. This is entirely an autonomous Swedish policy with no constitutional underpinning.Nor does Finland rely on a constitutional basis for its approach in this area. The Finns describe themselves as non-aligned rather than neutral and maintain that a cornerstone of their security policy is a credible defence capability. Austria's position is somewhat different in that it became a neutralised state in 1955 upon Soviet withdrawal from the country. It was essentially for this reason and at the behest of the Soviet Union that  Austria adopted a constitutional statute proclaiming its neutrality in return for which the withdrawal of Soviet troops was secured. Switzerland's neutrality, on the other hand, is entirely the result of Swiss sovereign decisions. It also has a constitutional base making the country, in effect, a permanent neutral.Ireland is neither a permanent neutral nor a neutralised state, that is, Irish neutrality is not guaranteed by international treaty, nor has it a domestic constitutional or legal basis. Essentially, neutrality is a policy adopted by successive Governments. Its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances. However, there is already a constitutional provision precluding the State from entering an EU common defence without a further referendum.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	489	Successive Governments have also made clear that Ireland is not ideologically neutral, nor was it politically or ideologically neutral between western democracy and Soviet communism during the Cold War. For example, in 1981 the then Fianna Fáil Government, in supporting military neutrality opposed a proposal to follow a sweeping policy of neutrality in international affairs, the effect of which would have been to distance Ireland from European and North American countries.Neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally and that it is also desirable to be a constructive international citizen. Ireland, notably through the UN, and now also through regional organisations such as the European Union, has sought to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and keeping peace.It is reasonable to position our traditional policy of military neutrality in the context of the many changes which have taken place since the policy first evolved. It is possible to identify three such major developments. First, the Good Friday Agreement which provides an agreed framework for reconciling relations on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, which has been approved by the Irish people. Second, the Cold War has ended. The space which exists for neutral states to position themselves between two military power blocks has disappeared. Threats to international peace and security are increasingly random and varied events involving non-state actors such as al-Qaeda. In some instances – Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan spring to mind – the international community failed to intervene effectively at an early stage, resulting in considerable cost in terms of human life and political instability.The third major change is the development of the European Union. The Union has become an increasingly coherent economic, financial and social entity based upon common values. Com mon citizenship has brought an increasing sense of shared identity and solidarity between the peoples of Europe.What is the significance of all these changes? Do they represent a threat to our policy of military neutrality? The short and clear answer is they do not. Rather, they serve to reinforce the fact that our neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. It is not enough, especially in the context of the fundamental challenges to global peace and security the world currently faces.Political neutrality in international affairs has never been part of Ireland's foreign policy tradition. Rather, we need to continue what we have been doing for decades and continue to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and keeping peace. I have found that our position as a militarily neutral nation has given us additional credibility in our promotion of human rights and in promoting the interests of the developing world.This is even more the case with regard to the new threats we all now face. The asymmetric threats posed by international terrorism do not lend themselves to the more clear-cut postures and responses that have so often been adopted in the past. Instead, they require a much more imaginative and creative approach. In the EU context, thought is currently being given as to how the Union should organise itself to respond to the threat from terrorism and from non-state entities. The challenge here is not only a military one. It is a matter of finding an effective means to bring together the various instruments available to the Union, both civilian and military, and harnessing them to respond to new realities. This does not mean a step towards participation in a military alliance. It is simply a common sense reaction to a potential threat that is random and varied.Moreover, our participation in the European security and defence policy is entirely consistent with this country's long record of contributing to UN peacekeeping missions. The challenges raised by the situation in the Balkans brought into sharp relief the outmoded Cold War approaches to security and defence. This was accompanied by a growing realisation that inclusive strategies of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management are a key to ensuring stability and security in Europe. Despite the best efforts of elements in the Deputy's party that would have the electorate believe otherwise, European security and defence policy has been recognised as the next logical step in the evolution of peacekeeping and crisis management operations.Following the failures on the part of the international community during the 1990s and the resulting genocides of Srebrenica and Rwanda, the UN sought to review its operations and the manner in which it approaches such situations. A clear and ongoing outcome has been greater UN  reliance upon the capabilities and resources, both civilian and military, of organisations like the EU. Should Ireland withdraw from involvement in such operations on grounds that the requests are made of us through the EU rather than the UN? We should clearly not do so. Neutrality has never meant that we sit on our hands and tell everybody else what to do. There is no merit in seeking a higher moral ground while at the same time absolving ourselves of responsibility to maintain peace and security in the world. That has never been the policy in Ireland and it should not be part of Ireland's approach.Let us examine, however, some of the implications of putting the proposed 27th amendment into the Constitution. What would it mean in practice? Let us begin with the statement "Ireland is a neutral state."  This immediately begs the question as to what is meant by the word "neutral", and in the context of the Constitution, a degree of precision is required in the context of a document that is subject to judicial interpretation in the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court. A consultation with Chambers Dictionary quickly reveals some of the difficulties involved. The first reference illustrates the problem. A lengthy entry on the word "neutral" begins with the description "indifferent". Does this sum up the position that Ireland would like to adopt in international affairs? Are we indifferent to inequality and injustice in the Third World and elsewhere? Are we indifferent to the threat posed to the world by international terrorism? Were we ideologically indifferent during the Cold War? I hope the answer to these questions is clear. None of the responses to these questions demonstrates where we would wish to see ourselves in the world, yet as a dictionary definition of neutrality, this is a potential interpretation that could be taken and everyone in this House appreciates the importance of interpretations when it comes to legislation.Reading further on, the entry includes references to "of not decided character", "having no decided colour" and "indistinct in sound". Is this the way we would wish to meet the challenges of the 20th century? If we go down the road suggested by Deputy Ó Caoláin, that is the perception and reality of the position with which we might have to cope.The incorporation of a specific reference to neutrality in the Constitution could have a serious impact on the capacity of the Government to deal with foreign policy issues. Do we consider it more desirable to have foreign policy issues settled in the Supreme Court than by the duly elected Government which, under Article 29.4.1º of the Constitution, is charged with the conduct of the external relations of the State? Do we question the trust placed in successive Governments to chart the course of Ireland's international relations to the extent that we believe the discretion in these matters should be circumscribed by the courts? In essence, we would be taking the  highly sensitive area of foreign policy into the purview of the courts. In regard to our obligations under the UN, for instance, how would a constitutional amendment relate to the enforcement provisions of the UN Charter and our obligations under the charter should these be invoked?Our view has consistently been that the use of military force against another state, other than in self-defence, should be authorised by the UN Security Council. It is the entire membership of the United Nations, comprising almost 200 states, that has vested this authority in the council. However, it should not be forgotten that this entails acceptance of the coercive and far-reaching provisions contained in the UN Charter. If a state continues to defy the authority of the UN, there are provisions in the charter where, as a matter of last resort, military action can be authorised by the Security Council. It is with this support that the UN maintains its primacy in terms of international collective security.Moreover, it is in the interests of small states that there is such a collective security concept based on international law. That is what the UN is all about. Indeed, while the common strand linking the four European Union neutral and non-aligned states is non-membership of military alliances, Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria have opted for a proactive approach to solidarity and peace by joining the UN.There is also the question of how a constitutional reference to neutrality, with all its implications of political neutrality, would square with our participation in the EU's common foreign and security policy. In parallel to the military capabilities for humanitarian and crisis management tasks which the EU is developing, the Union is also developing its capabilities for civilian crisis management and for conflict prevention. This presents an opportunity for Ireland to play a constructive role in international efforts for peace and security. If we have learned anything from the horrific events of 11 September, it is the critical importance of co-operating to enhance the prospects for peace and stability. This is a key challenge for all of us and I do not believe the Irish people would wish to shirk their responsibilities in this area. Participation does not entail any mutual defence commitments.The Deputy and others would perhaps also point to the current Iraqi crisis and to the Government's decision to allow the use of facilities at Shannon by the US. The Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined the Government's position on the use of Shannon in a detailed statement to the House on 29 January.Critics of the Government's approach have again sought to create confusion regarding the distinctions between war and provision for enforcement of international peace and stability as set out in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. As the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and other Government representatives have made clear, the UN is not a pacifist organisation. It is disingenuous that  those who point to this fact should be branded as hawks and somehow supportive of war as the only option to resolve the continuing crisis.The Government will continue to use all its influence in favour of a peaceful solution. While Ireland is no longer a member of the Security Council, we will continue our efforts through the UN, the EU and bilateral contacts with the US and others, including the countries of the region. We will draw attention to the risks involved in military action, the loss of life and material destruction, the danger of further destabilising an already volatile region, the deepening misunderstanding between the people of Islam and the rest of the world and the possible negative consequences for the struggle against terrorism.It remains the view of the Government that military action against Iraq must be undertaken only as an absolutely last resort, to be contemplated only when all other means of pressure have been exhausted. If, however, the Iraqi authorities spurn this last opportunity to meet the demands of the international community, the Security Council must, in the words of Kofi Annan, face up to its responsibilities by deciding on whatever is necessary to secure compliance. We have not yet reached that point.Yesterday's meeting of the European Council in Brussels demonstrated the broad range of agreement among our EU partners. This was reflected in the statement adopted at the end of the meeting, which Ireland made a significant contribution to shaping. Ireland's approach to the issue is very much in line with the overwhelming consensus in the Union on the issue. A united approach by the Security Council is most likely to succeed in convincing Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and therefore secure the peaceful resolution to the crisis which we all want to see. Moreover, the European Council took full account of the deep public concerns about the issue. Let me be clear that the Government fully shares the desire to avoid war.We regard the use of force as a matter of last resort as provided for in the UN Charter. War can still be avoided. Already, Resolution 1441 and the credible threat of force which underpins it has resulted in progress through the return of UN inspectors to Iraq after four years. Saddam still has a chance to comply with the demands of the Security Council, and he should do so promptly and unequivocally.It must be made clear to Saddam Hussein and to the Iraqi authorities that there is no room for further prevarication. The option to remove the threat against the ordinary Iraqi people lies with Saddam. The option to have sanctions lifted and the option for peace lies with them.I would like to return to the specific question of neutrality. In the course of this statement I have reaffirmed, on behalf of the Government, our attachment to a policy of military neutrality. That is what we subscribe to and what we will continue to advocate. This does not mean, however, that we need to insert in the Constitution a nebulous  reference to neutrality that will only be the subject of endless misinterpretation and confusion.The Government sees no reason for a constitutional amendment as proposed by the Deputy, but I thank the Deputies for giving those of us on this side of the House the opportunity to outline our position as clearly as possible.

Tá sé tráthúil go bhfuilimid ag déanamh díospóireachta ar neodracht ag an am áirithe seo. Béarfaidh an díospóireacht deis duinn ár seasamh a léiriú ar an ábhar seo ins an Dáil.It is depressing that we debate this motion against the background of a total derogation of the Government's duty regarding Ireland's position on the world stage. In the face of a mass military build-up in the Middle East, 100,000 people marching on the streets of Dublin and everyone glued to their televisions to find out if war has broken out, the Government has said and done absolutely nothing. It has failed to articulate a policy because it has none and it has given the distinct impression that whatever America wants, America will get.We also debate this motion against the background of an attempt by the Independent Deputies to jump on the neutrality bandwagon and portray themselves as the doves who would save Ireland's soul from the horrors of war. Fine Gael's line on neutrality, the possibility of war with Iraq and this Bill is perfectly clear. Our position is that times have changed. Threats have become more dangerous than ever and it is time to move on.Traditionally Ireland has reacted to EU issues involving security rather than staking out a position proactively. Domestic political debate on these issues has rarely got beyond either accusations of betraying Irish neutrality or safeguarding it in an ever more integrated European Union. No attempt has been made to debate the basis of Irish neutrality, perhaps because it has been associated with so many different values. Even as other political taboos have been breached, neutrality has remained the one political issue we dare not discuss.Three years ago, my party published its Beyond  Neutrality document, calling for a full and frank debate on the issue of neutrality and defence. Since then we have had the events of 11 September and we in Europe have seen the Convention on Europe discuss moves towards a united approach to this issue by EU member states. Those were three wasted years, as Fianna Fáil acted as it always has on foreign policy – it waited for things to happen instead of shaping events. As the Taoiseach said, "Let's wait and see."  Whether people favour it, the reality is that European defence co-operation is now up for discussion. The only question is whether Ireland chooses to help shape the nature of that co-operation or just waits for others to design the structure and then faces a take it or leave it decision. It is surely time to stop paying lip service to neutrality and to our military commitments as a member of the EU. We must get real.Fine Gael has always been the party of Europe. We have always believed in Europe as a principle, whether it was popular, and Europe has been good for Ireland. We must now play our part in strengthening the European Union, particularly at this crucial time in world history. Ireland should participate fully in the development of a common EU defence and security policy.At present Ireland is the least defended state in the European Union while we also have massive levels of American investment. Were Dublin, Shannon or anywhere else in Ireland to be the target of aI-Qaeda or any other terrorist organisation we could not hope to defend ourselves and we have no prospect of fighting off an invasion of our airspace from anybody. However, one can be sure the Government and the Deputies on this side of the House who support the motion would be the first to turn to Britain, France and our other European allies, crying "Help"– as it stands, that cry could fall on deaf ears.Ireland's active participation in the development of a common EU defence and security policy gives the House and the Government a say in what Europe does on the world stage. We are all familiar with the concept of the pooling of sovereignty – EMU is the greatest example of this, and the greatest success. Common European defence means Ireland and other non-aligned countries being empowered to call the big guns of European politics to account.The current crisis in Iraq has inevitably led to a great deal of speculation about the future of Europe's defence role and a common defence policy is firmly on the agenda. Yet listening to many contributions here it is as if that has never even been thought of. What would be the outcome of such a policy were it in place today? Germany and France, which have resolutely led the call against war in Iraq, could have called Tony Blair to account for his actions in blindly supporting George W Bush. Britain would have had to meet its European allies and I do not doubt that America's strongest supporter would have pulled back from its unilateral approach.The Irish Government would have played a part in this, though not if it were the same one I face now. The people will have to wait some years more until they have a Government that leads. Fine Gael does not propose the signing of a blank cheque by Ireland – any common defence policy would see Ireland decide on a case by case basis whether we would offer members of our armed forces in a conflict. Of course, if a common defence policy were agreed that did not meet with the approval of the majority of Members of the Dáil and the people, we would not have to become members. However, we have a duty to play a part in forming the best common defence policy that we can. We are all members of the European Union. Our political opponents on both sides may like to portray our position differently but I am stating the facts of the case.Regarding the current military build-up, we have for months outlined the core elements of what should be the Irish approach to this crisis: opposition to unilateral attacks against Iraq; only multilateral action supported by the UN to be considered; prior Dáil approval for Irish refuelling or overflight facilities to be sought if multilateral action is authorised by the UN; independent verification to be sought in relation to American and British reports, as distinct from inspectors' reports, on Iraqi weapon stocks; every proactive step possible to be taken to show that we stand with civilised, democratic states and against demagogues and dictators; Ireland's security and defence needs to be reassessed; the General Affairs and External Relations Council of the EU to be asked to consider what contribution the EU will make to stability and prosperity in Iraq post-Saddam Hussein; that the alarming concerns expressed by UN inspector, Dr. Hans Blix, be raised in relation to unanswered questions concerning the possession by Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; and that Ireland unequivocally condemns the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.In expressing this approach, we stand by the vast majority of Irish people, eager to see war averted but eager too to ensure Saddam Hussein is removed from the Middle East, if not for our sake, for the sake of the Iraqi people.Regarding the Bill, the Green Party has clearly expressed support for neutrality and Fine Gael respects that position. However, when it comes to inserting a clause in the Constitution that would muzzle this House, tie the hands of the Minister and allow Ireland to stand idly by while innocent people suffer at the hands of despots and dictators, Fine Gael says "No". Both within the Dáil and outside, the Green Party and Sinn Féin preyed on the fears of people during last year's Nice referendum, saying a "Yes" vote would mean Irish men and women dying on battlefields. Look at what has happened – the Nice treaty was passed, enlargement has been approved and the dire predictions of the opponents of the treaty have amounted to nothing.This Bill is the next step. It is meaningless and  pointless, yet it tries to serve its main purpose, to portray its sponsors as committed to peace and its opponents as committed to war. Fine Gael cannot and will not allow such an untruth to be put to the Irish people. My party has always believed passionately in this House, the people of Ireland, the European Union and the United Nations. These provide a framework for defence, not short-sighted amendments to the Constitution that are bad in theory and unworkable in practice.Tá lúcháir orm go raibh deis agam cúpla focal a rá ar an Bhille seo agus mo sheasamh féin agus seasamh mo pháirtí a chur ar chlár na Dála.

He might not espouse the same views as me and I assure the House that the sharing of my time is in no way a recognition that I am conceding to him.This is possibly the worst time to have a debate of this nature. If a debate on neutrality is to take place, it should be along the lines suggested by Deputy McGinley, at a time when we can calmly and coolly assess the situation and recognise that we are making a decision for present and future generations. We should not do it against a backdrop of pressure, or the threat of war or violence, but in the clear knowledge that we are meeting the requirements as we see them at a particular time.Deputy Gay Mitchell has done a tremendous amount of work to focus attention on neutrality and its meaning. I heard my colleagues mention Arthur Griffith, one of the founder members of the organisation now known as Fine Gael.

He did not want to see Irish people lose their lives in the Boer War when they would have been better off at home. My granduncle joined the Australian army in 1915 and landed in Gallipoli. He survived Gallipoli but unfortunately died in Ypres. My grandfather, on the other hand, was involved with the Irish Volunteers, a contradiction in terms. All of our history is a contradiction. There are circumstances where we should be able to sit down and calmly assess our situation in the knowledge that what we are doing is for the good of the people and the future of the State and not just to meet requirements as they arise.Deputy Gay Mitchell has set out many times the vulnerability of this country. There are those who are suggesting that this Bill should be written  into the Constitution. What would happen if we were under attack? Who is to say that a neutral country will not be attacked in the future? What happened in the run up to the last war? Were neutral countries not sacrificed on both sides with colossal loss of life? The fact they were neutral had no bearing on the outcome of the situation. The aggressors had no mercy for them because they were neutral – they walked right over them. There are countless examples of this.We should not allow ourselves to end up in a situation like those unfortunate countries. We can say that we are on the periphery of Europe, not in its cockpit, and that we will not be caught in crossfire so readily. That was true in the past but it is not necessarily the case now. With modern technology a neutral country can quickly become a victim of terrorism. What should we do? Should we say that we are neutral and we cannot be touched? If a group hijacked a nuclear missile and dropped it on a neutral country, where would it select? It would not select a country that would strike back. Modern terrorism relies on selecting innocent targets that cannot retaliate. Terrorists believe in the legitimacy of such strikes to illustrate the legitimacy of their cause. That is a serious breach of international convention and we must be mindful of it.What if the man who was going to hijack a plane in Sweden recently had decided to plunge it into the centre of this city? Under legislation arising from the Nice treaty restricting our ability to respond to a greater extent than before, we would have to have a referendum before we could call on other people to assist us in our defence. If we did not do that, we would be in breach of our Constitution.Fine Gael has always advised against writing things into the Constitution. The Minister of State opposite knows why we have done that and knows the wisdom of our advice.

Other Irish people have displayed their valour on battlefields far from their native shores, in places like Landen and Fontenoy, and not necessarily in the  interest of their country but in a military interest. The definition of neutrality as developed around the Second World War is not a true reflection of the meaning of neutrality. We have brought upon ourselves a one size fits all neutrality, where we can be on both sides as the situation demands. Life is not like that and that will never work.We have played a major and formative role in the emerging Europe. The degree to which we are committed to all aspects of European evolution will, in some way, determine the respect Europeans will have for us. If we wish to be like Tadhg an dá thaoibh, they will quickly recognise us as such. We must have some commitment to that European concept, which also means some involvement at some future stage in our responsibilities in relation to defence and security. It is comparable to a person who says: "Will you carry my umbrella as it is raining very heavily?" and the other person replies: "I am very sorry but, while it is raining, I cannot carry your umbrella."  It is not much good to one at any other time. Similarly, we will be expected to carry some responsibility.That has nothing whatsoever to do with the Nice treaty but it will be a requirement at some stage in future. If we decide to opt out on the basis that we are neutral or non-aligned, or stand aloof from defence and security in Europe, we will be vulnerable and open to attack from some quarter. That need not be from a major power. It can be from somebody with a brief case filled with lethal material – it is as simple as that. We had better recognise that situation.Whatever happens in relation to neutrality, we should have a long and open debate on this matter at a time when we are not under pressure, without being press-ganged into any decision to meet a particular situation. We should conduct our business in a cool, calm, unpressurised manner. I believe that is the way to proceed, as Fine Gael has advocated over the past several years through our spokesman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is unavoidably absent tonight due to other parliamentary business. He has very adroitly focused public opinion on this issue.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing time with me and for accommodating a totally different view. I warmly welcome this Bill, which I strongly support. I call on Deputies from all sides of the House, from different parties and groups, to collectively support this Bill. This Bill concerns our country, our foreign policy and putting Ireland forward among the nations of the world as a broker for peace, equality and justice. Above all, this Bill is about taking an international stand on peace and world security. It shows a clear vision for the future and puts down a marker for the rest of the world. It is entirely appropriate to consider such legislation at this time in world history.This debate also provides an opportunity to confront the knockers of Irish neutrality and the  super powers' supporters within this House who have not the courage or honesty to tell the Irish people why they support the foreign policies of countries that dropped bombs on Hiroshima or place bombs in Dublin to force legislation through the Dáil. Phoney, two-faced legislators must be challenged. They got their answer in last Saturday's march in Dublin, with more than 100,000 people demonstrating against war, demanding an end to weapons of mass destruction in all countries and demanding that the present massive waste of public money should be spent, instead, on the starving millions in Africa, Iraq and other countries. Last Saturday's march was not about sitting on the fence. It was about equality and justice.In this debate on the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2003, we should take on those who say that neutrality is sitting on the fence or looking the other way while somebody is being mugged. That angle, which is being presented lately in The Irish Times, is absolute nonsense. It is an insult to those who gave their lives in the course of UN peacekeeping missions and the thousands of Irish people who have risked their lives on Third World projects and famine relief missions. To take a recent example, people like Caoimhe Butterly are certainly not sitting on the fence in the context of peace and justice in Palestine.Those who use the example of someone being mugged totally misrepresent the real situation. Instead of trying to stop the mugging, they appear to want to jump in to support the aggressor. Being neutral means being active in conflict prevention, retaining our independence and going out into the world as peace brokers. The NATO fan club in this country lacks the decency or honesty to admit openly that they wish to end our neutrality and support NATO. They should tell the Irish people where they stand and end their policy of fudge.I will make it clear where I stand on the question of neutrality. It is within the OSCE and a reformed United Nations, not the European Union, that Ireland should pursue its security concerns. Ireland should pursue a positive neutrality and an independent foreign policy, not joining or forming an association with any military alliance such as the Western European Union or NATO. Ireland should seek to promote European and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation. We should, therefore, oppose the militarisation of the EU. Ireland should refuse to co-operate with or condone in any way policies or military groupings which maintain nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction.Many powers in the EU already have weapons of mass destruction. Although there is constant emphasis on breach of UN resolutions by Iraq, another country in that region, Israel, has already breached 68 UN resolutions. In this regard, we need to be honest with the Irish people.Irish troops should only serve abroad as peace keepers under the auspices of the United Nations. That is my position on Irish neutrality. It is not a policy of burying our heads in the sand. It is a positive view which is in the interests of the Irish people and the vast majority of people in the world. That view was represented by those who marched last Saturday.This Bill is the way forward for our country. It is the policy expressed by 100,000 people last Saturday and it is up to all of us to deliver on their wishes. There is massive anger with regard to the use of Shannon Airport as a US military base. This Bill is also about spending on food programmes and health care projects the money now being spent on arms. It sets out to show the world that Ireland wishes to appear on the world stage as a peace broker and a country with a humanitarian vision, working towards a policy of accommodating difference with respect for human rights.That is the type of new Ireland in which I wish to live. That is the type of country which will emerge if we support this progressive Bill. I urge all Members and all parties to unite in support of this Bill and to vote in favour of it, as I will do. It represents a "Yes" for peace, justice and equality and, above all, a vote for a new Ireland, looking to the future and respecting our past. When we speak of the future, we should also recognise those who gave their lives for independence and the right to have a foreign policy. Sadly, I believe that this Government, under whatever influence, is turning its back on the long, historic support for Irish neutrality and a principled stand on foreign policy which can command the respect of Third World countries.In economic terms, this approach is also good for Ireland and its industries. If we open our hearts and go forward as a peace broker in the world, that will bring economic benefits. We should not ignore markets in the Middle East and throughout South America. Many countries do not wish to see Ireland "tipping its cap" to the USA or Britain. I urge all Members to support this progressive, top quality Bill which shows the way forward. It presents the view of young people in the Ireland which is now emerging. We have gone through 30 years of conflict in our own country. We have worked hard to get all sides to the conflict together under the Good Friday Agreement. Paragraph 4 of that Agreement talks about settling conflict peacefully and without the use of force. Therefore, I would urge people, in line with that progressive Agreement, to support the Bill.

#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The closure of Graham & Heslip is a major blow to the town of Ennis and the surrounding area. Graham & Heslip purchased a family run business in Ennis two years ago and now it has gone without as much as a day's notice to the loyal employees it inherited with the takeover of the company. Some of these employees have been in the business for the past 18 years. The company employed a large proportion of local young people, had a highly trained and qualified staff and produced a high quality product.What are these employees to do? They have been left without their pay, their P45s, their holiday entitlements and an alternative employer. They find themselves unemployed after receiving only a few minutes' notice and to add insult to injury, the owners of this company tried to take the machinery and tangible assets from the plant the following day. What type of treatment is that for any employee? Is this to be a precedent for other companies to follow? Is this what the Irish workforce has to put up with, a company coming from only up the road in Belfast to strip them of their assets, take their customer base, their machinery and their business portfolio? Did this company have any intention of making a go of it in Clare? How are companies like this to be made accountable? What happens when it is a company from outside this island? How are employees to know in the worse case scenario, like we now have in Clare, that they will receive their pay and notice of unemployment? What are the safeguards to protect against this happening?Many families, both young and old, have been affected by this closure. To bring it home to the Minister of State, I personally know two young people who, when they left on their honeymoon two weeks ago, had a livelihood and now have to return to unemployment and face the prospects of not being able to pay their mortgage and other everyday bills. Is that what is in store for young couples trying to make their way in this country?This is the third factory closure in Ennis over the past three years. Clare is turning out to be a blackspot for job losses and there is no action from the Government. Following the closure of Tellabs in Shannon, with the loss of 400 jobs, there is little or no industry in west or north Clare.When I was elected to the council 18 years ago, Milltown Malbay was a thriving industrial town. Since then all the industries in this town have closed down. Shannon Development and the Western Development Commission are in charge of encouraging industry to Clare. Not one major factory has been set up in the county within the last ten years.The deepest water in the Shannon Estuary is on the Clare side. Although successive Governments commissioned reports on the development  of the estuary, these are now gathering dust in the Minister's office and now we are led to believe that the present Minister is preparing another report on the estuary. It is about time the Government woke up, listened to the people of Clare and did something positive about job losses.I alerted the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the crisis in Clare in a parliamentary question on Tuesday, 5 November. I asked her to visit Clare. In her reply she stated she would be in the county at the end of that month. She came but did not address the job crisis. She also stated that Shannon Development was developing a 35 acre information age park which will provide a new focus for industrial development in County Clare, and particularly for Ennis. The park will offer a potential investor world class accommodation and infrastructure. This is a major initiative for Ennis and County Clare and will be a key focus for Shannon Development's promotional activities in the area.I say, live horse and you will get grass. I ask the Minister of State to do whatever is within the law to ensure that these workers get their entitlements. I also ask the Minister to visit Clare and set up a task force to tackle the unemployment situation in the county.I congratulate our neighbours in Roscrea on the announcement of 300 new jobs. I would ask the Minister to follow with a similar announcement for County Clare because at this point we are desperate. There are many people unemployed in Clare who will never work again.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I am delighted to see that three Oireachtas Members from Clare, including Deputy Killeen, are supporting the motion. I am sure he will brief the Minister of State on the closure.As my colleague, Deputy James Breen, stated, the people of Roscrea are celebrating tonight with the excellent news that Taro Pharmaceuticals Limited is to set up as a new major industry to replace the Miza facility which closed recently, and I welcome this good news.This is a far cry from the position of the 42 workers of Graham & Heslip in Ennis who, on Friday, 7 February at 2 p.m., were told that they no longer had jobs with the company and were given 50 minutes to gather their personal belongings and leave the premises.The print company was established in 1984 and many of the workers have given long loyal service over the years. Thermofoil Printing, as it was then known, was taken over some years ago by the present owners, Graham & Heslip, who I understand were given considerable financial assistance by Shannon Development.I visited the premises on Monday morning, 10 February, to speak to the workers and heard today that they still have not received their P45s, P60s or RPIs. This is a disgrace. Every effort must be made by the Minister, Deputy Harney, to deal  with this unacceptable situation, to make sure the employees are given their full statutory redundancies and that the terms of the employment legislation are complied with.Has the Minister made contact with the owners of the company? Has a liquidator been appointed? Has a creditors' meeting been arranged? I understand that the matter was raised in the Upper House last week and at that time no contact had been made with the directors.This is a devastating blow for the town of Ennis. The disgraceful manner in which these workers lost their jobs is another milestone in the industrial decline of Ennis. The number of jobs lost in County Clare over the last two years is well over 600. The alarming statistics of job losses have been backed up by recent live register figures for Ennis. The numbers on the live register have increased by 12% from 1,813 in 2001 to 2,034 in 2002. In October 2000, the figure was 1,448. This means that unemployment figures in Ennis have grown by about 40% in two years, and that does not include the latest redundancy figures. Companies that have shut their doors in Ennis in recent times include Overland Bowling, Studio Eyewear and Pacific Scientific, as well as a number of smaller companies whose closures were never reported on the media because of the small job losses.Last October, I asked the Minister to visit County Clare when the Tellabs facility in Shannon announced its closure with the loss of over 400 jobs. I also asked her to give priority to County Clare for job creation and to establish a task force. Unfortunately at the time she said she had a heavy schedule of official commitments and would not be in a position to visit Clare.The Minister also stated that she was encouraged by job creation in the mid-west. The facts I mentioned earlier do not tally for the town of Ennis, where every day there are young people, many of whom have mortgages, coming into my office with their CVs seeking jobs to replace the ones they have lost. It is most humiliating for them. A jobs task force must be set up to focus on re-engaging the hundreds of workers who have lost their jobs and to attract new inward investments. Deputy James Breen and I have highlighted the serious situation.To add to these difficulties, the Ennis by-pass is not getting the go-ahead in 2003 and, therefore, there will be no jobs for road building workers, Shannon Airport is under constant threat with many services lost in recent weeks – 50 jobs were lost at Cable & Wireless in Shannon two weeks ago. The Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Fahey, has offered to come to Ennis, but this is not good enough. We want the Minister to see for herself the situation in the town named as a hub for job creation in the national spatial strategy programme. A hub for job losses might be a better title because no major industries have come to Ennis in many years, despite the fact that it was the first information town in the country. There is  no prospect of immediate broadband technology. Positive action must be taken by the Government to find jobs for the unfortunate people such as those who lost their jobs at Graham & Heslip last week.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I thank the Deputies for raising these matters on the Adjournment and I also thank Deputy Killeen, who has advised me on the matter. I am indeed aware of the sudden closure of the company in question. The closure came about without prior notice. Shannon Development, the industrial development agency with responsibility for the company in the mid-west region, immediately advised the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.This is a long-established company in Ennis. Originally, it was established as Thermofoil Print Limited in 1984. In early 2001 it was acquired by its present owners when a subsidiary company took a 75% shareholding in the original company while one of the founders of the original company retained the other 25%. It has received considerable financial assistance from Shannon Development over the years. The company designs and produces specialised products for the domestic market. Its main product areas are greeting cards, packaging, annual reports and promotional colour printing. I understand it had a good reputation as a specialist in a range of printing options, including full colour printing, embossing, watermarking and carton manufacture.A substantial number of the employees have been with the company for a number of years. Traditionally, the company has been regarded as being a stable source of employment in Ennis. Shannon Development had a review meeting with the company last summer and at that stage the feedback from the company was very positive. Therefore, the news of the closure is surprising, although it is of course a greater shock to the employees of the company.Shannon Development has been trying to contact the company to discuss what is happening. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has written by registered letter to the company reminding it of its obligations in respect of collective redundancies, minimum notice and statutory redundancy generally as a collective redundancy notification had not been received in respect of the company. However, direct contact has been established with the company by my Department. In correspondence to my Department the company says that the decision to cease trading was only taken after all other avenues had been investigated and exhausted.There are certain provisions in employment legislation which must be complied with. Under the terms of sections 9 and 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, an employer who proposes to undertake collective redundancy is obliged to consult the employees' representatives  and give the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment written notice of his proposals at the earliest opportunity and, in any event, at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes effect. The Act provides for significant penalties in the event of non-compliance by an employer with the relevant provisions. Furthermore, there are provisions whereby employees can refer to a rights commissioner complaints regarding non-compliance with information and consultation provisions. In addition, there are statutory provisions relating to minimum notice and redundancy payments which have to be complied with.I share the concerns expressed here about this most unfortunate situation. Every effort is being made to unravel the problems. The further job losses in the second company in Shannon arise from a corporate restructuring of worldwide business in the company. The job losses will take place over the next nine months, with one third taking place in June, a further one third in September and the final one third in November 2003. I understand local management in the company is currently in negotiation with staff representatives regarding redundancy terms.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this important issue on the Adjournment. There is extreme disappointment in County Cavan at the decision of Teradyne Incorporated to close its manufacturing facility in Cavan town and move its assembly operations to Blanchardstown. It is a great source of disappointment to the 37 permanent employees and 25 temporary employees. The expected closing date of 28 March will be etched on the minds of those employees.In 1997 I enlisted the support of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to try to bring inward investment to County Cavan and I appreciate their efforts and wholehearted commitment to the creation of jobs in the county. In November 2000, the excellent news was confirmed for us that the American company Teradyne Incorporated was to invest €62 million in a major new industrial campus near Cavan town. The development was to create 740 jobs over a five-year period. It was a great achievement to bring Teradyne, a major world leader in interconnection systems manufacture, to Cavan. The announcement represented the first significant IDA Ireland supported investment in the county in more than 22 years. With efficiency, Cavan County Council processed and approved the planning application. An appeal was lodged to An Bord Pleanála and, unfortunately, a delay of almost seven months occurred. However, basically the same decision was made by the board after this time as had been made by the local authority originally.That delay caused considerable problems. At the end of October 2001, we heard the extremely disappointing news that Teradyne had deferred the construction of the industrial campus and was to continue instead its operations in a temporary base in the IDA Ireland advance factory near the  town. Since then, 60 people have been employed at that location, who are now to lose their jobs. In securing this inward investment in the first place, there was a wholehearted, co-operative effort by the executive of Cavan County Council, local public representatives, the IDA Ireland regional manager and staff and the county enterprise board. Indeed, Teradyne has acknowledged that it received at all times the wholehearted co-operation of the statutory agencies in County Cavan and the support of the public at large.County Cavan and the Border region in general suffered immensely as a result of the 30 years of troubles in the northern part of our province of Ulster. Our natural economic hinterland was cut off. We did not get adequate Government investment or inward investment. The decision of Teradyne to locate in Cavan clearly demonstrated that major companies recognised that things had dramatically changed in the Border region and that a centre such as Cavan is now an attractive location for foreign direct investment. The county has a good workforce, a diligent people with a commitment to work. Huge numbers of our people, particularly our young people, who are highly qualified and skilled, are working in the technology industries outside the county. We need modern, knowledge-based industry to attract these people back to the county and to retain the emerging workforce, who are currently attending second or third level colleges.County Cavan has been heavily dependent on local entrepreneurship to meet its employment needs. I compliment those companies which, through the most difficult of times, have provided worthwhile employment opportunities in our county. In more recent times, those companies have traded in a better economic climate. Overseas firms represent 27.7% of all manufacturing and internationally traded financial services employment in the county, compared to a national average of 52%. I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the industrial promotion agencies for a focused and targeted campaign to secure a major new industry for Cavan. The ingredients that made the county attractive for inward investment two years ago are all still in place.The development of the peace process has brought many benefits to the whole island, particularly to our province of Ulster. Over the years, I, with Deputy Crawford and other public representatives, have consistently raised in this House the need for counties such as Cavan and Monaghan to gain a new economic dividend, particularly in the area of job creation. If Departments and State agencies are serious about tackling the imbalance in economic development, areas such as Cavan and Monaghan have to be given priority when it comes to the push that is needed to attract necessary and additional job opportunities.The Minister, the Department and the industrial promotion agencies can promote Cavan's  case easily and credibly. The county has a well educated, computer literate, highly motivated and flexible workforce. Its people share our sentiments that we need those jobs.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The attraction of new foreign direct investment to Ireland is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland. Despite the global economic downturn, the level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world. Ireland today competes with many other countries for new projects and, indeed, the relative attractiveness of one regional location in Ireland to another is often the decider for a company as to where it will locate. This makes the challenge in Cavan even greater.The designation of Cavan town as a hub in the national spatial strategy confers on it a strategic position in the overall development plans for Ireland, acknowledging that it can support development in both the gateways and rural areas which surround it. Cavan town, with Dundalk, Monaghan and Drogheda, is one of the four towns of emphasis in the north-east region for the IDA Ireland and is strongly marketed for new investment. IDA Ireland is currently investing €1 million in Cavan in enhancing the 35 acre business park at Killygarry. This will bring the park up to flagship standard and will greatly enhance its attractiveness for new inward investment. The work is already under way involving the extension of internal roads, services and extensive landscaping. IDA Ireland has also sought and received planning permission for two 2,500 sq. meter advanced technology units from Cavan County Council, which will be constructed on a roll-over basis by the private sector.The announcement on Friday, 14 February 2003 by Teradyne Incorporated that it will close its manufacturing facility in Cavan town presents a challenge to try to secure a replacement industry. When we announced just three years ago that Teradyne was to establish a major facility in the town, it represented the culmination of many years of work by IDA Ireland and others in promoting Cavan for new inward investment. The decision by the company to locate in Cavan highlighted the fact that the smaller regional locations can support significant industry. Nothing since then suggests that there is any need to review this thinking because the Cavan location did not impact on the decision to consolidate the company's operations in Dublin, but rather the general downturn in the worldwide telecommunications industry.Teradyne acknowledges that the decision to close the Cavan operation is in response to a continuing worldwide electronics manufacturing downturn. This initially caused the company to abandon its plans for the major manufacturing facility in Cavan. It now sees consolidation as the  best way of cutting costs and contributing to the viability of its operations in Ireland. In response to the closure of Teradyne, IDA Ireland has already begun an intensive campaign across a broad range of sectors to identify an alternative industry. This involves briefing all its overseas offices on the Cavan facility and appraising them of the skills of the Teradyne workforce. While IDA Ireland is concerned that the current economic downturn, particularly in the telecommunications sector, will increase the difficulty of getting an early positive result, it is determined to work closely with FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the other local stakeholders to minimise the effect of the closure and to find an alternative industry as quickly as possible.Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development of indigenous enterprise, continues to work with companies in County Cavan to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. In terms of job creation, activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through support of entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. Enterprise Ireland is continuing to concentrate on maximising job gains in its client companies.In County Cavan, Enterprise Ireland has focused on building and construction materials as a targeted sector and is endeavouring to build on the existing cluster of companies in the county. Enterprise Ireland is currently working with Foamalite Limited in Lough Gowna, County Cavan, to further develop its sales, exports and innovation. This company, which began in 1998, is an excellent example of a new company in this cluster. In November last, an €88 million investment by Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago based health care company, at its nutritional manufacturing plant Cootehill, County Cavan, was announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. This company's expansion was supported by Enterprise Ireland and will lead to the creation of 100 new jobs over the next three years. Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies with detailed export plans, which are expanding or establishing a business in the county as part of the BMW region. In 2002 funding amounting to €1,205,914 was approved to Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Cavan.The community enterprise programme is also an important part of Enterprise Ireland's support for community based projects. Under the programme, the agency has helped fund the establishment of six enterprise centres in County Cavan since 1989. These are located in Cavan, phases one and two, Kingscourt, Bailieboro, Cootehill and Killeshandra.I am confident the initiatives adopted by IDA  Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with other local organisations, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring positive results to Cavan.

Tonight, I must highlight the difficulties of another group of people who face extreme difficulty, those who depend on home help. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the dire situation in the Southern Health Board region but people in my constituency of Kerry South have been in contact with me about this issue and they are in a dreadful state. The home help service is essential in assisting families who are caring for elderly or ill people. Many families who are trying to keep their lives together while keeping a parent or sibling at home need the home help service. I will not be political about this issue but I appeal to the Minister to use his office to see if anything can be done in the Southern Health Board area for the home help service.An open letter to the Minister for Health and Children was published in The Examiner today. The correspondent, a woman, said her home help service ceased on 13 November last year. The woman has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or chronic multiple sclerosis. Her home help was restored on 9 January. She has a husband and two children and her daughter helps her mother with her bodily functions and everything she needs to do. Her daughter has said she doubts that she will ever have children herself because she could not put anybody else through what her mother is enduring.A family contacted me recently about this matter. Their mother is in the final stages of senile dementia. It is a small family and the members have juggled their lives to keep their mother at home. She had 21 hours of home help but the family received a phone call last week to notify them that this was being reduced by three hours. This might seem small but three hours to this family means they must juggle their lives again, get more hours off work and get their children to mind their mother. I plead with the Minister to ensure that emergency funding is made available for these dire cases so people can keep members of their family at home. If another hour is cut from the home help service for the woman with senile dementia, it will mean she will finish her life in a hospital. The family does not want to put their mother in hospital, they want to keep her at home. The Minister will understand that.I pay tribute to the local staff of the health board. They are genuine people who work at the coalface. They hear people's grievances. The district nurse recommends the hours but the money is not available to provide the service for those  hours. The staff of the health board have to give the bad news. The people giving the bad news are human too and it breaks their hearts to give it. It is unfair of the Minister to put his staff, the patients and their families through such turmoil. The cases I have raised, as well as others, involve people in their final days. I ask that they be given the dignity of staying at home and that their families are assisted in caring for them. I hope I will get a positive response from the Minister of State as to why the Southern Health Board has been instructed to cut home help.

Since 1997, my Department has allocated significant levels of funding to services for older people and across the disability sector, resulting in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health-related services being provided. Additional funding of €27 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to enhance further the services in the sector.This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to €288 million, which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base. Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include, residential, respite, home support services, which includes personal assistants services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding – over €20 million – has been provided specifically for home support services.In the case of older people, from and including 2000, approximately €230 million of additional funding has been provided to the health boards for a range of services, including the home help service, community support structures, the support of carers, support for the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and various voluntary groups, improvement in staff ratios and improvements to the nursing home subvention scheme. Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and the role played by home helps is vital to the success of this policy.Following the publication of the report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, my Department made available a total of €8 million to the health boards between 1999 and 2002 to expand and develop the home help service and provide appropriate training for home helps as recommended in the report. My Department also made available over €20 million to provide for increased pay rates to home helps. Of the above amounts, the Southern Health Board received over €1 million for expansion of the home help service and over €5 million for the improved pay rates.The Southern Health Board has informed me that its strategy for older people entitled Ageing with Confidence, which was launched in October 1999, underlines the importance of the home help as part of the community team and the vital role that they play in realising the expressed wish of older people to remain in their homes for as long as possible. The home help service is delivered within the allocated resources of the board and as provided for in its annual service plan. A sum of €30.8 million has been allocated for the provision of the service in 2003. The moneys allocated will enable the board to provide a home help service to 7,000 clients in 2003The Southern Health Board points out that the levels of home help service within its region have increased significantly over the past number of years, particularly during 2001 and 2002, when an increase of 25 % in service levels was achieved. It should be noted that there has been an increase of 6.2 % in the overall population in the board's area, of which an estimated 5,000 will be over 65, many of whom will require services. In addition, there was an actual increase of 15 % in the population over 85 in the board's area between 1996 and 2000.The board has indicated that the focus of its service in 2003 will be to make the best use of allocated resources which requires careful targeting of the available resources to those most in need. This will be achieved by regular re-assessment of clients' needs. The home help service, by its nature, is a flexible service and, therefore, the level of service being provided may increase or decrease from time to time, depending on the assessed needs of clients. In the Southern Health Board's letter ofdetermination for 2003 there is provision for an additional €1.2 million to support the home help service. The board has assured me that the number of clients availing of the service will not be cut in 2003.The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 February 2003.

The declaration, one of the key documents from the meeting, outlines a wide-ranging work programme and is the blueprint for negotiations which are scheduled to conclude by 2005.The European Union negotiates as a single entity at the WTO. Such negotiations are carried out by the EU Commission acting in accordance with the mandates and policy guidelines decided by the EU Council of Ministers on the basis of Commission proposals. These proposals are developed by a number of committees, which include the EU Trade Committee, also known as the Article 133 Committee. Ireland participates actively in these forums with a view to ensuring that our interests are promoted in the development and implementation of the common commercial policy.The launch of the new round has resulted in substantial consultations with a wide range of interested parties on issues that cross the full spectrum of WTO trade matters. Extensive consultations and dialogue have been undertaken and continues with Departments of State and agencies under their aegis, with business and with wider civil society. For example, in the context of a comprehensive report which has now been finalised by Forfás on recommended negotiating objectives to be pursued by Irish trade negotiators under the new round, there have been extensive consultations with a large cross-section of interested parties, including business. In addition, I and my officials met last year and continue to be available to meet with interested groups and stakeholders on trade matters.

In line with the commitment in the programme for Government in relation to this matter, a national roll-out, on a phased basis, of the preventive strategy to all persons who have been on the live register for more than six months will commence in the Dublin region in April 2003. The launch will be expanded to all regions from May onwards.While the funding of the community employment scheme is being reduced to reflect the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience to training, investment in FÁS training programmes in 2003 is being maintained close to 2002 levels. FÁS will decide on the detailed priorities and breakdown of funding between schemes and activities from within these overall allocations.

I am seriously concerned at the variation in prices which the article indicates. The only effective way to positively affect price levels in the interests of ordinary consumers is to facilitate effective competition and to ensure that shoppers have the necessary choice and information so that they can get the best value available in the goods and services they require. The Competition Authority has the resources and the autonomy to investigate the reasons for price levels which do not seem justifiable and to report publicly on its findings. Investigations are currently under way into a range of professional services, including those provided by doctors, dentists, solicitors, barristers and architects.In the policy areas for which I have political responsibility, I will act promptly on any recommendations which the Competition Authority makes to me. I have already taken the steps necessary to strengthen the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices and my priority is to ensure the removal of unwarranted restrictions on competition in all sectors of the economy. Following a review, I have updated the requirement to indicate product prices regulations. The purpose of these new regulations is to help consumers to be better informed about prices, to make accurate price comparisons between different brands and sizes and, thereby, to get the best available value for money through stimulating more effective competition among retailers and suppliers. I am confident that this clarification and revision of the layout of the previous regulations will make the legislation more transparent and accessible for consumers and traders. The new regulations require that consumers be given a selling price for products and a unit price for goods sold by weight or volume. The regulations come into force on 1 March next and will be enforced rigorously by the Director of Consumer Affairs. In addition, I have increased the penalties to a maximum of €3,000 per offence. The new social partnership agreement includes provision for an anti-inflation initiative and my Department will be represented on the group that is to be specially convened to draw up a detailed action plan in this regard and monitor its progress.

The problems facing the textile industry nationwide are primarily related to competitiveness issues. However, Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work closely with clothing and textile companies in the area to support their competitiveness and grow their business in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. Enterprise Ireland support in the region has been substantial during the period 1999-2002 and the agency is committed to investing heavily in the development of new and existing companies in the years ahead.The response by Enterprise Ireland has focused on four areas of activity: developing existing clients in the region; enhancing the environment for business; identifying and encouraging new high-potential start-up companies in the area; and identifying new opportunities. In addition, the Donegal County Development Board has recently published an integrated strategy for the development of the county. There is a significant focus on inward investment and IDA Ireland is an active participant in this initiative. Indeed, there have been a number of overseas project announcements for the county in recent years. IDA Ireland has also invested in new business parks throughout the county.Overall, the response of the industrial development agencies has been positive. According to the Forfás employment survey, 329 net new jobs were created in the north west region from 1999 to 2002 in non-clothing and textile-related employment. Furthermore, the private sector is also being encouraged to invest in new modern buildings to assist in the marketing of the county for potential new foreign direct investment. A focused agency approach, including the County Enterprise Board, together with a locally based approach is being implemented to address the situation and the area will remain a focus of agency activity and investment in the years ahead.

The report examines a range of competitiveness issues, presenting a picture of the unfolding competitive position across the economy. It establishes that Ireland has improved its ranking in 24 indicators, disimproved in 29 and remained constant in a further 14. The report confirms many of Ireland's strengths while the Challenge document highlights the key challenges we face as well as recommendations for addressing them. The National Competitiveness Council highlighted, in particular, three broad areas of concern to national competitiveness. These are the rapid rise in non-employment costs and consumer prices; employment costs, productivity and social partnership – the rapid rise in wage costs in recent years; and the infrastructure deficit across the country and the costs resulting from this.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The latest Central Statistics Office quarterly industrial employment release gives preliminary estimates of industrial employment for September 2002. These estimates point to a decrease of 18,100 in industrial employment from 271,400 in September 2001 to 253,300 in September 2002. Most of this decline is accounted for by the electronics sector, where employment fell by 11,000. This reflects the global slowdown in the information and communications technology sector and Ireland's decline in manufacturing employment is not unique.Key to employment creation in Ireland, and in particular employment supported by the agencies including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, is the gradual move away from more traditional manufacturing activity towards internationally-traded services activities. This shift in the employment base is reflected by the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey and the latest survey, for the quarter ended August 2002, shows that total persons in employment in all sectors increased by some 320,000 since late 1998, an increase of around 22% over four years. Given the fluctuating world economic climate, and continuing uncertainty in this regard, it is not possible for the industrial development agencies or the CSO to provide definitive forecasts of numbers employed. However, indications from both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are that there should be a substantial flow of foreign direct investment and indigenous projects over the coming months. This will of course depend to a considerable extent on a global economic recovery. The timing and pace of such a recovery is, however, uncertain.

As far as the agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Donegal County Enterprise Board, are concerned these agencies are committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular the BMW region. Under the regional industrial grant aid rates, approved by the EU Commission on 26 October 1999, the grant aid levels for new industrial development projects in the region are set at 40% plus a further 15% allowable for small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, for the period 2000-2006. This compares with an aid level of just 17.5%, plus a further 10% for SMEs, in the Dublin area. Additional aid for training and research and development may also be approved.Of the jobs created in 2000, 2001 and 2002, the tabular statement, which is included in the official reply, shows that almost 20% were located in the BMW region and 80% in the rest of the country. This is broadly in line with the share of population and labour force in the BMW region.

The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, provides for an annual leave entitlement of four working weeks per annum for full-time employees and pro rata entitlements for part-time employees as well as an average hourly working week of 48 hours averaged generally over a four month period. The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish.I have no plans to increase the statutory minimum annual leave or public holiday entitlement or to lower the threshold on weekly working hours provided for in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

The key areas highlighted by the council as being of concern were: prices and costs – the rapid rise in non-employment costs and consumer prices; employment costs, productivity and social partnership – the rapid rise in wage costs in recent years; infrastructure – the infrastructure deficit across the country and the costs resulting from this.Both the domestic economy and the global economy face difficult times ahead. Given that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world, it is important that steps are taken to position the economy to maximise the benefits and growth potential from any upturn in the global economy. Renewing competitiveness both within the domestic economy and on the international stage has also been identified by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, as vital, and that is the reason I have ensured it has been factored into the recent discussions on a successor to the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness.

The revised procedures are also intended to ensure that persons available locally or in the wider EEA area are given first preference, as required by our status as an EU member state. On a local labour market basis, FÁS, in consultation with my Department, will look at the occupational categories and skills profiles of persons registered with FÁS and compare these with the profile of vacancies being registered by employers. Where it is clear there is a significant pool of suitable labour available locally, my Department, on the recommendation of FÁS, will not consider an application for a work permit in that category and FÁS will assist employers in filling vacancies. The local labour market assessment, by occupational category, will be revised on a quarterly basis.In cases where it is not clear that a suitable pool of labour is available locally and where the employer has made a genuine attempt to recruit an EEA national, the employer will be able to apply for a work permit. The new procedures should help to provide a better service in assisting employers to find suitable staff and to enable them to do so more efficiently when specific skills are agreed to be in short supply. In such cases the present four week advertising period may not be necessary.It is intended that the operation of the new procedures will be pragmatic and that the particular characteristics and needs of horticulture and similar sectors will be taken into account. Officials of my Department will shortly meet representatives of the horticultural sector to discuss the issues arising.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	538	It is not possible to estimate the potential number of manufacturing jobs that may be lost over the next five years due to the transfer of companies to lower cost locations, as such moves depend on a range of factors and company decisions to which Government agencies are not always party. However, given the open nature of the Irish economy, maintaining our competitiveness will be critical to sustaining and developing the manufacturing sector, both traditional and innovative, in Ireland over the coming years.The strategy being pursued to maintain Irish industry's position is focused on ensuring that the enterprise sector can continue to compete fully with firms in competitor countries. For Irish firms to compete, the development agencies are working the enterprise base to increase labour productivity in existing firms; encourage innovation in all companies; accelerate the shift towards high growth, high tech, high productivity activities; promote continuous upgrading of the educational and skills profile of the workforce and to promote a deepening of the base of Research and Development performing firms. A number of initiatives to sustain the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Ireland are currently being pursued. IDA Ireland, for example, is working to increase the embeddedness and competitive position of existing foreign companies in Ireland by attracting additional functions to the Irish subsidiary across the full value chain, but with a particular emphasis on research and development, and also by increasing the competence of existing functions.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 142 together.I share the Deputies' concerns about the job losses over recent months in Ballinasloe and Athlone and I recognise the impact on the lives of workers, their families and the local community.In an effort to lessen the impact of the Square D closure in Ballinasloe, the North American division of the parent company, Schneider Electric, has stated that it is committed to working with IDA Ireland to find potential clients for the Ballinasloe plant, to assist employees to obtain new jobs and to provide outplacement assistance and job search training. The agencies under the remit of my Department are also working assiduously to lessen the impact of the closure. IDA has already brought two clients to view the plant and will continue to explore other possibilities as well as seeking out other potential clients. Enterprise Ireland has also begun discussions with the company to offer support for any possible start ups by local senior management. FÁS, the national training authority, has been in contact with the company and will provide a range of training courses which will be designed to meet the skill needs of individuals to enhance their employability, while providing the area with a skilled work force.IDA Ireland is committed to the development of Ballinasloe and is actively promoting the town for new foreign investment. The IDA acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe for development as a new business park. Development work has been completed on the park and the IDA co-operated with local developers to construct a 27,000 sq. ft. advance unit on the park. The IDA has been successful in attracting Valois, a French engineering company, to establish a manufacturing operation in this new unit. Planning permission has been lodged for a second advance building on the park. Construction will commence immediately on receipt of same and the IDA has already begun marketing this facility. Enterprise Ireland, EI, has approved funding of €120,000 for the work in progress at the community owned enterprise centre in Ballinasloe and it is understood that there is still some space available for potential projects.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	541	The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for enforcing certain aspects of employment rights legislation, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. All inspectors carry out night work as part of their normal conditions of service and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to their role in enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. Targeted inspections are often by way of out of normal office hours inspection activity, throughout various employment sectors, including fast food outlets, restaurants, licensed premises and hotels. Breaches of the Act come to the attention of my Department by way of complaint by an  individual employee or other concerned person or by the targeted inspections carried out by my Department's inspectors.Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the provisions of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996, the matter is referred to my Department's legal advisers for consideration as to the initiation of legal proceedings. During the years 2001 to date some 2,613 inspections under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 were undertaken. Of these, 1,705 inspections were undertaken during regular day time inspection activity while 908 inspections were undertaken as part of night time inspection activity. In addition, the employment rights information unit of my Department concluded a pro-active awareness campaign during 2002 whereby all secondary schools were circulated with information on all aspects of employment law, including details of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. Work has already commenced on a similar campaign this year. Staff of that unit also visit secondary schools, citizen information centres and other organisations to disseminate information on general labour law, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.Accordingly, I am satisfied there are sufficient procedures in place and an appropriate level of inspection activity to ensure that the provisions of Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 are being complied with. If there is evidence that employers are breaking the law, I ask that the relevant details be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.The Government authorised an increase in the number of labour inspectors to seventeen inspectors, which equated to an almost 100% increase in personnel, in conjunction with the introduction of a national minimum wage in 2000. While the number of serving inspectors has fluctuated in the interim, the inspectorate is now operating to almost full strength. There are no plans at this stage to increase the number of inspectors further.

If, as I hope, the agreement is ratified, it is my firm intention to bring the increased statutory redundancy payments into effect at the earliest possible date. Much preparatory work has been undertaken in my Department in anticipation of a favourable outcome to the ratification process.Heads of a Bill have been drafted and it is intended to expedite the drafting of the legislation, which is required to bring into effect the new statutory redundancy rates. There is no evidence to suggest that employers are bringing forward planned redundancies in order to avoid paying the proposed increased redundancy rates.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	543	In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced in line with reduced levels of long-term unemployment and a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports. There were 24,991 participants on CE at the beginning of January and the projected year end participation rate is 20,000. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000.The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context a cross departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which should be finalised shortly.The outcome of these initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I am aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including for those involved in the haulage business. I am in favour of a more open market for insurance cover and I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market to help bring this about.My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. I expect the study to provide important pointers to the reasons there are not more foreign insurers willing to underwrite insurance in Ireland.With regard to Government action to address the difficulties being faced by companies, on 25 October last I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target time frame; establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. However, there is an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	545	On 6 December 2002, my office was advised by IDA Ireland that Wilo Pumps Limited would be reducing its manufacturing operation by 85 jobs at its plant in Limerick and that the announcement would be made on 9 December 2002. IDA Ireland had been working closely with local management of the company in order to maintain the operation's sustainability within the group and I regret the decision by Wilo Pumps Limited to downsize its Irish operation. I understand the company decided that it was necessary to reduce production capacity to achieve required cost efficiencies, logistic advantages and improved economies of scale for the group overall. However, I also understand that the company will retain its existing assembly operation in Limerick, which employs 12 people.In reaction to the closure announcement, FÁS representatives visited the plant on 13 and 17 December 2002, with presentations and registrations being offered to all employees. Eighty employees have since registered with FÁS. A total of 44 staff expressed interest in training, 24 of whom requested the introduction to computers course. Subsequently, 11 staff took up a place on a specially arranged introduction to computers course, which commenced on 10 February, 2003.There is a strong base of existing IDA supported companies in County Limerick employing approximately 10,000 people. The IDA actively works with these companies to increase their strategic importance to the parent operation, thereby further embedding them in the region. IDA Ireland continuously monitors the position of firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors, to identify both opportunities and threats to employment. The reasons for such relocation are many, varied and complex and, on balance, Ireland continues to benefit from such movement due to the underlying strength of our economy despite the recent world downturn. The IDA cannot be competitive in all types of industrial activity and the agency continues to seek to secure worthwhile employment for our people in areas where Ireland has a competitive advantage.

The live register is not an accurate measure of unemployment. It includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers who are entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, QNHS. Laois and Offaly form part of the midlands for statistical purposes, along with Longford and Westmeath.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The issue of job creation is a day to day issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and is one in which I have no direct function. In the 12 month period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002 a total of 44,394 job losses were recorded by all the enterprise development agencies. The number of jobs created by the agencies during this period was 35,263.The strategies of the enterprise development agencies, the two main ones being IDA Ireland for foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland for indigenous industry, are firmly fixed on building and providing the infrastructure for high value added and knowledge intensive industries. In regard to foreign direct investment, the number of new investments secured by IDA Ireland in 2002 was up by two thirds on 2001, with 55 new projects in manufacturing and international services negotiated by the IDA during 2002 compared with 33 in 2001. These projects are committed to creating 8,700 new jobs as they come on stream over the next few years. In addition, the IDA Ireland strategy of delivering 50% of all new greenfield jobs approved to the objective one regions was more than achieved in 2002.Enterprise Ireland has identified a number of key factors which impact on the employment levels within its indigenous client companies namely, the weak international trading environment, the weakening competitiveness of companies due to pressure on wage bills, packaging costs, insurance premiums and oil prices and the strengthening euro against both the US dollar and UK sterling. Enterprise Ireland will continue to work closely with clients to seek to minimise the negative impact of these factors by encouraging and supporting new high potential start up companies, developing exports, increasing innovation and improving competitiveness with existing clients and by the development of incubator space through webworks, IT incubation centres and community enterprise centres.IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland's commitment to regional development is stronger than ever and, with the national spatial strategy now in place, both agencies are determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction in each region and are working in strong partnership with other organisations at national and local level to influence the delivery of projects to the regions.

The European competitiveness summit provides Ireland with a unique opportunity to host this prestigious event bringing together EU and US leaders in politics, business and academia. The  summit will bring a welcome focus to the competitiveness agenda in advance of our EU Presidency in 2004. A strong focus will also be placed on issues of social inclusion, corporate social responsibility and entrepreneurship.In addition to its flagship event in Davos each year, the World Economic Forum brings together thousands of decision makers in regional summits and meetings to address the most crucial regional issues. These events enable members and constituents to discuss key issues and trends affecting the region by sharing first hand information and insights. This first European competitiveness summit presents us with an important opportunity to capture knowledge from leading political, business and academic experts. I hope this forum will have the capacity to influence change and drive the reforms needed to build competitiveness and greater social inclusion in the European Union.

The Minister made it clear that given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultation with interested parties on the design of the tax. This commitment to consultation is reiterated in the draft social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which states that in keeping with Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the announcement in the budget regarding the development of a general carbon tax, there will be full consultation with the social partners having regard to the potential implications for jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion; I expect that the Minister for Finance will initiate consultations to develop a framework for the tax shortly.

There is in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code, including detailed regulations dealing specifically with the construction sector that place legal obligations on a wide range of people including clients, designers, contractors and employers.The sub-contracting of specialist work by main contractors to sub-contractors is an established practice, both in Ireland and other European countries. The primary purpose of sub-contracting is to allow the main contractor to take on a larger volume, and a wider range, of work than would be possible if limited to the labour force directly employed by the main contractor.As regards the direct impact of sub-contracting on health and safety standards, notwithstanding the economic or business considerations behind the practice of sub-contracting, it should not lead to a lessening of on-site health and safety standards. The operation of a sub-contracting system should not, of its own accord, preclude or prevent the development of good on-site health and safety standards in accordance with statutory requirements.

However, the Labour Inspectorate continues to pursue the employment rights aspect of this case. Inspectors have interviewed the employer concerned and have examined some records in accordance with the relevant employment legislation. The inspectorate is not yet in a position to make a decision as to the appropriate next steps on the case as the investigative process is still ongoing. However, the  inspectorate expects to be in a position over the coming weeks to progress the matter further.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The insurance annual report – the Blue Book – presents detailed information on the Irish insurance industry in 2001. The information is sourced primarily from the regulatory financial returns which insurance companies are required to provide to the insurance division of my Department. The report also provides more general information both on regulatory developments and significant issues which affected the sector during 2001. I am happy to report that due to my Department's continued policy of stringent and prudential supervision of all insurance companies, we had no insurance failures this year.During 2001 there was 150 insurance undertakings supervised by my Department. In addition, we were notified of three new branches of insurance companies from other jurisdictions wishing to establish in Ireland and 12 additional companies wishing to write into Ireland on a freedom of services basis from other EU jurisdictions. At the end of 2001 there was 12,168 people employed by insurance companies in Ireland. Total premium income received by Irish insurance companies during 2001 amounted to €18.9 billion.As the Deputy will be aware, 2001 was a difficult year for the insurance sector worldwide, particularly the non-life sector, with hardening insurance markets, and of course the tragic events of 11 September. The returns submitted by the Irish non-life companies indicated that they had suffered a loss on their underwriting business. However, when the strong investments returns attributable to the underwriting account were factored in, there was an overall profit on the technical account of €278 million. This represented a significant improvement on the prior year returns.As I announced last year, the current format of the insurance annual report will be revised to make the document more user-friendly for the general consumer. This is in keeping with the recommendation made by the Motor Insurance Advisory Bureau. At present the blue book which is available to the public both from the Government's publication office and from my Department's website, is primarily used as an industry resource.

The Irish Business Against Litter Group – IBAL – sponsored the building of this 28,000 square feet facility, which offers a large open production and manufacturing floor of 25,000 square feet and a smaller office area of 3,000 square feet.There have been a number of meetings this year between IDA Ireland and Waterford County Council, also involving the Waterford County Enterprise Board, concerning the marketing of the building. Both the IDA's south east regional office and IDA's property division based in Athlone, are involved in marketing the facility to new and existing foreign direct investment companies. Full details of the building are available to all IDA staff, including their overseas network, on IDA's property database. The starting point with any potential itinerary is to agree on the regions or cities and towns that the company will visit. Suitable property based on that company's requirements is then shown as part of the itinerary.

The current system of rights and responsibilities has developed, very often, in response to EU initiatives and has been grafted on to existing institutions. The Government is committed to reviewing the employment rights bodies and my Department will initiate this review towards the end of the year. It is envisaged that the review will consider the current employment rights legislation and the legislation governing the Labour Court, the LRC, the rights commissioner service and the employment appeals  tribunal. The aim of the review will be to make recommendations on the services of the employment rights bodies to ensure that these are clear, coherent and user-friendly.

There is a policy in place in my Department whereby the processing of work permit applications for any employer is suspended when the Department becomes aware of any concerns regarding that employer's compliance with the obligations set out in the various employment rights enactments. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting foreign workers employed under the work permit system, I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including foreign workers employed under the work permit system. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment for all the various categories of workers employed in Ireland and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seek redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The Inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to foreign workers employed under the work permit system in exactly the same manner as it does to native Irish or EU workers.

That meeting was attended by the Ministers as stated above and senior officials from the respective Departments. As a follow-up to that meeting four other bilateral meetings have taken place involving the various Departments and the Irish Insurance Federation. These meetings were attended by senior officials. Another ministerial meeting has been scheduled to take place within the next two weeks.Progress has been made on the majority of the MIAB recommendations and, to date, ten have been implemented. EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. However, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken as outlined in my reform programme will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers. I expect such benefits to accrue when more of the reforms are in place.

While I do not have specific information on insurance premium increases, I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including for motorists. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain recent high increases in premiums, including low investment returns, the 11 September attacks in the US, high levels of compensation and the cost of settling claims.On 25 October 2002, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the Implementation Group on the PIAB.I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premiums to consumers. I am committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, finalised terms of reference last December for a study being undertaken into the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. The terms of reference are available at www.entemp.ie and www.tca.ie. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.

The chairperson has engaged in an intensive round of bilateral contacts with members of the interim board. These bilateral meetings have covered matters relating to the future work of the board, for example, the compilation of a database of court awards. In this regard, a considerable amount of information on court awards has been obtained from the Courts Service for study. Discussions have also commenced in relation to the future ongoing monitoring of delivery costs of compensation in the PIAB system. This preparatory work has allowed the members to familiarise themselves with the work to be done and with each other and will enable the Board to ‘hit the ground running' immediately.Arrangements are currently being made for the holding of the inaugural meeting of the board later this month. One of the tasks of the interim board is to contribute to the preparation of the requisite legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory basis. It is difficult to give a precise indication of when the legislation will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the preparation of the legislation is being given priority.

I have not received any requests for funding from the IDA in relation to the remedial works for the sewer and services at Ballybrit. I understand that the services in question were constructed by IDA Ireland in the mid 1970s and involved bringing foul sewer-surface sewer and water services from the then existing services at IDA Ireland's Ballybrit industrial estate to service new lands acquired by the agency at Parkmore, located to the west of Galway City.These services are owned by IDA Ireland and are the sole means of providing these services to the Galway Business and Technology Park, Parkmore East and West. At the time of construction, all costs attributed to the development of these services were borne by IDA Ireland. While IDA Ireland has indicated it has no objection in principle to the taking-in-charge of these services by Galway County Council, it must be noted that this would represent no strategic benefit to the agency in its industrial development remit. Thus, it is the view of the IDA that, in any such transfer, a proportion of the remaining capacity in both the foul sewer and the water supply must be available to industry locating on the Galway Business and Technology Park, Parkmore East and West. This remaining capacity is vital for the future marketing and development of the Galway Business and Technology Park, which is dependent on having a water supply and foul disposal capability that meets with the potential needs of IDA client companies.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	588	It is not possible to estimate the potential number of manufacturing jobs that may be lost over the next five years due to the transfer of companies to lower cost locations, as such moves depend on a range of factors and company decisions to which Government agencies are not always party. However, that having been said, and given the open nature of the Irish economy, maintaining our competitiveness will be critical to sustaining and developing the manufacturing sector, both traditional and innovative, in Ireland over the coming years.The strategy being pursued to maintain Irish industry's position is focused on ensuring that the enterprise sector can continue to compete fully with firms in competitor countries. For Irish firms to compete, the development agencies are working the enterprise base to increase labour productivity in existing firms; encourage innovation in all companies; accelerate the shift towards high-growth, high-tech, high-productivity activities; promote continuous upgrading of the educational and skills profile of the workforce; and promote a deepening of the base of R&D performing firms.A number of initiatives to sustain the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Ireland are currently being pursued. For example, IDA Ireland is working to increase the embeddedness and competitive position of existing foreign companies in Ireland by attracting additional functions to the Irish subsidiary across the full value chain, but with a particular emphasis on research and development, and also by increasing the competence of existing functions.Enterprise Ireland is working closely with existing clients in the traditional business sectors and is assisting them by providing advice and referrals, operating a dedicated competitiveness fund, developing exports through trade promotions and provision of incubator space, and through a range of new initiatives such as market mentors, training workshops and market visits, which are geared towards clients developing export markets for the first time. In addition, Enterprise Ireland and the other development agencies continue to be active participants in a range of task forces and other working groups established to ameliorate the effects on local communities of downsizing and company closures by identifying new opportunities for enterprise development and working with new promoters to build viable projects.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Given the importance of the IT sector to the economy, the Government keeps under regular review the situation with regard to supply and demand for IT skills. In response to the considerable growth in recent years in the demand for persons with IT skills, State investment in relevant education and training was considerably expanded and the current provision is broadly adequate to meet the foreseeable demands for IT skills in the economy. The challenge for the future is to continue to provide for the range of skills, and particularly the higher level skills, which are increasingly in demand in the sector. For this reason, investment in IT training continues to be of importance in developing the Irish workforce and supporting future economic growth in the sector.In the last few years, when it was obvious that the supply of skills, having regard to the output from Irish colleges and training institutions, was inadequate to meet the skill needs of the economy, I was happy to support the attraction to Ireland of skilled IT professionals through the operation of the working visa-work authorisation scheme. The downturn in the global economy and particularly the IT sector now suggests that it would be timely to look again at the sector specific forecast of the likely demand and supply for ICT skills into the medium term which was set out in the third report of the expert group on future skills needs. The EGFSN has planned to undertake a new study of the IT sector this year. I look forward to their report as an important input to the development of Government policy in this area.

As it is not clear that a significant recovery will occur in the short-term, the Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has been assisting exporters by focusing on actions with near to market impact.This approach is focused on internationalisation and seeking new markets by making a sustained effort to help Irish companies gain access to potential export market opportunities and raise their level of innovation both in product and process terms. A number of new initiatives are being introduced in 2003, such as the introduction of an in-market mentor panel in the UK and in key European markets.The following lists the current activities being undertaken by Enterprise Ireland to assist companies in internationalisation and in finding new markets: running workshops, seminars and exploratory market visits to familiarise companies with the requirements of successful export market penetration; providing access to international market reports and undertaking research on behalf of clients, or groups of clients, to identify specific opportunities; identifying, recruiting or upskilling key marketing personnel and specialist consultants; providing access to potential buyers-partners-distributors through individual itineraries, trade missions, participation at trade fairs or through introductions to buyers on inward missions; and providing incubator space in overseas markets for early stage market entrants and supporting these incubators with back-up services.Enterprise Ireland is also seeking to raise the level of innovation in client companies, both in products and process terms, by supporting individual company applied research programmes through the RTI initiative and supporting the applied research programmes in the research institutes – including third level colleges – and developing mechanisms for the transfer of technologies from the research institutes into commercial projects.

The decrease is, in the main, reflected in the funding of the  community employment scheme, CE. This is consistent with the Government's decision to restructure CE with levels being reduced gradually to reflect the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training. Overall investment in FÁS training programmes in 2003 is being maintained close to 2002 levels with funding of €295.573 million being made available compared to €301.018 million in 2002. FÁS, taking into account policy guidelines, will decide on the priorities between schemes and activities from within this allocation. In this context FÁS will be required to maximise the benefits to its client base of the available funding through greater efficiencies.

However, the reasons behind specific relocations are closely examined by my Department and its agencies in the context of maintaining Ireland as an attractive and competitive location for investment. Factors contributing to a decision to relocate all or part of an enterprise may include consolidation, merger or acquisition, or changes in product or market focus, in addition to relative wage rates and other costs and available incentives. Ireland both gains and loses from such decisions, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years with losses being counteracted by firms choosing this country as a location for certain higher value added business functions. To facilitate enterprise development, the focus is on strengthening Ireland's research capacity, enhancing our skills base, implementing infrastructural improvements, and shaping the regulatory environment. Competitiveness in world markets is also a key factor in negotiations on post-PPF arrangements and control of public spending.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter. Therefore, I do not have specific information on insurance premium increases. However, I am very much aware of the high cost of insurance in the State and I am concerned about the difficulties this is causing generally, including in the business area.On 25 October last, I announced my programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on an interim basis, pending preparation of the necessary legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory footing and; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	600	I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 217, inclusive, together.The Gulfstream IV was leased initially for a period of ten years from December 1991 to December 2001 for use as a ministerial air transport aircraft. The lease contained a purchase option which was exercised at the termination of the lease period. The ministerial air transport service is being reviewed at present in the light of this country's presidency of the European Union in 2004 and requirements in the longer term. The retention or disposal of the Gulfstream IV will be considered in the context of this review and a decision in this matter is expected shortly.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I am informed by the military authorities that an applicant for enlistment with the reserve must be ordinarily resident within the State for the purposes of joining the Reserve Defence Force. The relevant Defence Force regulation states that a person ordinarily resident outside the State is ineligible for FCA enlistment. There is a specific provision that a person who is residing temporarily within the State, for the purpose of attending a course of education, and who is ordinarily resident in Ireland, may however be enlisted. I will have these particular provisions examined by the relevant military authorities with a view to an evaluation of their contemporary relevance as regards policy and practical administration. The general residence criterion within the relevant regulations has existed since before World War II.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I have been advised by the military authorities that there are no currently no plans under consideration to withdraw any item of uniform currently issued to members of the Reserve Defence Forces.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The gross provision for Defence in the abridged version of the Estimates for 2003 is in line with the amount recommended by the Estimates review committee. It had recommended, among other things, that the second phase of the armoured personnel carrier programme be postponed, that the proposed spend on trainer aircraft be reduced by 50% and that expenditure on the capital building programme be reduced by €6 million. However, by re-allocating moneys within the overall provision in 2002 and 2003, it has been possible to proceed with the acquisition of eight trainer air craft and an additional 25 armoured personnel carriers. The amount provided for the capital building programme in 2003 was reduced by only €2 million instead of the €6 million recommended by the committee.Regarding the proceeds from the sale of surplus property, the committee recommended that, with effect from 2003, estimated receipts should be included under appropriations-in-aid in the Defence Vote. However, it has been decided to continue to bring such receipts to account as extra Exchequer receipts.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The national development plan includes no Defence elements, projects or outlay.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	605	As I stated previously in reply to Questions Nos. 155, 156 and 157 on 12 November 2002, my Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin. The Department is in the process of effecting first registration on the title to this property in the Land Registry and the contract of sale is expected to be finalised shortly.Florence Properties issued a press release in November last indicating that it had agreed to purchase the property in question. The press release said that "Florence Properties (Ireland) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Florence Properties (Jersey) which is owned by a trust company, the beneficiaries of which are the family of Irish-born property developer David Kennedy".
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	606	Transfers from the EU in 2002 in agriculture subsidies and payments amounted to €1.7 billion, some €1.4 billion of which was paid  directly to farmers. The balance of the moneys was paid to the agriculture processing industry in various forms of market support. None of the EU moneys was used on administration costs. Such costs across all schemes operated by my Department are funded by the Exchequer.The main areas of EU expenditure on agriculture and food in 2002 were as follows:
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The position in the case of the person named is that the transfer of quota requested does not comply with the regulations because it involves the transfer of a milk quota without the land to which it is attached. It cannot therefore be approved.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Under the on-farm market valuation scheme, TB and brucellosis reactors are valued by an independent valuer. Subject to the provisions of the scheme, my Department pays the farmer the difference between this valuation and the salvage value of the carcass which is paid directly to the farmer by the meat factory. The reactor animal remains at all times the property of the farmer.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	609	Further to the introduction of EEC Council and Commission regulations in the early 1980s, beef carcass classification became a requirement in each member state. Its main function is to provide a standardised method for reporting the price paid for slaughtered animals. The weekly price data from each member state, when collated and analysed by the European Commission, provides a basis for market management decisions under the common organisation of the market. In addition, carcass classification facilitates an equitable basis for payment to the producer because it provides an effective predictor of meat yield. The cost to operate the beef carcass classification scheme and other related duties is of the order of €4.25 million per annum.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The Deputy is presumably referring to cases where details of bovine animals sold through marts, including a record of the new herdowners, have not been notified to the animal identification and tracing database, CMMS.There is on going monitoring of the accuracy and comprehensive nature of all information notified to the CMMS database, including data received from marts. Where gaps are identified in data, additional procedures are applied to ensure the accuracy and comprehensive nature of the information provided. Discussions are continuing with the representative trade organisations of all groups providing data, including marts, to address these matters.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium-scale milk producers has been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome. The person named submitted an application relating to this quota under the farm modernisation scheme category. Unfortunately, as the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied, an allocation was not made. Notification to that effect was sent to the applicant.An appeals procedure exists for this scheme and the person named has submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed, each appellant will be notified of the outcome.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The independent Estimates review committee was commissioned by the Minister for Finance to advise him on the Estimates process for 2003. The report of the committee contained a range of recommendations which were reflected in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2003, published last November.In so far as my Department is concerned, the recommendations provide for improved efficiencies in the area of research and testing, increased disease levies, the phasing out of State support for the disposal of meat and bonemeal and reduced grant aid for Bord Bia and Bord Glas, with a view to the amalgamation of the two bodies in the longer term to achieve greater efficiencies in the promotion of Irish produce.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	613	A preliminary survey of the plot in question has been carried out and it has been discovered that the current boundaries of the plot appear to be the result of an amalgamation of five separate plots. The current position on the ground no longer reflects the position that obtained when the former Land Commission, some considerable time ago, published the original list of vested holdings of which this plot once formed part. Neither the person named in the question who is in occupation of the plot or her immediate predecessor purchased the land from the former Land Commission.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	614	The delay in making payment in this case arose from the fact that it was necessary to write to the person concerned seeking information on the stocking density on the holding. This matter has been resolved and the person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme as soon as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	615	The 2002 area aid application of the person named was processed with an area of 25.53 hectares determined for payment purposes. However an additional area comprising some 15.85 hectares relating to a commonage share held by the herdowner should also have been included in the overall area determined for payment purposes. This omission has been rectified resulting in a revised total area of 41.38 hectares being determined for area aid. Payment due under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme will issue as soon as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The 2002 area aid application of the person named was processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 22.06 hectares. However, an additional area comprising 12 hectares relating to a commonage share held by the herdowner should also have been included in the overall area determined for payment purposes. This omission has been rectified resulting in a revised total area of 34.06 hectares. Payment due under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme will issue as soon as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The person named submitted two applications for special beef premium in respect of seven animals for second age premium on 24 December and five animals for first age premium on 30 December 2002.As stated in the terms and conditions governing the scheme, the date of receipt of an application determines the eligibility of the animal based on the age of the animal on that date. It also states that only animals aged over 20 months old are eligible for the second age premium and the eligibility dates for each premium are printed on the cattle identity cards.Given the Christmas holiday period, special arrangements were made by my Department to provide for the acceptance of special beef premium application forms at local offices as well as at the special beef premium unit in Portlaoise on all working days over the holiday period.The application received in the special beef premium unit on 24 December 2002 was processed according to the date of receipt which resulted in six of the animals applied on being too young for the second age premium. These animals were not eligible until dates ranging between 27 December and 30 December.These animals may be re-applied on under the 2003 special beef premium scheme if they are still in the possession of the person named and if they are otherwise eligible as per the terms and conditions of the scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The person named applied for premium for six animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. Payment of the 80% advance instalment issued on 16 October 2002. However, in processing the application for balance payment, it was found that two animals, tag numbers UFA656479 and UIA709933, were disposed of inside the six month retention period and were not replaced, as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme. The herdowner has been contacted by the district livestock office of my Department regarding this matter. The medical certificate submitted is being considered and a decision will be notified to the person named as soon as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	619	The 2002 area aid application of the person named was received late in the Department but was accepted on grounds of force majeure. The application was fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 26.54 hectares. The person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme as soon as possible.The person named lodged one application for special beef premium on 29 January 2002 for 24 animals. The advance payment issued on 16 October 2002.The person named has 45 animals eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme with 32 of these also eligible under the national envelope top-up. Advance payment for the amounts of €2,880 and €584.96 issued on 16 October 2002 for the respective schemes. Balancing payments on all bovine schemes will issue from April 2003.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	620	In this case one application was lodged for special beef premium dated 12 March 2002. The application was processed and an 80% advance was paid on nine animals.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The person named submitted an area aid application, which included land that was also claimed by another herdowner. My Department contacted both herdowners to clarify the matter. Both herdowners responded indicating that they did have the right to claim the area in question. In order to resolve this issue an inspection of the land parcel in question will take place shortly. Until this matter is resolved the area aid application of the person named cannot be fully processed and no further area related payments can issue.The person named was paid €1,172.33 on 20 September 2002 under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 13.19 hectares of more severely handicapped land at €88.88 per hectare. This payment may need to be reviewed depending on the outcome of inquiries relative to the parcel for which there is a duplicate claim.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	622	Following the announcement of the changes to the 1994 scheme of early retirement, my Department has identified about 130 cases where payment of pension may have been affected by the application of the rules on enlargement and farming as a main occupation after the first five years participation in the scheme had been completed.The changes agreed by the European Commission mean that the obligations on the transferee – the person who took over the farm – to have enlargement land and to engage in farming as a main occupation are now confined to the first five years of participation in the scheme. Once the transferee has satisfied these conditions for five years, those conditions cease to apply though the transferee must continue to farm the pension lands, the lands transferred by the retiring farmer, for the full period of the pension.My Department is currently contacting people who may benefit from the changes, with a view to establishing their eligibility for further payment of pension. Until these inquiries are complete it is not possible to confirm the number of pensions that are likely to be reinstated. In a number of cases, eligibility for further payment of the early retirement pension may be affected by whether the participant, or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management application, is receiving a national retirement pension. Under the governing EU regulation, the early retirement pension is payable only as a supplement to a national retirement pension.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The arrangements for the implementation of the commonage framework plans were finalised after a series of meetings between my officials and the farming organisations stretching over several months and covering a wide range of issues. I am fully aware of the concerns of farmers and the arrangements that I have now put in place afford farmers the maximum flexibility compatible with the 1998 agreement on commonages between my Department and the European Commission. That agreement formed the basis on which I have been able since 1999 to make generous payments of up to €242 per hectare on commonage land to farmers in REPS. I am satisfied there is no scope for further concessions.Farmers who are required to destock under the commonage framework plans may either join REPS and accept the generous payment rates negotiated in 1998, or alternatively they may apply for compensation under a national scheme to be operated by Dúchas. I understand that discussions on this scheme between Dúchas and the European Commission are at an advanced stage.I have recently announced the arrangements to enable farmers to appeal the destocking levels recommended in commonage framework plans. The appeals process will consist of a reassessment of the plan by a second approved framework planning team, and a contribution of up to €1,300 will be available towards the cost of each appeal.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	624	The information requested on a herd breakdown basis is as follows:
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and the current scheme introduced in November 2000 are both governed by EU Council regulations. It is a requirement of these regulations that the early retirement pension may be paid only as a supplement to any national retirement pension payable. This means that any national retirement pension payable to a participant in the scheme, or to his or her spouse or partner in a joint management application, must be deducted from the early retirement pension.The overpayment for the person named, amounting to €1,465.89, arose because he was getting the full amount of an early retirement pension and was also receiving the national non-contributory old age pension at the same time. My Department is obliged to recover all such overpayments under the scheme. However, my officials will consider sympathetically any proposals the person named may wish to make to repay the full amount over a period of time.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	626	Under EU regulations governing the 2001 special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	627	The person named submitted two applications for 1997 special beef premium in respect of 72 animals and full payment has issued.The person named submitted four applications for 1996 special beef premium in respect of 155 animals as follows: first age premium, 41 animals on 4 January 1996 and 34 animals on 27 November 1996; second age premium, 38 animals on 4 January 1996 and 42 animals on 27 November 1996.Under EU regulations governing the 1996 special beef premium scheme a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. Each producer's reckonable livestock units are obtained in respect of the calendar year as follows:
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	628	Payment due under the area based compensatory allowance scheme was deducted from the person named to offset an overpayment raised as a result of an eligibility audit on the 2001 EU arable aid scheme. This eligibility problem has since been reviewed and resolved. A refund of the area based compensatory allowance due to the person named has now been arranged and will be made as soon as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases. The person named submitted an application in relation to this quota, under the farm modernisation scheme category. Unfortunately, as the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied an allocation was not made. Notification to that effect was sent to the applicant.An appeals procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named has submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The application referred to is one of a number of similar applications on hand at present. EU Council Directive 97/12 requires that export lairages be under the supervision of an official veterinarian. It is neither practical nor reasonable to expect that my Department can supervise an unlimited number of such premises.In this instance, there are a significant number of services competing for veterinary time in the area in which it is intended to operate this lairage. These include services relating to BSE and scrapie, TB and brucellosis, veterinary supervision at slaughter plants, veterinary inspection of live exports and other similar services. In addition, from the point of view of facilitating live exports, the number of assembly centres currently approved is not a limitation on the numbers of animals, which may be exported.In these circumstances the applicant in question has been informed that approval to operate as an assembly centre is not feasible at this time. The matter will be kept under review, however, and should there be any change in current circumstances the application referred to in the Deputy's question will be re-considered.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The NDP measures within my Department's remit are contained in the CAP rural development plan and various operational programmes. Total public expenditure under these headings in 2002 was €529 million. Of this, €3 million concerned initiatives – research stimulus fund, cattle and equine breeding – whose expenditure is not attributable on a county basis. Of the balance of €526 million, 1.97% or €10 million related to County Waterford.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases. The person named submitted an application in relation to this quota, under the animal disease category. To qualify for an allocation in this category, a producer, in addition to other conditions, had to have lost more than 10% of the dairy herd in one of the years 1978, 1979, or 1980; and had to have total deliveries in at least one of those years greater than his 1984 quota plus subsequent national reserve allocations. Although the person named satisfied the former condition, he did not satisfy the latter and therefore was not eligible for an allocation.An appeals procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named has submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The person involved is a participant in the 1994 early retirement scheme introduced  under EU Council regulation 2079/92, which she entered in joint management with her husband.It is a requirement of the Council Regulation that any national retirement pension to which a scheme participant or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management situation becomes entitled must be deducted from the early retirement pension. The husband of the person named was in receipt of a contributory old age pension before she joined the early retirement scheme and in accordance with the regulation this must be deducted from the early retirement pension.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The body reported in July 2002. Under the terms of reference, the body was requested to have regard to "the need to underpin Ireland's competitiveness and develop our economic prosperity on a sustainable basis".The implementation of the body's report is a central feature of the new programme "Sustaining Progress" which is currently being considered by the unions and employers. Under that agreement the payment of the pay increases in the public service is clearly dependent on industrial peace, co-operation with ongoing change and the achievement of certain objectives. This will improve the delivery of services to the public. The new programme will underpin Ireland's competitiveness and help safeguard employment. I do not see that the implementation of the body's report in the context of a new agreement, if ratified, would be contrary to these objectives.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	635	Overall Government policy on the information society was initially set out in the report "Implementing the Information Society in Ireland: An Action Plan" published by the Department of the Taoiseach in January 1999. A new Action Plan  entitled "New Connections" was approved by Government in March 2002 covering the three-year period from 2003 to 2005. In addition to e-government and e-business, the new action plan identifies opportunities in the areas of lifelong learning and e-inclusion, which strives to bridge the digital divide in addressing issues of disadvantage and exclusion.In response to the first action plan, my Department established a dedicated funding mechanism in 2000, the Information Society Fund, designed to support the implementation of e-government and e-business flagship projects identified in the action plan and to encourage Departments and bodies under their aegis, to respond to the information society agenda. An overall amount of €138.7 million was allocated under the fund over the period from 2000 to 2002. While consideration is currently being given to the size and distribution of funding over the period of the new action plan from 2003 to 2005, an overall amount of €42.9 million has been included in the Abridged Estimates Volume 2003 for information society projects.An evaluation team chaired by my Department and including representatives from the information society policy development unit of the Department of the Taoiseach approves projects under the fund. A total of 135 programmes and projects at an overall cost of €118.6 million have been approved for funding since the introduction of the fund in 2000.The majority of projects approved under the fund relate to e-government services some of which are already available to the general public and to businesses on the Internet. Examples of these services include: the Revenue on-line service, ROS, providing for the electronic filing of tax returns; on-line driving test application system; the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission's on-line recruitment service; the Land Registry on-line electronic search service for property folios; on-line access to public library catalogues; an e-procurement website advertising all public contracts and providing for the downloading of tender documents; OASIS, providing information for citizens based on life-events; BASIS, providing information for businesses based on business-episodes.The e-government projects under development include: e-cabinet, designed to support the Government process; e-legislation, providing a collaborative environment for bill drafting; on-line driving licence application; on-line motor tax renewal; on-line services for farmers coordinated by Teagasc; on-line exploration and mining licence application.The introduction of e-government services will accelerate with the introduction of the public services broker planned for mid-2003 and which is also being supported by the information society fund. The public services broker is being implemented by the Reach agency and will provide a single electronic gateway to Government services and public information.

The scheme provided for accelerated capital allowances and double rent relief for lessees of qualified buildings. The scheme was queried by the European Commission under state aid rules and the approval granted by the Commission in 1998 imposed certain specific conditions. The qualifying period was required to end on 31 December 1999 in order to conform with the end of the existing general regional aid framework throughout the European Union. The Commission ruled out the awarding of double rent relief in respect of any of the proposed enterprise areas adjacent to the regional airports. The Commission also requested the Irish authorities to submit details of individual airport projects to the Commission for separate approval by it. The proposal in relation to a cargo handling operation at Knock Airport was approved by the Commission on 26 October 1999 shortly before the expiry date for the scheme of 31 December 1999.New designation of a business park at Knock Airport could not take place in isolation but would need to be undertaken as part of a general scheme of designation for regional business parks and would have to be made available in other areas of need apart from Knock. Such a scheme would have to be undertaken in the context of objective criteria, which would justify the selectivity of any areas designated. Apart from this, the scheme would need to be submitted to the European Commission for approval under state aid rules. Recent experience of a much more rigorous examination of fiscal state aids by the Commission indicates that approval for any such scheme could not be guaranteed. In the recent budget, I confirmed the termination dates for a range of incentive schemes including the urban renewal, rural renewal and park and ride schemes. This announcement was made in the context of the general policy of broadening the tax base in an effort to keep the current low rates of income and personal taxation. For all of these reasons, I have no plans at present for the introduction of such a scheme of designation for regional business parks.

The actual rates of allowances payable from time to time are determined in accordance with agreed recommendations made by the general council under the scheme for conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. While not directly applicable to public servants outside the Civil Service, the provisions of Circular 11/82 underpin the determination of entitlements of travel and subsistence payments for many non-industrial staff throughout the public service.Most industrial civil servants, including those employed by Dúchas, are covered by the travel and subsistence provisions applicable to State industrial employees, which differ in a number of respects from those, which apply to general Civil Service grades referred to above. Amendments to the provisions or changes in rates of payment for industrial staff would be a matter for discussions under the auspices of the Joint Industrial Council for State Employees.

In the Finance Bill currently before the Dáil, I propose extending the current tax exemptions for these bodies, to apply also for capital gains tax to the extent that its income is exempt from income tax or, as the case may be, corporation tax. This will amount to generous tax treatment for such bodies. I have no plans to extend further exemptions from tax to such bodies beyond those before the House in the current Finance Bill.

It was agreed with the Civil Service unions that Special Olympics' volunteers may accumulate a maximum of five days flexi-leave. This arrangement will allow civil servants to volunteer for the event without losing any pay. This arrangement is a once off concession in recognition of this unique event. In addition, officers may avail of the ability to take additional special leave without pay if they wish to give more time to the event.My Department receives many applications for special leave from civil servants for numerous praiseworthy and meritorious non-official purposes. Generally, because of the potential cost to the Exchequer and the potential impact on service provision, special leave without pay is given. As Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the conditions of service of civil servants only. Arrangements for public servants are matters for the organisations in which they work.

The date of disposal is normally the date when the contract is made. However, where the contract is conditional, it is the date on which the condition is satisfied. I have also made provision in the Finance Bill 2003 so that even when the disposal took place on or after 4 December 2002, the gain can still be deferred where the reinvestment in certain linked assets took place before 4 December 2002, but within the timeframe allowed by the existing legislation. Therefore, the eligibility to rollover relief of landowners in the areas referred to by the Deputy will depend on the facts of the individual cases, which will be decided upon by the Revenue Commissioners.

The report noted that my Department had already identified the savings necessary to reach the pre-budget 2003 target for my Department's Vote. The report's only proposal in relation to my Department's Vote was that the allocation in it for the change management fund be reduced by €2 million. This proposal was implemented.In its summary of conclusions, the report recommended that my Department should undertake a medium term review of expenditure and should, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, formulate proposals for better control of numbers and administrative costs. A medium term review of expenditure will be conducted this year by my Department, while the Deputy will be aware that in budget 2003, I announced that the Government had decided that numbers employed across all sectors of the public service were to be capped with immediate effect and there would be a reduction of 5,000 in those numbers over the next three years.

After much investigation and consideration of a number of schemes, a preferred option was chosen in conjunction with the council and the corporation and the proposed scheme was brought to public exhibition in July 1999, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts, based on outline design only and prior to detailed design and tenders being sought.It was estimated at outline design that the scheme would cost €13.8 million. Following detailed design, there were some changes to the design of the riverside walls and this, as well as increased construction costs and a major increase in archaeological costs, reflecting the importance of Kilkenny as a major medieval city, meant that the cost of the project, sanctioned in June 2001 by the Department of Finance, was €34.8 million. Approximately €17 million has been spent on the scheme to date and it is expected that the full budget for the project will be spent.The Office of Public Works is currently meeting the Environmental Protection Agency to agree the scope of testing of spoil removed from the river. It is hoped to have agreement very shortly, after which an estimate of costs will be completed.

As Minister for Finance, my Department is responsible for the direct allocation and spending of funds under the technical assistance operational programme, the peace programme and the technical assistance measure in the regional operational programmes.The technical assistance operational programme and technical assistance measure under the southern and eastern regional operational programme are the only areas of NDP expenditure for which my Department is responsible in the southern and eastern regional assembly area. This expenditure is not allocated on a county basis. Between January and the end of June 2002, the most recent figures reported to the monitoring committees, expenditure under the technical assistance OP and technical assistance measure in the southern and eastern regional OP was €957,000 and €49,000 respectively. The complete expenditure figures for 2002 will be reported to the monitoring committees in March.

As regards the impact of the change in the rate on new housing, generally the purchase of a house involves two stages, namely, the payment of a deposit at the time of signing the contract, with the possibility of staged payments as the house is being constructed and payment of the balance on completion. Where a payment is received from a private individual and any other person not registered for VAT, the rate of VAT applicable is the rate in force at the time the payment is received. Therefore, any payment made during 2002 was liable at the 12.5% rate, and payments made during 2003 are liable at the 13.5% rate.Thus, in cases where deposits and-or staged payments were made prior to 1 January 2003, it is on the remaining balance that the increased rate is applied. In cases where contracts are signed, but no payments made prior to 1 January 2003, the total cost of construction of the house is subject to VAT at 13.5%.

On 12 February 2003, he was convicted on six counts and sentenced to a minimum of five years imprisonment, with a maximum of five years and one day. The remaining three counts of armed and masked robbery have not yet been tried in the courts. I understand the person's attorney will meet the prosecutor and presiding judge in April to discuss a resolution of these matters.The consulate general in Boston has been providing consular assistance to this person since his arrest and has been in contact with him on a number of occasions. The vice-consul met with the person's mother and sister in February 2002 and visited him in prison on 9 February 2003 to discuss his case. The vice-consul has also been in regular contact with the person's attorneys.Once all charges have been dealt with, the person will be in a position to apply for a transfer to Ireland under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The consulate general will continue to monitor the case and to provide all possible consular assistance.

It is a matter of profound regret that the people of Iraq continue to suffer considerable hardship as a result of their Government's deliberate and persistent violation of successive UN Security Council resolutions aimed at preserving international peace and security. This has been and remains our consistent position. As I stated to the Dáil on 29 January:The people of Iraq have suffered as a consequence of UN sanctions. Some countries, including Ireland have striven with limited success to reduce the impact of these sanctions on the most vulnerable elements of society. The Iraqi authorities could have ensured the lifting of sanctions by co-operating with the inspectors. Instead, they sought to use the sanctions as a propaganda tool, disrupting revenue flows to the oil for food programme and failing to concentrate contracts on areas of greatest humanitarian need.UN Security Council Resolution 1409, which was adopted in May 2002, places the operation of sanctions on a new basis. It seeks to target sanctions against the Iraqi regime while minimising the impact of those sanctions on the civilian population. In particular, the provisions of Resolution 1409 were intended to ensure continuing availability of medical supplies for the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population, including mothers and children. Ireland played an active role in the development of this resolution.The Government wants to see circumstances brought about which would permit the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq altogether. Those circumstances do not currently exist. Until such time as those circumstances arise, the application of a targeted sanctions regime, as set out in Resolution 1409, is the best means of ensuring that the primacy of the Security Council Resolutions is respected and humanitarian concerns are addressed.The fact remains, however, that the most effective way of easing the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people and avoiding any escalation in the current situation would be for the Iraqi Government to act immediately to meet its obligations under the UN Charter by complying fully with the demands placed upon it by the Security Council.

Generally, eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates, are EU nationals or hold official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course.In addition, my Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or post-graduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. Candidates who hold European Union nationality, official refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State are eligible under the nationality requirement of the schemes.Maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of grant is payable where the grant holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of grant is payable in all other cases. The full rate of adjacent and non-adjacent grant for the current academic year is €2,510 and €1,004 respectively.Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college.

Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia, the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme, specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia and a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.In addition to the above measures, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and deliverance of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties.

This plan is currently being examined in my Department.My Department's special education section will liaise directly with the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy so that an appropriate placement may be arranged.

An interim governing authority was established to oversee the development of the academy in April 2002.In light of a lack of available capital funding in 2003 to progress the capital elements of the project, the Government has reconsidered its approach to the development of an Irish academy for the performing arts. The Government has now decided to transfer responsibility for the project to the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and has agreed that other options for the development of an Irish academy for the performing arts in tandem with projects of a similar nature will now be considered. In the circumstances, the members of the interim governing authority have been requested to stand down. The authority met on four occasions in April, July, October and December 2002. Some €68,475 was spent on the project from the establishment of the authority to date. No formal published reports were issued by the authority during its lifetime. The activities undertaken included: an ongoing process of fact finding and research towards the development of the academy's future direction which saw: presentations from representatives of the three proposed nodes (music, drama and dance) of the academy and on-site visits to each nodal centre were also being planned; a presentation by Dr. Danny O'Hare who chaired the planning and steering group for the academy; and a presentation from the rector of the Sibelius Academy in Finland as an example of best practice abroad. Other similar presentations were planned for future meetings, for example from the heads of the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts and the Juilliard School in the US.

These programmes are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. My Department is also responsible for a number of measures under the regional operational programmes for the border, midlands and western region (BMW) and the southern and eastern region (S&E).Expenditure under the operational and regional programmes is monitored by monitoring committees that have been established for each of the programmes. This expenditure is reported at NUTS II level (that is, BMW and S&E basis) and it is available at county level. Expenditure under the four programmes for the full year 2002 will be reviewed at the spring monitoring committee meetings that will be held in April 2003.Regarding the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the Waterford constituency, due to the wide range of programmes under the NDP in the education sector, it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the question in the detail requested. However, if the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific measure, I will be happy to seek to obtain the information for him.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	685	There are no plans to change the status of Waterford Institute of Technology. My Department, however, continues to work with Waterford Institute of Technology in developing and upgrading the Institute.In July 1996, the Government approved in principle, the recommendations in the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the southeast region. The committee's report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation rate in degree programmes.The Government accepted these recommendations. The provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses, in Waterford Institute of Technology, has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. In this regard, figures supplied to my Department by Waterford Institute of Technology indicate that in the region of 40% of students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses are enrolled on courses at degree and postgraduate levels. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college provide the necessary status and capacity for the Institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach, WIT is among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	687	In June 1999, the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This initiative was extended by a further 59 schools in June 2000. The selection of schools was based on an objective analysis of their retention rates. Accordingly schools with the most significant difficulties were invited to participate in the initiative. This allowed resources to be targeted at schools through which they would reach the greatest number of young people at risk.In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme or SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and will assimilate the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and stay-in-school retention initiative at second level or SSRI.The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. Based on this analysis and having regard to the funding available, 82 project sites were selected. The projects selected to participate in the school completion programme comprised 65 new projects, which included 64 SSRI schools in addition to the 17 existing ESLI projects. The remaining 53 SSRI schools, which were not selected to participate in this project strand, will continue to be funded under the SSRI strand of this programme up to 31 August 2005.

Before large-scale projects are allowed to proceed to tender, an analysis of the cost of each project is undertaken to ensure value for money.The NDP has not yet reached the half way stage of its life span. The vast bulk of major capital schools projects being delivered under the NDP are ongoing, as evidenced in the recently published 2003 programme of works which includes over 200 large scale projects either at construction or authorised to proceed to construction or where payments are outstanding. In the circumstances, the detailed information sought by the Deputy in regard to these projects is not yet available.If the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific project, I will be happy to seek to obtain the information for him.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	691	In 2000 my Department engaged consultants to carry out an assessment of the capability of the existing infrastructure and on-shore facilities at Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre to service safely and efficiently the existing and future requirements of the fishing industry and other potential sources of commercial traffic. The report recommended two separate but complimentary developments at the harbour, namely the provision of a dedicated ferry berth and the provision of a deep water berth, with facilities for vessels up to eight metres draught. The overall cost of such developments was estimated at €30 million.In 2001 and 2002, a total of €2.7 million was spent on works in relation to the Rossaveal Fishery Harbour Centre development. The Exchequer funding available to my Department in 2003 does not provide for further funding of the Rossaveal development at this time. As the Deputy will appreciate, there are a considerable number of pressing proposals for fishery harbour developments which require ongoing consideration. The question of advancing either of the Rossaveal developments will therefore have to be considered in the light of the Exchequer funding available going forward and the national priorities to be addressed.

Six nation-wide training courses relating to this scheme were organised by my Department in 2002, with approximately 300 people in attendance.The Government recently made difficult choices in the area of the public finances. In making these decisions, the Government was not in a position to make as much money available as it would have liked for all programmes across the whole range of public expenditure. My colleague Deputy Browne, the Minister of State, has been in regular contact with the forestry stakeholders and a decision is imminent on the funding for such schemes in 2003.

In accordance with this provision, an operator designated to meet universal service obligations must meet all reasonable requests for connection to the fixed public telephone network.The Commission for Communications Regulation, in accordance these regulations, is responsible for the designation of the universal service provider and ensuring the universal service provider complies with its obligations, including determination of the reasonableness of requests. Eircom has been designated by the commission as the universal service provider in the State.The legislative framework on universal service provision in the telecommunication market has been in place since before the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and is not affected by it.As regards the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have no function in the matter. If the universal service provider is inhibited from meeting its obligations by planning considerations, it would be a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation to determine whether any refusal to supply was reasonable.

The fisheries boards are preparing a profile of expenditure, which will ensure adherence to the 2003 allocation. The specific allocation of funding to the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board will be determined in the context of this profile.The employment of contract staff in 2003 will be a matter for the board to determine when deciding their staffing complement for the year in the context of available funding and having regard to Department of Finance guidelines on recruitment to the public service generally.

In particular, it is a requirement that such measures are capable of depriving those responsible of the economic benefit of infringements, produce results proportionate to the seriousness of such infringements and also discourage further infringements of the same kind.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	699	Under national fleet policy which derives from legal EU obligations, fishing vessels with refrigerated seawater (RSW) tanks have been confined to the dedicated pelagic segment of the fishing fleet. The introduction of new RSW tank boats to the pelagic segment requires 100% replacement capacity.Applications were received in 1999 and 2000 to introduce RSW tank boats into the multi-purpose whitefish segment in order to fish for herring and mackerel. Given fundamental policy and technical implications, the conditions of licences granted to these applicants required the prior de-commissioning of the RSW tanks. The applicants accepted licences with the precondition.Pending a review of licensing policy and all other relevant considerations, a moratorium on the introduction of vessels with tanks (either functioning or non functioning) into the whitefish fleet was put in place in February 2001. The review of licensing policy is under way and a report of the review group is expected in June.Grant aid under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for fleet renewal has been focused on enhancing the operational efficiency, competitiveness and safety of the whitefish fleet and has not been made available towards the introduction of capacity into the fleet primarily targeting pelagic species. As most of the available funding for fleet renewal has already been committed and as current EU policy links future funding of fleet renewal with fleet cuts and ceases altogether at the end of 2004, it is not anticipated that grant aid will be made available for fleet renewal in the future.

This meeting was attended by a member of the Belmullet Sea Angling Club representing the Connacht Provincial Council of the IFSA.I appreciate the concerns of the Belmullet Sea Angling Club regarding the possible effects the new regulations may have on sea angling festivals and competitions, particularly where there may be difficulties in bringing old fishing vessels up to the required safety standard. However, as Minister, my primary concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waterways. While sea angling festivals are of importance in tourism terms we cannot build our tourism industry on poor safety regime. There is a long-term benefit to the tourism industry in being able to demonstrate that the highest safety standards are adhered to in sea angling and I would urge sea angling clubs and festival organisers to avail of the boats that are already licensed.To facilitate boat owners affected by the new regulations my Department held five information seminars at different locations around the country last October. Furthermore, in response to a request from the Connacht provincial council of the IFSA, an additional seminar will be held in Mayo next month and officials of the maritime safety directorate of my Department will be in contact with the IFSA shortly to finalise arrangements.

Notices were placed in the national press and the Official Journal of the European Community. Local authorities were all notified directly by post. All members of the Oireachtas were notified directly, as were chambers of commerce, all county enterprise boards, IBEC, leader groups and development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Forfás, who organised a series of workshops around the country. Closing date for receipt of tenders was 19 October 2001. Following evaluation of the tenders, 19 towns were selected for the construction of metropolitan area networks.

The first stage of the process will be a review of the existing sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme, the results of which will feed into the formulation of a long-term strategy for the development of sporting facilities by an inter-agency steering group to be set up in the near future.One of the first tasks of this inter-agency steering group will be to oversee the national audit of local sports facilities. This will entail establishing the parameters of such an audit in relation to the standard, size and type of facilities to be recorded and to decide upon the best way to gather this information. It will also need to consider how this information on existing facilities can be most effectively used in the assessment of applications for national lottery grants in conjunction with other factors such as current and future population demographics and the diverse needs of a wide range of sports. Carrying out an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major and complex undertaking and is likely to take a substantial amount of time and resources to complete.

In the case of tourism, the recommendation of a cut of €5 million – effectively in tourism marketing funding – was not implemented by my Department due to the Government's commitment to support this most valuable sector of our economy at this difficult time, as reaffirmed by the Government's decision to increase the 2003 budget for tourism marketing to €30.4 million. Furthermore, any consideration of the committee's suggested changes for increased industry contributions to the activities of the marketing and development bodies, and greater cooperation between the various tourism agencies will have to await the outcome of the tourism policy review and the establishment of the new National Tourism Development Authority.

The productive sector OP provides funding to Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Ltd. in respect of tourism marketing and funding to Bord Scannán na hÉireann in respect of capital grants. Funding in respect of tourism training is provided to CERT and to Bord Scannán na hÉireann for film training, through the employment and human resources OP. Because of the nature of these two programmes, it is not possible to apportion funding on a county basis. However, I understand that CERT spent €1.7 million in Waterford last year on training for 271 people on unemployed, industry and college-based programmes.National development plan funding for tourism product development purposes is channelled through the tourism measures of the local enterprise development priority of the BMW and S&E regional operational programmes. The commencement of these measures was delayed because of the need to obtain state aids approval from the EU and, as a result, no expenditure took place under this measure in either OP in 2002. National development plan funding in respect of sports facilities falls under the culture, recreation and sports measures of the local infrastructure priority of the BMW and S&E regional OPs. Implementation of these measures could not commence until the national spatial strategy was published. Publication of the strategy occurred in December 2002 and, therefore, no expenditure under the sports facilities programme was incurred in 2002.No expenditure took place in 2002 in County Waterford in relation to the arts and culture facilities sub-measure of the culture recreation and sports measures of the local infrastructure priority of both regional OPs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	716	Health boards have an obligation to comply with all statutory and local authority regulations regarding the disposing of waste from hospitals and other institutions and I would expect them to meet their obligations in this regard. In 1994, my Department issued a health services waste policy to all health boards and acute voluntary hospitals. The policy advocated good environmental and health and safety practices in the management, handling and disposal of all wastes generated in hospitals. Central to this policy were the segre gation of health care waste into risk waste and non-risk waste and the initiation of a national contract to deal with the health care risk waste.A national contract has been in operation for the past three years for the collection and treatment of health care risk waste by alternative technology. The facilities used are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency. All acute hospitals now have their healthcare risk waste treated and disposed of in this manner. These arrangements are working satisfactorily. The non-risk hospital waste, which is largely domestic in nature, is disposed of by the municipal or commercial waste disposal route. A detailed guidance document was issued in 1999 on the segregation, packaging and storage of health care risk waste. This latter document has been up-dated and issued recently in the light of recent regulatory changes relating to the transportation and carriage of such materials.In the wake of recent reports of alleged instances of illegal dumping of waste, some of which was stated to be hospital waste, my Department wrote to the health agencies, drawing attention to the guidelines and stressing the importance of ensuring that reputable waste contractors are employed and that proof of disposal to licensed landfill site is obtained for each load of non-risk waste. The contractors operate under permits issued by the local waste authorities.

Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The  target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end November 2002, 106,585 women had been called for screening and 79,906 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%.I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck. Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50-64 age bracket in Counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually. In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid west and north west. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	724	The estimated cost of the most recent national anti-smoking campaign is approximately €2 million per year.Smoking has been the largest single issue focused upon by the health promotion unit of my Department. The national Break the Habit campaign was developed in partnership with my Department, the Irish Cancer Society and the regional health boards. This campaign targets the whole population to encourage smokers to stop smoking and non-smokers not to start by emphasising the positive effects quitting smoking can have on the individual. In response to a national survey indicating the increased prevalence of smoking among teenagers, a special component of the Break the Habit campaign was developed during 2000 to target teenagers. This campaign called NICO concentrates on the simple message that smokers are less attractive than non-smokers.In addition to the anti-smoking campaign my Department has funded, through the cardiovascular health strategy, a number of initiatives to reduce the incidence of smoking. An additional 26 smoking cessation officers have been recruited by the health boards. This enables the boards to increase support to individuals to quit smoking and to provide advice regarding smoking policies and legislation.In April 2001 nicotine replacement therapy was made available to all medical cardholders who smoke. From the launch of nicotine replacement therapy in April 2001 to October 2002, 115,355 prescriptions have been issued to medical cardholders at a total cost of about €4.2 million.Following the signature by the President of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 on 27 March 2002, I established the Office of Tobacco Control on a statutory basis. This indicates my commitment to a range of anti-smoking measures. In this regard, I announced, on 30 January last, my intention to ban smoking in all workplaces from 1 January 2004. This ban will include the hospitality industry where many workers are exposed to passive smoking.As Minister for Health and Children I see it as a major priority for me to put in place innovative and effective smoking cessation interventions at national and regional level in order to reduce the incidence of smoking related diseases in this country.

At that time, the chief executive officers of the health boards took a collective decision not to engage family members and relatives as paid home helps. This was in recognition of the fact that the initiative was not intended to replace the existing informal arrangements whereby family members and relatives provided assistance in the tasks of daily living to many old people living at home. Legally, family members are not debarred from acting as home helps but the practice has been that they provided support to older relatives, without payment. There have, I understand, been some instances where a distant relative, for example, a cousin, has been employed as a home help but these have been in exceptional circumstances. I again emphasise that the operation of the home help scheme is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards.

Persons who suffer from any of these illnesses may apply to their local health board for admission to the long-term illness scheme. There is no  appeal system in place for persons whose illness is not included in the list of illnesses covered by the long-term illness scheme.Myasthenia Gravis is not one of the illnesses covered by the terms of the long-term illness scheme.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. An applicant who is refused a medical card may appeal the decision to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

The treatment of cancer, including prostate cancer often takes place over a period of time and may involve a combination of treatments.Since 1997, approximately €400 million has been specifically targeted for the development of cancer services under the national cancer strategy. An additional sum of €29 million was allocated in 2003 for cancer services. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, general surgery, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the National Cancer Strategy 2003 is being developed by the national cancer forum in conjunction with my Department and will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. The new strategy will also address other issues, including mechanisms for collating data on waiting lists and times for the various modalities of cancer treatment. At present, data on waiting times specifically for prostate cancer services are not routinely collected by my Department

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	746	As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the  National Breast Screening Programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end November 2002, 106,585 women had been called for screening and 79,906 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 75%.I recently announced the extension of BreastCheck to a further three counties. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck.Approximately, 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow will be invited for screening. Approximately 9,500 per annum will be invited once the programme is fully operational in these counties. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually.In relation to the further expansion of the programme, the board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department. Two static units are proposed in host hospitals, one in Cork and the other in Galway at which breast surgery would be performed for women in the south, west, mid-west and north west.A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.

The authority informs me that not all of the beds available in private nursing homes are suitable for patients being discharged from acute hospitals because of their location or because of their inability to meet the nursing and care needs of such patients.At present the three area health boards in the Eastern Region are fully or partially subventing a total of 3,001 beds in private nursing homes. Of these there are 1,589 beds partially subvented and 1,412 beds fully subvented.For example, this year the Eastern Regional Health Authority is spending approximately €45 million on subvented private nursing homes beds.Extended care is provided in long-stay units and welfare homes throughout the Eastern Region. There are over 2,200 beds in public and voluntary hospitals and homes across the region.The ERHA, in conjunction with their three area health boards and the voluntary hospitals in the region, has introduced a scheme whereby 24 hour packages of care are put in place to enable people who would otherwise have to go to nursing homes to return home.

It was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives. However, following correspondence and discussions with EU Commission officials on this matter and having obtained legal advice from the Attorney General it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty as to the enforceability of sections in question.The challenge to the Act in the courts by the tobacco industry comprised three sets of proceedings. In one of these cases no order for costs was made. In the other two cases an order for the State defendants to pay the legal costs was made. The precise amount of legal costs payable will be determined by the Taxing Master of the High Court upon a claim being made by the plaintiffs. In addition, the State will be responsible for its own legal costs.

Following this report, my Department has implemented various measures which address the committee's proposals.Regional AirportsAn expenditure review of the public service obligations, PSO, air service programme will be carried out by my Department to evaluate the effectiveness of current PSO arrangements and to examine the scope for alternative policy approaches to achieving the objectives on a more efficient and effective basis. Tenders for the carrying out of this assignment are currently being evaluated and it is hoped to award the relevant contract by the end of the month. This review is expected to be completed during the month of April.Taxi Hardship PaymentsThe Government is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. On 17 December 2002 the Government approved the publication of the report of the taxi hardship panel and the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the panel by the National Taxi Regulator. On 14 February 2003, I announced the appointment of Mr. Jimmy Farrelly as interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation pending the introduction later this year of a Commission for Taxi Regulation on a full statutory basis. I have asked Mr. Farrelly to examine how best the findings of the taxi hardship panel can be implemented.CIEI approved an increase of an average of 9% in CIE fares with effect from 2 December 2002. I have also made provision for the Railway Safety Commission from within the overall 2003 allocations thus continuing to maintain the Government's commitment to rail safety.The measures outlined in the Review of Estimates Report will, of course, require ongoing consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

For example, the relevant agreement to provide and operate the East link toll bridge is between NTR and Dublin City Council. The East link toll bridge, which opened in 1986, is a non-national road and is a matter for the Minister of the Environment and Local Government.The West link toll bridge, which opened in 1990, is operated by NTR. The relevant agreement to operate this toll bridge is between NTR and the NRA and provides for tolls being charged for a period of 30 years from the date of opening of the toll facility.An annual licence fee based on a percentage of the gross toll revenue, GTR, is payable to the Minister for Transport in respect of the West link Bridge. The Minister's share of gross toll revenue in respect of 2001 was €9.2 million.It is envisaged that a significant proportion of the national roads programme will be implemented by means of public-private partnerships, PPPs, which will involve private sector funding and will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. The NRA's current PPP programme comprises 11 high quality projects spread throughout the country.The M50 second West link Bridge is under construction and is expected to be completed this year. The funding arrangements are subject to the relevant tolling agreement between the NRA and NTR.The position in relation to the remaining PPP projects is as follows: the Kilcock-Kinnegad Project is at final negotiation stage; initial tendering has been completed and bidders have been shortlisted to proceed to the best and final offer stage in the case of both the N25 Waterford Bypass and the Dundalk Western Bypass; the N8 Rathcormac-Fermoy Bypass is at tender evaluation stage; the NRA has invited expressions of interest for the M3 Clonee to Kells; and the remaining five schemes are at an advanced design stage which includes the preparation of statutory documentation for publication.Funding arrangements for these schemes will not be determined until the relevant negotiations are finalised and tolling agreements entered into by the NRA.

They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee have free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.Qualified catering staff are attached to the various prisons and places of detention. In the course of their inspections of the catering areas, the visiting committees meet these staff. Where difficulties are highlighted or identified, the issues are raised by the committee with the local prison authorities or may be referred to me as is provided for under the legislation.The Deputy might wish to note that independent audits of prison catering services are conducted by CERT on an annual basis, the results of which are available to prison visiting committees. A number of prison institutions have been successful in obtaining the hygiene mark for their catering services, which is awarded by Excellence Ireland.

In this context, the board reviewed the operation of its private practitioner scheme and decided that priority should be given to domestic violence cases and that maintenance, custody and access cases would generally in future be referred to law centres, except where an applicant requires one of these remedies at the same time as a domestic violence remedy.The Deputy will be aware that the allocation of additional funding and resources to the Legal Aid Board in recent years, up from €10.656 million in 1997 to €17.075 million in 2003, has led to an increase in the services available from the board and to a significant reduction in waiting times.I can further inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. In 2001, the total number of priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 1,500, or about 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.I am informed that the board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.

However, each year, indicative average costs of keeping an offender in the various prisons and places of detention under the aegis of prisons and places of detention are released.The individuals referred to by the Deputy were transferred from Portlaoise Prison to Castlerea Prison on 4 May 2000. The cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise and Castlerea Prisons for the year 2000 was €157,828 and €63,233 respectively. The cost of a keeping a prisoner in Castlerea Prison in 2001 was €66,700. Figures are not yet available for 2002.As the Deputy is no doubt aware, legal proceedings taken in these cases have not been concluded and the question of costs has therefore not been determined.

With normal remission he is due for release on 10 June 2006.I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, am responsible for the management of this man's sentence and it would be inappropriate for me to offer any form of legal advice on the issues that he has raised in his correspondence. It is the case though, that this man has access to his legal representatives who can offer him assistance and appropriate advice. It is also the case that neither I nor my predecessors have ever engaged in direct correspondence with prisoners and I see no reason to divert from this practice in this instance.

This represented approximately 2.75% of total funds allocated by my Department under the NDP in 2002. However, it understates the actual position as a significant proportion of total funding is national and it is not possible to distribute it on a county by county basis as its impact is of an indirect nature.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I propose to take Questions Nos. 448 and 449 together.Peat extraction for domestic purposes in candidate special areas of conservation does not generally result in significant damage to the conservation value of the sites in the short-term. Arrangements announced in 1998 provided that domestic turf cutting in candidate SACs could be allowed to continue for up to ten years, save in exceptionally sensitive parts of the bogs, in order to give owners of turbary rights time to make new arrangements for alternative sources of supply. Similar arrangements are being considered for additional sites recently proposed for designation.Most damage to candidate SACs from peat extraction is caused by commercial and industrial operations. In order to maintain the conservation value of these sites, such damaging operations have stopped or are being phased out over as short a period as possible. Commercial operators must consult my Department's heritage service. Turf cutting is only permitted to continue in the short-term in exceptional circumstances to protect employment. Each case is assessed on an individual basis. If it is found that cutting must cease in order to protect a candidate SAC compensation will be paid for proven actual loss.Peat extraction in areas adjoining candidate SACs is not subject to direct control by my Department. It may require to be assessed in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 if liable to have an adverse effect on a candidate SAC.

Where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken. To date such funding has been provided to Dublin City Council under the following schemes: the remedial works scheme which assists local authorities in carrying out major essential works to dwellings in designated estates; the special area regeneration programme which consists of a once-off programme of upgrading high density older flat complexes; and the redevelopment of a number of seriously rundown flat complexes involving a mix of new building, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement.My Department has provided some €391 million to date for the above schemes including over €160 million for the major programme of regeneration of Ballymun. In addition the council has been undertaking a programme, funded from its own resources, to provide central heating in its older housing stock.Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock.Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings. The council has been advised to this effect.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	820	Article 4 of the Euro pean Directive on the conservation of wild birds (79/409/EEC) requires member states, including Ireland, to designate special protection areas for wild birds. Under the directive the selection of sites for designation is based on scientific criteria.My Department's heritage service is currently examining the suitability of nine upland areas for designation as SPAs in respect of the hen harrier. This is one species for which SPAs must be designated under the directive. Its breeding population is largely concentrated in the south west. The areas being examined include the Mullagherierk mountains, which are partly in west Limerick.Preparatory scientific work to assess the suitability of all nine sites and define their boundaries is currently under way. When this work is complete I will decide what sites should be formally proposed for designation. If any sites are formally proposed as SPAs then my Department will notify and consult landowners and land users in the area. A period of three months will be allowed for making objections.In general existing farming activities are likely to be fully compatible with the conservation requirements of hen harriers and other bird species for which SPAs are designated. In these circumstances there will be no need to place any restrictions on traditional farming activities. SPAs attract higher levels of payment to farmers who join the rural environment protection scheme which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I am committed to paying fair and reasonable compensation to other landowners for actual loss shown to have been incurred as a result of restrictions that may be imposed on existing activities consequent on designation of their lands.In relation to the planning process, planning authorities are required to provide in their development plans for the appropriate protection of nature conservation areas, including SPAs. In particular, they must consider whether a development is likely to have a significant effect on an SPA, and if so, to require an environmental impact assessment to be carried out.

These authorities will take funding issues into account in future budgetary plans.Dublin City Council has made considerable progress to date in noise mapping. It published noise mapping project Dublin city – interim report in September 2002. This linked land use, population density and traffic data for the area between the Royal and Grand Canals. The council has advised me that the next phase of the project, which involves mapping the area from the North and South Circular Roads to the city council boundary, is scheduled for publication by the end of the year.

Copies of the bulletin are available in the Oireachtas Library. At present figures for 2002 are being compiled and will be published, in due course, in the 2002 annual bulletin.As the administration of the disabled persons grants scheme, including the process of application and sanctioning of the grant, is a matter for local authorities, information regarding the length of time taken to process an application from receipt to approval stage is not available in my Department. Notification of capital allocations for the scheme in 2003 will issue as soon as all authorities have submitted their expenditure outturns for 2002 and estimates for 2003.The operation of the disabled persons grant scheme is currently being reviewed in my Department.

The question of providing core funding to new groups, including the group referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of existing commitments and available resources. I anticipate that decisions relating to the expansion of the programme during 2003 will be made in the very near future.My Department will be in contact with the group when a decision has been made.

Assuming that an acceptable tender is received for the joint project and that all other requirements are in place, it should be possible to have a contractor appointed by mid-summer with a view to having work commenced in early autumn.

It has now been agreed that my Department will be responsible for the further advancement of the necessary works to the pier at Blacksod. It is anticipated that the project, which involves the extension of the pier, will be completed by Mayo County Council in 2003 under my Department's scheme for the development of strategic Gaeltacht harbours. The cost of the works will not be known until the tendering process has been completed by the council. Funding has been provided in my Department's Estimates for the development of strategic Gaeltacht piers. Blacksod pier has been identified as appropriate for such development subject to all other requirements being in place.The provision of marine leisure facilities does not come within the remit of my Department's scheme and is not proposed as part of the present development at Blacksod.

This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of €2.03 million with the council to provide the balance of €0.19 million.It was hoped that construction of the cablecar would have commenced in 2002 and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of this year. A delay has occurred as a result of an objection lodged with An Bord Pleanála last year against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of the land required for the project. While An Bord Pleanála subsequently confirmed the said CPOs, this decision is currently the subject of a judicial review which is listed to be heard in the High Court on 31 March. Efforts to resolve this issue by solicitors representing the local family and the council have proved unsuccessful to date. The Deputy will appreciate that the project cannot be progressed any further pending resolution of this issue.

At the meeting – at which the Deputy was present – I was made aware of their views of the RAPID programme and the time and commitment they have invested in it to date.Under the programme each area implementation team prepared a plan for their area. These plans contained a wide range of proposals with very varied timescales and costs. My Department's role, supported by Area Development Management Limited, is to co-ordinate the implementation of the programme. It is a matter for Departments to report on progress in relation to implementing RAPID proposals that fall within the remit of their areas.It is important at this stage to restate that the Government remains committed to the RAPID programme and its implementation. My officials have had a number of bilateral meetings with other relevant Departments in recent months to advance its implementation. I hope to meet my ministerial colleagues in other Departments in the coming weeks to discuss a number of options as to how the plans might be further advanced.

He does not qualify for this pension as he fails to satisfy the statutory condition requiring him to have at least 260 full rate contributions paid since first entering insurance. According to my Department's records he has a total of 226 full rate contributions paid since he entered insurance in 1955. This condition also needs to be satisfied to qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66.In addition to not having the required minimum number of paid contributions, the person concerned also fails to satisfy the qualifying condition requiring him to have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions paid or credited over the period from January 1955 to December 2002. According to my Department's records he has a yearly average of 11 over this period. The person concerned was notified of the decision on his retirement pension claim on 28 January 2003.As the person concerned was also insurably employed in England details of his UK insurance record have been requested from the UK social security authorities. On receipt of this information his entitlement to an EU pro rata retirement pension will be examined and he will be notified of the position.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

The allowance is payable as an increase to the personal rate of pension. In order to be entitled to it a person must have an underlying entitlement to a personal rate of pension in their own right.Any proposals to change the current arrangements for payment of the allowance would have expenditure implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.

Money provided by family members by way of a private loan, which must be repaid, is assessed and treated as a capital lump sum for assessment purposes.In the assessment of capital the first €12,697 is disregarded and only amounts over that figure are assessable. Where part or all of the moneys received by way of a private loan are disposed of the value of that amount is excluded from the capital assessment.In a situation where a person receives regular cash contributions from any source as a way of supplementing his or her income the full amount of the contributions is assessed.

She was awarded payment at a reduced rate based on a weekly means of €89 derived from income from her husband's self-employment.She appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and an oral hearing was held on 4 November 2002. After the hearing the appeals officer deferred his decision to enable the person to furnish additional evidence in support of her appeal. Nothing further was submitted. On 3 January the appeals officer determined that €89 per week is the appropriate rate. This entitles the person to a weekly unemployment assistance rate of €80.80.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

In 2000 and 2001, the minimum amount payable was £20, equivalent to €25.40, and in 2002 the minimum payment was increased to €30.The bonus is intended for long-term welfare payment recipients, including recipients of retirement, old age contributory and non-contributory, widow's, widower's and invalidity pensions, one parent family payment, carer's allowance, disability allowance, long-term unemployment assistance, farm assist and employment support payments. Recipients are only entitled to one such bonus.In addition to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, the bonus is also paid to persons participating in FÁS, VTOS, Job Initiative and community employment schemes, and to recipients of certain health board payments such as domiciliary care allowance, blind welfare allowance and mobility allowance.In general a person cannot receive more than one payment and the question of double payment of bonus would only arise in limited circumstances where a person is in receipt of a social welfare payment and payment also under an employment support scheme.The total cost of the Christmas bonus in 2002 was an estimated €103.3 million. It benefited some 792,000 recipients and an estimated 413,000 dependants.Expenditure on the bonus payment to recipients of non-social welfare employment and income supports as outlined above, is provided for in the Votes of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science, and Health and Children.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	848	The report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee to the Minister for Finance, published in December 2002, made a number of specific recommendations in relation to my Department's proposed 2003 Estimates. They were as follows: a reduction in the amount sought by my Department for administrative expenses; a phasing out of the back to work allowance and a discontinuation of summer payments in respect of the back to education allowance schemes; a speeding up of the implementation of the employment action plan whereby persons on the live register are offered supports to find employment or training; changes to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme; a reduction in the financial allocations sought to fund the money advice and budgeting service and the Family Support Agency; and greater control savings across schemes.In the light of the recommendations by the committee on administration expenses, measures have been put in place to reduce expenditure on administration while maintaining the focus on high priority areas.In relation to the BTWA scheme, it was decided not to share out the scheme but to refocus it on those who were on the live register for five years or more and on other groups who had particular difficulty in accessing the labour market such as those on disability or invalidity payments. Persons who were in receipt of the BTWA prior to January are not affected by the introduction of the new arrangements.In line with the committee's recommendation, summer payments under the BTEA scheme will be discontinued this year.

In the circumstances my Department does not have the details of employment in other member states of the EU to give the information requested by the Deputy. As he is resident in England, the Department of Social Security has now been requested to forward the necessary details. When they are received his entitlement to an EU pro rata pension will be examined and he will be advised of the position in due course.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	851	To qualify for unemployment benefit a person must sustain a substantial loss of employment. In order to satisfy this condition the number of days worked in any week must be less than the number of days normally worked in a representative period prior to the date of claim.The person concerned made an application for unemployment benefit on 23 January. Her employer has been requested to provide details of her pattern of employment in the 52 weeks prior to the date of her claim. On receipt of this information a decision will be made on her unemployment benefit claim as soon as possible and she will be notified of the outcome.The person concerned was also advised to apply for unemployment assistance. A deciding officer disallowed her unemployment assistance claim on the grounds that her means exceed the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable in her case.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	852	Since the inception of the free travel scheme, there have been peak time restrictions on free travel services on Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann provincial city services in Cork and Limerick. These restrictions arise because of pressure on bus capacity at peak commuter times.If a free travel passholder wishes to depart from Dublin, Cork or Limerick on a Bus Éireann long distance service on a Friday in the peak period between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. he or she would be charged a fare for the first 20 miles of the journey. The remainder of the journey is free. Similarly, he or she would be required to pay a fare if they used Dublin Bus services at peak times.The restrictions do not apply in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.The free travel scheme was introduced, inter alia, to utilise spare off-peak capacity on public transport services. Any general lifting of the time restrictions for free travel passholders could cause significant extra capacity problems for urban transport operators and for other commuters. This issue is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for wider access by passholders where circumstances allow.

She appealed the disallowance and was examined by a medical assessor of my Department on 15 January. The medical assessor expressed the opinion that the person concerned was not qualified for disability allowance which is a long-term payment but remains incapable of work.Her insurance record qualifies her for disability benefit from 6 January. Due to an administrative error payment of disability benefit was discontinued from 24 January. That error is regretted. Payment has since been restored and all payment due to 10 February, the date of the latest medical certificate, has been issued.

The person concerned is in receipt of one-parent family payment at the rate of €134.10 per week.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department, also provides assistance to people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. People in full-time education are generally excluded from receiving assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. They may apply under the scheme for exceptional needs payments in respect of certain expenses such as cots, buggies and other child care requisites. Payments under these provisions of the scheme have been made in the case in question.

Examples of which are as follows: social welfare spending will have risen by over €4.5 billion in the period between 1997 and 2003 – well in excess of the rate of inflation; payments rates for both recipients and their families have improved very considerably in real terms; there has been a major increase in the level of resources devoted to child benefit; and significant structural improvements have been made to the social welfare system.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	858	The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of €85.80.Following a review of the person's entitlement he was assessed with means of €71 per week derived from income from his father's farm. His rate of unemployment assistance was revised to €53.80 with effect from 1 January.The person concerned has appealed against this decision and the necessary papers are being prepared. When this is complete the case will be referred to an appeals officer for early consideration.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
