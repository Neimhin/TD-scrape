#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	0	As the Taoiseach will be aware, it will be several months before the full impact of the €750 million in health service cuts will be felt in each area.  To date, 1,500 people have left the health service and a further 2,000 are due to leave before the end of February.  In anybody's book that is quite an exodus.  Of the 1,500 who have left, several hundred were front-line nurses, while 50 were full-time consultants.  The Minister for Health has argued that changes to work practices will minimise the impact of the cuts.  I am particularly concerned about cuts to maternity services.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the concerns expressed by a number of senior medical practitioners about cuts to midwifery services, particularly in the mid-west region in which there is due to be an exodus of 25% of staff in February?  Is he aware of the statement made by the senior consultant obstetrician in the region, Dr. Gerry Burke, who said:No plans to deal with the shortfall have been presented by the HSE or the Department of Health.  The shortfall of over 20 per cent of midwifery staff will diminish the quality of maternity care these women and babies receive.Dr. Burke went on to state some of the women and babies to whom he had referred would pay with their lives.  That is a serious assertion to make.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Is the Taoiseach in a position to provide the House with an assurance that the HSE and-or the Department have a contingency plan to deal with this issue?  Will he assure us that the contingency plan is adequate and that it will be in place before the exodus to which I refer occurs at the end of February?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	3	During 2011 the HSE established a system to identify and record the numbers of staff - approximately 2,100 - who were expected to leave before the end of what is known as the "grace period".  The most recent information available indicates that in the period from September last year until the end of February next, some 3,500 staff will have retired from the health service.  Approximately 1,500 retired during the four month period to the end of December 2011 and the remainder have indicated that they will leave by the end of February.The comments made by Dr. Burke were outrageous.  It was beyond the norm for a medical person of his stature to equate the process of staff legitimately leaving the health service under the programme with an attack - in the context of paying back money to German banks - on babies and pregnant mothers.  I am aware of Dr. Burke's interest in serious health reform on which he has written many good articles during the years.  Deputy Willie O'Dea who comes from the mid-west region will know that it is the Government's intention to restructure the health service in order that everyone will have access to services as close to home and in as efficient a manner as possible.The Minister for Health approved the HSE's service plan in the past two weeks, with a contingency to the effect that the first review of the plan will take place at the end of February.  The reason for this review is that the picture will become clear on the number who will have left the health service and also in respect of the categories and sectors they will have left.  The Deputy can take it that the HSE has a contingency plan.  However, it is not possible to determine the outcomes until we know the numbers of those who intend to leave.  As the Deputy is aware, staff can decide to remain or leave right up to the deadline.  Obviously, there will be pressure points.  Where these will be will depend on the number of staff who leave, for example, the maternity service in the mid-west region or elsewhere.  The Minister has made it perfectly clear that once the position on the numbers leaving particular sectors becomes evident, the plans of his Department and the HSE will come into play.  We want to see a situation develop where all patients, be they young or old, will be given the best treatment which the medical services can provide.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I am well aware of the concerns expressed over a long period with regard to the inadequacies of the health service.  I am also aware of the brilliant work being done by so many in pressurised front-line positions.  In that context, when patients get into the system, they receive the best care and attention.  We want to allow everybody to have the opportunity to receive such care and attention.  That is why it is necessary to change the structures within the health system.  The Minister for Health has set out the Government's intention to move, during its lifetime, to a universal health structure.  This will not be achieved by clinging to an aspiration that the best care and attention can be provided in the absence of major changes.When one considers the amount of money to be taken out of the health service over a period, one realises this is bound to have an impact.  Of course, we are concerned about the level of care and attention provided for every patient, but the best service will not be achieved easily without making difficult choices on the structures that have to be put in place.  I know Dr. Burke has written quite a few articles on changes to the structure and reform of the health service.  However, government is about looking after the interests of everybody.  This is challenging, but the Deputy can take it that the Minister who is a medical practitioner is conscious of the necessity to ensure the best care and attention is provided for every patient.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	15	This is one of the Taoiseach's big days, the day on which he gives another €1.25 billion to bondholders, while imposing savage austerity on the rest of the citizens.  He might be aware that during the general election campaign this bond traded for as low as 54 cent in the euro, presumably because the ratings agencies believed Fine Gael and the Labour Party would stick to their promise to impose burden sharing on senior bondholders.  Of course, they are the insiders who know the inside track.  The Taoiseach has proved them right and they will make a huge profit at the expense of citizens.Dúirt An Tánaiste, an Teachta Eamon Gilmore, gur economic treason a bhí ann na scairshealbhóirí in Anglo Irish Bank a íoc.  Cé hiad na scairshealbhóirí?  Cén fáth nach dtugann an Rialtas na hainmneacha dúinn?  An bhfuil eagla ar an Rialtas roimh saoránaigh agus an daonlathas?  Will the Taoiseach name the bondholders?  The Oireachtas and the people have the right to know who they are.  Whether they are rural communities hit by septic tank charges, individuals hit by hikes in VAT, elderly patients, persons in maternity wards, the 500,000 unemployed or emigrants, every single citizen and the Oireachtas have the right to know the names of the bondholders to whom the Government is giving €1.25 billion of the people's money.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Teachta nach bhfuil faitíos, scanradh, imní nó eagla ar an Rialtas faoin rud seo.  Ba mhaith liom bheith in ann seasamh suas anseo agus a rá leis nach cóir go mbeadh an airgead seo le n-íoc, ach caithfear é a íoc.  Níl slí ar bith eile as seo amach.  Tá a fhios aige go raibh suas le €97 billiún le n-íoc i 2008.  Níl fágtha faoi láthair ach €2.6 billiún.  Tá an airgead seo le n-íoc ar maidin.We had this out yesterday in advance of what the Deputy calls my big day.  I do not like to see a situation where this repayment has to be made to bondholders.  I do not have a list of their names, but I am sure the names of those in possession of the bonds have changed often since they were first acquired.  However, I would like to repeat what I said yesterday.  The Deputy seems to consider that there is an alternative, but if we do not pay this money, he has failed to point out from where the moneys to provide services for the people in the Visitors Gallery and throughout the country would come.  He is aware that we have received €110 billion for the covered banks at very low interest rates to keep the country moving.  The challenge for the Government is to sort out the public finances, close the deficit, grow the economy and provide jobs and opportunities for people here at home.  The Deputy's idea that the Government can state it will not pay is simply nonsensical.The Minister for Finance returned yesterday from Frankfurt having spoken to Mr. Draghi of the European Central Bank.  The challenge and opportunity under discussion is to have flexibility shown by our European colleagues towards the promissory notes which will require a €3 billion payment in each of the next ten years.  Flexibility is of great importance to Ireland.  These discussions are under way in the same way that there were discussions on a reduction in the interest rate charged which, according to some commentators, was never going to happen.It is not easy to say this, but the money must be repaid.  The alternative would be catastrophic, given what has happened in Greece, where 100,000 public servants have been let go, public sector salaries have been drastically reduced and services decimated.  We cannot and will not allow that to happen here.There are some signs of some confidence returning.  Yields of 6% yesterday indicate growing interest and confidence in the international community in investing in this country.  We have a very long way to go, but we have been pointed in the right direction.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Taoiseach says he does not know the names of the bondholders.  With respect, that is not good enough.  It is a disgrace.  He says we say there is another way.  That is correct; we believe there is another way.  What happened to the five point pln and promise of openness when in government?  The deference the Taoiseach shows to the bondholders contrasts sharply with the Government's attitude to citizens.  We heard yesterday from Dr. Gerry Burke, a consultant obstetrician in Limerick, who warned that the loss of 47 midwives in the mid-western regional maternity hospital in Limerick next month might cost lives.  Ministers wax lyrical about the awful consequences if we do not pay the bonds.  Do they give any consideration to the social consequences?This morning I wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General, asking him to investigate these payments, to whom they will be made, the profits to be made and whether he considers this to be an appropriate use of public funds.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said, "If the Taoiseach's Government knew that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent and asked the Irish taxpayer to bail it out and pay the cost we are now paying for it, that was and is economic treason.  I stand over that."  Does he still support that proposition?  Will the Taoiseach find the names of the bondholders before we have to search to establish who they are?

However, he has refused to tell the public how he would propose to deal with the consequences of that action.  The ECB has advanced €110 billion to keep services in this country going.  The Deputy has failed to point out how he would pay teachers, gardaí and nurses and fill ATM machines to keep the economy moving.  I do not have access to a list of the names of bondholders.  The bigger benefit to the country lies in supporting the Government in explaining to our European colleagues that showing greater flexibility in our meeting a promissory note of €30 billion over a period of ten years would bring great benefit to every citize.  If we can arrive at a successful conclusion to these discussions, it will have an impact on the deficit and make it easier for us to repay our debt.  Ireland is heading in the right direction.  This is not easy; it is very challenging and impacts on services.  We must make choices as to how we will maintain front-line services to the best of our ability.  Deputy Willie O'Dea asked a legitimate question about maintaining such services.This is why when the number of people who will leave at the end of February becomes known-----

Whatever the Taoiseach's likes and dislikes about what is happening, it is a dismal day when we must hand over €1.2 billion.  My concern is with regard to the Government response to legitimate criticism on what it is doing today which is, after all, implementing the policies of the previous Government.  The scare tactics used in response to the criticism in the past week have not contributed constructively to the debate.  The Tánaiste spoke of not being able to pay gardaí, nurses or teachers.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport spoke of a financial time bomb going off in Dublin.  Let us have a legitimate argument about this.I understand the Taoiseach's insistence and argument that his priority is to return to the bond markets as early as possible and say goodbye to the troika.  This is a legitimate aim.  However I wish to point out something to him and ask him whether he has considered it.

This type of airgead draíochta is not around.  It is the formula which caused the monetary chaos and economic collapse of the post-Soviet Union rouble zone in the early 1990s.  This year we must take €3 billion out of the Irish economy.  Deputy Ross's formula is to deal with the deficit of €16 billion in one fell swoop.  Does he seriously consider that something of this magnitude could be done without catastrophic consequences for the ordinary citizens of the country?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	56	What is at stake here is what provides the greater benefit in the interest of Ireland and its people.  Given the extent of what has already been paid in respect of Anglo Irish Bank - Deputy Ross made recommendations about people associated with it and their stellar performance - what is left means the greater benefit is in following the route of explaining to our European colleagues the very onerous burden on the Irish taxpayers with regard to the promissory notes.  This conversation has started and has been enhanced by the troika itself making a proposal to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, that they should prepare a paper.  Yesterday's conclusion was that this is worth pursuing.  The greater benefit to Ireland, our economy and our taxpayers is to be able to get greater flexibility with regard to the fiscal burden of the promissory notes.Were we able with co-operation and consent to shift the burden into the facilities now available through the EFSF or the ESM it would greatly reduce our deficit and make it much more manageable to deal with our debt.  This would also be in the interest of Europe in that it would see a country in a bailout programme having made and risen to very serious challenges coming out of the programme thereby proving that where people, government and Europe work together the economies of the European Union as a whole can grow.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	60	No we will not.  The Deputy must ask a supplementary question.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I am sure we will not.  I will ask the Taoiseach a supplementary question.  It is a serious question and I would like him to answer it.  Is the Minister for Finance in his negotiations with the European Central Bank and Olli Rehn intent on focusing simply on the terms of the Irish sovereign debt or is he prepared to look at, and is he looking for, a write-off of some of the substantial capital?

Even Deputy Ross with his long-range spectrum is unable to determine what the growth figures for any individual country might be in the future.The Government has not looked for any write-off and is not looking for a write-off.  We have paid our way and will pay our way.  The Minister has been very careful and clear to point out we are now involved in a process of discussion with the ECB and our colleagues in Europe to get greater flexibility with regard to the promissory notes which will cost €3 billion per year for each of the next ten years.  This would be of enormous benefit to our economy and our taxpayers.  This process is now in train and is enhanced by the proposal from the troika itself that the Ministers here should prepare a paper.  When this paper is presented it will have the status of a troika paper.  In the meantime the Irish Government and officials from the Department of Finance will engage in technical discussions on what it entails in so far as our colleagues are concerned.There is no question of seeking a write down.  There is a question of discussion and negotiation about the facility and the greater flexibility that could be shown to us in getting the EFSF and the ESM facilities applied to the extent of borrowing for a bank re-capitalisation before the country entered into the bailout.  This is the position and the discussion is now under way.It is not down for decision on Monday or at the next Council meeting, but it is one in which we are involved with our colleagues.  If we could bring it to a conclusion, it would be of great benefit to the taxpayer, the economy and the country.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No.15 shall be taken today and, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	73	No.  This legislation discriminates against citizens across rural Ireland and has not been properly discussed.  Like others, my party has brought forward a series of amendments, some of which might not even be reached.  We are proposing, for example, a grants system to ensure those who cannot bear the cost involved would be assisted.  The standards against which septic tanks will be measured have not yet been set down and homeowners do not even know the size of the bill they could be faced with to upgrade their septic tank.I am mindful that this issue dates back to 1975 and was dealt with by a number of Governments involving the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and that there is now a rush to deal with it.  It seems to be a characteristic of the Government to rush measures through the House.  However, I ask the Taoiseach to allow adequate time for discussion of a raft of amendments to the Bill.

This is a matter on which the debate should continue in the way proposed by the Chief Whip.  I do not see any reason it should not proceed in that way.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has listened to a great range of arguments and will shortly be in a position to make his decisions known.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I call Deputy O'Dea.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	79	In an uncharacteristic outburst of magnanimity the Minister for Justice and Equality has promised to pardon various members of the Irish Army who deserted to join the British Army during the Second World War.  Can the Taoiseach advise if legislation will be necessary to make that pardon a reality or can it be done by way of statutory instrument?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	80	That is a matter for a parliamentary question; it is not a matter of promised legislation.

In regard to the fiscal responsibility Bill, if I heard the Taoiseach correctly, he said he intends to bring in some of the outworkings of the treaty.  When does he expect the fiscal responsibility Bill to be published and is it possible to publish the heads of that Bill?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Bill is due this session.  I cannot give the Deputy an exact date for it.  Clearly, the Government wants to deal with this as a matter of some priority.  I will send the Deputy an update from the Minister for Finance as to when that is likely to happen but it is due this session.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Will that be before or after the referendum on the austerity treaty?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Deputy is speculating again, and not for the first time.  I explained yesterday how this will work.  When the Heads of Government agree, disagree or whatever in respect of the final text of the intergovernmental treaty on Monday, that will then be sent for signature and it is at that stage that the Attorney General here will give formal legal advice.  While it is correct to say that personnel from the Attorney General's office have looked at the draft as it moves along, it is not until the text is complete in its entirety that a full formal response can be given.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	86	There is much concern about legislation proposed by the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, for Tuesday next.  I have been contacted, as I am sure many Deputies have, by many people who are concerned about this.  I have just got off the phone from someone who runs a major Internet company in Ireland.  His concern, and that of his colleagues who are running other Internet companies, is that they will immediately have to shut down all operations because this legislation would force them into the courts because they cannot control all links to IP.  There is huge concern about this.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	87	What is the legislation?  What is the name of it?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Then what is the name of it?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	92	It is due to be passed as secondary legislation by ministerial order on Tuesday.  Would it be possible to pause the ministerial order, even for a few days, and to have the legislation published and debated by the House?  I have spoken to some very credible people in Ireland who are saying this has serious implications for Internet provision in Ireland, for American multinationals here and for the smart economy and so forth.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I have read the report of this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is dealing with the matter.  In the High Court judgment of 11 October 2010, in the case of  EMI & Others v  UPC, Mr. Justice Charleton decided he was constrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and thus could not grant an injunction to prevent infringement of copyright against UPC, which is an information service provider, ISP, in the circumstances of mere conduit, or transient communications.  In doing so Mr. Justice Charleton stated that Ireland had not fully transposed the relevant directive.  The mere conduit principle provides that if an ISP does not initiate a transmission or modify the material contained in the transmission and does not select the receiver of the transmission it is granted safe harbour against liability by virtue of the eCommerce Directive 2000/31/EC.  However, according to the same directive this freedom from liability does not affect the power of the courts to require service providers to terminate or prevent copyright infringements.This gets very complicated.  I understand the matter is being brought before the Cabinet, so there will be some short period for explanation.  I could give the Deputy a very detailed response.The Attorney General, at that time, was asked by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for his advice as to the implications of the High Court judgment.  While the Attorney General considered that the position is not as clear cut as Mr. Justice Charleton suggests, his advice was that as long as the Irish courts take the view that subsection 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 does not implement Article 8.3 of the relevant directive, Ireland is exposed to a claim for damages for failure to implement EU law.  The prudent course he advised was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance.It is a complicated procedure but I expect the Minister of State will explain it more fully.  I am aware of the comments some providers have made.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Deputy, you must understand this is about promised legislation.

With the publication last week of the HSE National Service Plan 2011 which implements serious cuts in the current year and beyond, will the House have an opportunity to debate the national service plan and to ask pertinent questions?  When is it intended to schedule that opportunity for Members, given the enormity of what is involved?The HSE governance Bill was promised for publication during the spring session.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, line 20, after "Directives" to insert the following:"and publish a set of agreed standards for septic tanks and treatment systems".This amendment proposes the inclusion in the Bill of a reference to "a set of agreed standards".  This is very important.  We have discussed the standards for septic tanks with the Minister.  We are in the dark at the moment.  We do not know what standards will apply or what regulation will flow from them.  We welcomed a commitment the Minister gave on Committee Stage.  I hope he will restate it in public in this Chamber today.  He said he intended to provide for a four-week period of consultation on the issue of the standards and regulations applying to septic tanks.  That is important.  It would have been helpful if that had happened during the run-in to the introduction of this Bill, in advance of the debates on the various Stages.  The argument on the vexed question of providing grant aid to assist those who will be forced to comply with these standards has swung back and forwards.  After all the debate on the matter, it is clear to me that the Environmental Protection Agency will set out the standards.  Those standards will be enforced by inspectors and local authorities, rather than by anybody in this Chamber.  We cannot criminalise people in rural areas by imposing fines of up to €5,000 on them if they do not have the wherewithal to upgrade their septic tanks.Sinn Féin supports the whole notion of having clean water and protecting ground water.  There is a need to proceed in a careful way, however.  I support the Minister's proposal to adopt a risk-based approach.  We agree with him in that regard.  The next step should be to set out the standards clearly.  We should use the consultation period to make sure people are clear about where this is going.  The public should be informed in a clear way of the regulations.  They have to be fair.  A scheme of grants must be put in place to assist people.  Many people in rural areas are in negative equity.  They are suffering as a result of increases in the cost of rural transport, home heating oil and car taxes.  People in rural areas pay bin charges.  I do not know whether they will pay the household charge, but they are facing the prospect of having to do so.  This Bill will introduce the septic tank charge.  People in group water schemes that have been taken into charge by local authorities are also facing water charges.  The problem is that this string of charges is as long as a big shopping list.  We have to make a commitment to give some assistance to those affected.  This legislation is being pushed through and guillotined.  The debate on it will conclude tomorrow.  I would like the Minister to outline his pitch on this at some stage today or tomorrow.  Kilkenny has a habit of keeping all the surprises until it gets to the final stages of the big match in Dublin.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	169	He should assist people in rural areas, particularly those on low incomes who are living in houses that are served by old septic tanks, by putting measures in place to help them to upgrade their facilities.  We should not criminalise them.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I would like to support Deputy Stanley's amendment.  I do not think it is right to wait until the legislation has been passed before publishing the standards.  We will be asked tomorrow to vote for a Bill without knowing what standards or guidelines will apply to any remedial works that will have to be carried out under it.  The Minister is aware that the standards and guidelines that apply to percolation tests, when planning applications are made for the installation of septic tanks or biocycle units, have been changed on many occasions over the last 47 years.  Depending on the guidelines and standards that are put in place, people who received planning permission between 1975 and 2009 might not meet those guidelines or standards.  In such circumstances, remedial work will have to be carried out in accordance with whatever the new standards will be.  I assume they will be consistent with the 2009 requirements, or close enough to them.  Those whose systems do not pass the percolation test will find themselves having to carry out remedial work, which can be quite costly.  Some of the Minister's officials have said the cost of such work could be as high as €17,000.  That would depend on the type of land on which percolation tests were done and in respect of which planning permission was granted in the past.  Obviously, that would be a frightening and alarming set of circumstances for people in rural Ireland.When the standards are in place, Sinn Féin will fully support the carrying out of all remedial works to ensure the water table and water sources are protected.  It would be an injustice if people who have done nothing illegal were compelled to carry out remedial works that could cost a great deal of money.  They were given planning permission when they applied for it at the time and they have complied with it, including the guidelines regarding percolation and septic tank arrangements.  They are now finding that they will not be in compliance with the guidelines.  It might cost them a large sum of money to bring their systems up to the required standard.  It is not their fault.  It is certainly not the fault of anyone who applied for planning permission since 1975.  The fault lies with successive Governments that failed to comply with the EU directives or regulations.  There is no point in crying over spilt milk.  We need to move forward by meeting the requirement, as determined by the EU, to protect water sources and water tables.  While I fully support the carrying out of the necessary remedial works, it has to be conditional on people not being out of pocket as a result.  The standards that applied in 1975 might not be in line with the standards that will be initiated as a result of this legislation.  This needs to be borne in mind and a common-sense approach is needed.  The Minister should indicate what those standards will be.  All of us who represent rural communities are inundated with queries regarding the situation.  Significant concerns and fears are being expressed.  I have been involved in organising meetings to outline the content of the legislation and explain it to people who attend those meetings in large numbers, over 2,000 people in the four meetings I have attended.  There is fear and we want to allay those fears and to reassure people that they will not be out of pocket again.  They are being caught for every type of stealth charge.  Rural Ireland is again being effectively discriminated against.  All of us taxpayers have contributed to the cost of upgrading urban water treatment units and it now seems that rural Ireland will be held responsible and accountable for any funding necessary to bring its septic tanks or treatment units up to scratch.  In my view this is unfair.  The people of rural Ireland need to stand together on this issue and the Minister should be aware of this.  The Minister represents a very large rural community and he is well acquainted with the views the Opposition is expressing.  We want to be constructive and we want a situation where this can be addressed.  All of us are very committed to protecting our water sources and the water table and to having a proper and adequate sewerage system in place for rural housing.  It would help if the Minister would publish those standards and give us an opportunity to debate them in the House rather than deciding to publish them for public consultation after the standards have already been put in place.  This is the wrong way to do business.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I acknowledge that the Minister agreed during the Committee Stage debate that he would engage in a four-week period of consultation regarding the standards and this is to be commended.  We need to have meaningful engagement.  During Committee Stage my party proposed that the representatives of the various stakeholder organisations, including the EPA, Engineers Ireland, local authority managers and Irish rural dwellers, would be afforded an opportunity to give their views.  I take this opportunity to ask whether the intent of that proposal can be considered during the four-week consultation period.  I hope we will be afforded an opportunity to meet the EPA in particular because it will be the lead organisation, the main driver for setting the standard and the roll-out of the inspection and enforcement regime.  I ask for an assurance from the Minister that those organisations will be asked to appear before a committee so we can have face time, as they say in the United States, with these groups in order to tease out the issues.  It is broadly acknowledged that the nub of the issue is what will be the standard, along with some other important nuances such as how the inspections will be carried out.  People are concerned, primarily, as regards the potential cost arising.I echo what has been said by Deputies Brian Stanley and Martin Ferris.  Everybody in rural Ireland wants to play their part in promoting clean water and a better water standard.  There has been much political debate on this issue.  It is not a case of the great unwashed beyond the Pale and Dublin who do not seem to give a damn about water quality.  People in rural Ireland are as concerned about the environment as anyone else.  The point has been rightly made with regard to the urban-rural divide.  Many people living in all parts of urban Dublin own septic tanks in their holiday homes down the country so this is as pertinent an issue for many people living in Dublin as it is for the many people living in the countryside.  I ask for clarification regarding our proposal and I ask for an assurance that these organisations, primarily the EPA, will be brought before a committee during the four-week consultation period to help inform us on the issue.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I would like if the Minister showed a bit of respect for the office he holds by not interrupting me.I wanted information from the Minister on Committee Stage on exactly what standard was being applied.  He gave me a hopelessly pathetic nonsensical answer.  As everybody knows, it is not enough for a person to say, "That tank is working" because one engineer can assess a tank as working while another engineer can come along and say it is not working.  The two of them can be professionals but if they are not working to a set standard or regulations, how do they know what standard they are to apply?  This is why the people the length and breadth of rural Ireland are worried and concerned.  This is why when Deputy Martin Ferris called a meeting that 500 people turned up because they wanted information and they wanted answers.  The Minister and his Government were not providing answers so that is why they wanted information.  To say the Government has made a bags of this is to be very kind.  It has handled the issue in a shoddy, unprofessional, hopeless and shambolic fashion.  I make this accusation because the Government is terrorising people in rural Ireland.  We all know that virtually every local authority has towns and villages that either have no sewage treatment plants or inadequate plants.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	208	When we seek funding to upgrade those schemes, we are told local authorities do not have the money to fund the upgrades.  If it is all right for a local authority to argue that it cannot upgrade a sewage treatment plant in a town or village, or if it can continue to pollute in such a fashion, how can the Minister tell a householder that his or her system must be upgraded?  That person may not have the money to upgrade and people in rural Ireland are today struggling with unemployment and children at home who have not found work.  People are in a desperate position and they may never have believed they would find themselves there, as we got away through the 1950s and 1960s, and we survived the 1980s.  People are now in a financial position that they never saw coming.  In its infinite wisdom, our Government thinks it is all right to impose this new regulation at a time when people can least afford it.As we are discussing rural Ireland, we should understand that no person respects the countryside more than the people who live in it.

It is odd as nobody cherishes and appreciates the land and waterways more than a farmer or a person living in the countryside.  The Government does not seem to understand that logic at all.The majority of people have tanks which are working properly but our Government is going to send out inspectors.  It is codding the people into registering so it can form a database, and the Minister can charge whatever he likes for re-registering.  I will give the Minister credit as he told me last week there would be no new re-registration fee.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Without interruption.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	219	At a time when people can least afford it, they are already overly regulated.  A farmer in the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme, REPS, has all types of inspections and on top of everything else, he will have a person coming around the back of the house to peer into the septic tank and inspect the ground around it.  At the same time, people are being misinformed by the Government.  They are not being given information about what an inspector will look for; the Minister has only said that the tank must be working.We were misled in the Dáil some two weeks ago by a Minister, Deputy Quinn.  He told us that from early February, there would be a fine of €26,000 or €27,000 per day, which is the reason the Government was to rush this legislation.  Apparently, there was no choice as the taxpayer could not be exposed to this fine.  I compliment Deputy Ó Cuív and others working with him who discovered afterwards that the Minister misled the Dáil.  The following day Deputy Ó Cuív showed us how the Commission had indicated that we would not have to possibly - not even definitely - pay a fine until the summer months.  There would have been plenty of time to debate this matter further and for the Minister to give out the proper information, letting the people know exactly what standard would be applied.This will have an implication for people living in rural locations.  A person who built a house in 1970 would have applied to the local authority and got planning permission, which would have contained rules and guidelines that would have been strictly adhered to with regard to the treatment of waste water.  Some 39 years later there are the new Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, guidelines, which are far removed from what was required in the past.  Will we tell those people who put in legal systems many years ago - complete with planning permission - that the system could be wrong and must be ungraded to meet the 2009 standards from the EPA guidelines?  We do not have the required information so we do not know what guidelines are involved.  We know the people, in good faith, did what was required of them by the local authority which granted permission.  It is extremely unfair to tell those people that they must upgrade to meet today's guidelines.From the start, the Minister has handled the issue very poorly.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The Deputy told us that already.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	221	He has shown poor political judgment and the people who are advising the Minister are also slipping up.  It is unfair to bring this Bill through the Dáil today and tomorrow without proper information being given to the people.  When the Minister attacks me and tries to make soundbites at my expense, he should remember he is not attacking me - I am only one small person - he is attacking the 500 people who were at a meeting with me and Deputy Ferris.  He is attacking the 800 people at a public meeting a couple of weeks ago attended by Deputy Mattie McGrath.  The Minister should not mind us with his sniping as we are the representatives-----

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Minister should not believe that if he is looking down his nose at Deputies Ferris, Mattie McGrath or Healy-Rae, he will get away with it.  There are many people behind us and the Minister is looking down his nose at them.  It is not nice, and no Deputy or Minister should do it.  The Minister should know better.  I would not have to say anything to him if he did not draw me on him.  That is the Minister's fault.I am totally opposed to what is going through today and tomorrow.  The people with the septic tanks should be left alone and the polluters - such as the local authorities - should be dealt with.  Every town and village in Ireland should have a system that is 100%, with not one inch of pollution.  If that could be done, the Minister could start talking about septic tanks and other issues.  We all know it is not the person living in a rural location with a septic tank who is causing pollution in our waterways.  The Minister is going after the wrong people and imposing an expense that is totally unnecessary.  He is ignoring the elephant in the room, which is our local authorities.  What is going on in some of our villages around the country is shameful.  Having spoken to other Deputies, it appears that is the case in the majority of towns and villages.There are Deputies who support the Minster but who return to their constituencies to argue that they are with the people.  I wonder what those Deputies will do when we have votes today and tomorrow on the issue.  Will they stand with the people who elected them or with the Minister in the folly he is pursuing?  Deputies will vote on this issue.They should give serious consideration to what they are doing. It is not just the people in the Chamber who are looking at them - the eyes of Ireland will be on them today and tomorrow in terms of what they do.  They can stand with the people or stand with the Government, but I remind them that they cannot do the two things.  One is either with the Government on the issue or one is against it.  I remind Deputies not to try to be all things to all people because that is not going down so well in the constituencies either.

I hope that when it comes to votes in the course of the debate Members will see that people in rural areas are being hounded.  The only thing we are short of at this stage is an inspector going up the stairs and going underneath the bed to see what is going on there.  At this stage we are not far away from that.The only other thing I wish to highlight, which again shows the wholly incompetent way the Minister has dealt with the issue, is the fact that he ignored the calls at public meetings to deal with cases where a person is deemed to have to carry out remedial work but who does not have money to carry out the work.  What provision will be made for such people?  Does the Minister intend to make proposals to provide financial assistance?  Surely be to God, we did have that, and we are grateful that was the case-----
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Deputy Healy-Rae reminds me of Columbo with "Just one more thing".  He has used that phrase repeatedly.  Could he wrap up please?
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I am finishing now.  When we wanted to carry out upgrades to farm waste water management systems to prevent pollution a grant system was put in place that allowed farmers to build slatted sheds, concrete yards and collect waste water in a proper manner.  Now we are telling people they are in limbo because there is no proposal coming from the Government on how people will be assisted.  I remind the Minister who has lost touch with reality that people do not have money.  They do not have spare money under the bed or in a box that they can call upon at any time a calamity befalls them.  Since the Minister came into office many onerous additional expenses have been imposed on families to such an extent that they certainly do not have spare money.  How does the Minister propose that people should pay for an upgrade if they do not have the money?  I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I hope I will get a further opportunity to speak in the course of the debate.

I am delighted the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, is present and that he is giving fair play to Members.  I commend him on that.  It is very important.Ar an céad dul síos, I tried to raise something on the Order of Business and the Ceann Comhairle got very irate at me.  I acknowledged that I was not blaming him for the situation.  I received a letter last night from the Ceann Comhairle's office on the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, Report Stage.  It stated: "Dear Mattie, I regret to inform you that amendment No. 36, tabled by you for Report Stage of the above Bill, must be ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer."  It reminded me of a programme "Dear Frankie" that I used listen to on the radio when I went to school.  She would have replied back "Dear Mattie", in her eloquent voice.  This is a joke.

He said he understood that the committee adjourned a couple of hours early last week.  We got on fine on Committee Stage in the morning last week but when we came back after dinner, Deputy Coonan, who was Acting Chairman, had eaten something that did not agree with him.  I do not know if it was the spuds, the cabbage or the salmon.  I am sure the officials informed him that amendments Nos. 12, 20, 24 and 25-----

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Several amendments I had tabled on Committee Stage were ruled out of order for the nonsensical reason that it might result in a cost to the Exchequer.  The argument does not stand up.  The fact that I am speaking in the House today is a cost to the Exchequer.  The Acting Chairman being in the Chair is a cost to the Exchequer.  The water I drink is a cost to the Exchequer.  It is patent nonsense.  If that is to be the cornerstone of our democracy we might as well all stay at home and save the Exchequer and give it to Anglo Irish Bank.  We are giving it €1.25 billion today.  We could give it another €0.5 billion as well.  The reason is farcical and I object strenuously to it.  I do not blame the Ceann Comhairle but I wonder who is dreaming up these rules.  Is this the transparency and open government we were promised?  The lads opposite spent a long time on the Opposition benches but they learned a great deal very fast.  They must have written down all the things for which they blamed the previous Government and gave it to spin doctors to amalgamate it and mush it up.  It is a shame.To return to the Bill, it would be worthwhile to discuss the amendment if we were to do nothing else today.  We need proper answers.We would be better off without laughter from the few on the benches opposites.  Deputy Tom Hayes invited his colleague from Mayo, Deputy Michelle Mulherin, to come to the front bench to sit beside him and make it look good, whether it was for reason of aesthetics or laughter, I do not know.  I welcome Deputy Mulherin.  Last week in the committee she said she got tired of looking at proceedings on the monitor and she came down to lecture us.  I took her to task for it.  She is elected in the same way as I am but I was very shocked that she came down to lecture us on the issue.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Yes.  We are dealing with Deputy Stanley's amendment.  I said it is important to discuss it even if we discussed nothing else today.  If the Minister wanted to be fair, honest and up front with people the very first thing he should have done was to publish a set of agreed standards for septic tanks and their treatment.  That should have been the basic start of the matter.  That is the kernel of the problem.The Minister is probably aware by now that I was on his local radio station this morning explaining the situation to people in Kilkenny because he has not held a public meeting there to inform anyone of what is happening.  I recently found out that Deputy Hayes is bringing him to Dundrum in County Tipperary, a nice big estate with a big tree-lined avenue.  That is the kind of place people in Fine Gael prefer - the landed gentry.  He can have it.  Many people will be up in the trees and around the trees waiting for him, as they are waiting in the long grass.This is a patent nonsense.  It is an insult to people in rural areas to pass such a Bill.  I will not vote for it.  As Deputy Healy-Rae said, the Minister expects his own Deputies to say one thing in the country.  When Deputy Hayes is asked about a tank in Golden which we know is running straight into the River Suir, he says it will be fine, that it will pass the test.  When Deputy Hayes comes to Dublin he will pass a Bill with no standards.  Dúirt bean liom go dúirt bean lei go raibh ag Tiobraid Árainn a bhfuil póca ina léine aige.  There was a great deal of dúirt bean liom and dúirt bean lei in this.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh a lán mná agus fir - there will be - at the meeting in Dundrum if it takes place on 6 February.  I want that to be broadcast.  I hope it is a public meeting.  I asked the Minister if I could go.  He said it is up to Deputy Hayes.  I do not know who it is up to but I have another engagement that night in west Limerick but I will come back to it.

He should just say it for the record.  It happened last week with a Minister.  On the day Deputy Healy-Rae became unwell the Minister refused to withdraw his comment.  He muttered something and I challenged him on it.  He said he was talking to a Deputy coming into the Chamber.  That is the arrogance with which we are dealing.

This is the Members' first opportunity to contribute on this Stage.  Hence, I am allowing a degree of latitude.  I hope we will complete one amendment before lunch.  I hope Deputy Stanley gets to decide on whether he wants to press his amendment.  When we move further into the debate, I will tie Members more tightly to the amendments under discussion.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I blame the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for applying the guillotine.  We were misled by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  In fairness, the Taoiseach told Deputy Ó Cuív and me in the corridor yesterday that he would try to have the record corrected, as it was patently untrue that fines would be levied by 2 or 3 February.  What we must do by that date is enter a defence to a charge that might appear before the courts in late summer or early autumn.Had the Minister published standards, we would not accuse him of anything.  There are standards for everything.  When I took part in Pat Kenny's radio show, I told the Minister that my tank was built in 1984 and he replied that it would be judged on the 1984 standards.  When I asked about houses built before 1963 when there were no planning standards, he replied that no standards would be applied now.  This is patent and utter nonsense.  There are standards for everything.  I must abide by standards in the Chamber.  I stray sometimes, but the Acting Chairman brings me back, which I appreciate.  There are standards for buying a shirt, a pair of shoes and so on.As Deputy Healy-Rae pointed out, households do not know what the costs will be.  I cannot be honest with people in my constituency because I do not know what standards will be applied.  The Minister claims there will be no standards, but that is not true.  Groups such as An Taisce and rural preservationists will ensure standards, and rightly so.  I agree with Deputy Healy-Rae, in that rural Ireland and clean water are valued the most by fishing clubs, ordinary farmers, hill walkers and communities, not by local governments, which are polluters.Deputy Healy-Rae asked whether the Minister had lost touch with people or whether he knew that people had no money.  I will remind him of one year or 15 months ago, when the Minister, then just a Deputy, stated that he could not afford to take a wage cut.  Can he remember that?  He was no worse paid than I was.  Before the election, the Government promised people-----

It relates to the kernel of the situation, namely, the standards applied to septic tanks.  On Committee Stage on 18 December, Deputy Collins tabled a motion and I commend him for doing so.  Discussing seven amendments took a long time.  Today's debate would not be so long had there been fair play on Committee Stage as was supposed to have been the case.  The Minister told us that he would bring us back in two or three days-----

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	320	-----from here on out, I will rule him out of order and move on to the next speaker.  Come back to Deputy Stanley's amendment, please.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I will.  Standards are the kernel of the issue.  We supported Deputy Collins's motion - unfortunately, we were voted down 7:3 in every vote last week - to invite the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the County and City Managers Association, CAMA, the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, the county engineers association, the architects of Ireland association, An Taisce, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and so on to discuss the standards that would be necessary.  It is fine for the Minister to claim on Committee Stage that no standards will apply, but I want that written into the Bill.  It is fine for him to claim there will be an exemption from planning permission, but I want that written into the Bill.  When that is done, he can show the people of County Tipperary clarity.  People will not be fooled.  They were promised so much last February, they will not be caught again.  What is the saying?  Catch me once, shame on you.  Catch me twice, shame on me.  The people are out there waiting.  I will give Mr. Austin Crowe a call, as he will need many of seats in the room in the Dundrum House Hotel that night.I compliment Deputy Stanley on his amendment.  We need little discussion on this issue, as we all want clean water.  No one's family wants an odour from the septic tank.  People want tanks to work properly, as they paid to have them installed, received planning permission and adhered to the conditions.  It is for local authorities to know what standards applied at the time of a tank's installation, as there was no EPA in the 1970s or early 1980s.  After arriving on the scene, the EPA has grown bigger and more powerful and has become involved in everything.  We need it in certain cases.  My colleague, Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan, is not present, but he got sick of reporting his local authority in Roscommon for polluting the river in Castlerea - he can correct me on that, as I am not sure of my geography - by redirecting sewers.  When he contacted the EPA, the EPA rang the county council and was told the council would check on the issue.  This is the type of policing of county councils that is being done.  We do not know who the inspectors will be.  We do not know what standards they will apply.  If I want to appeal, an inspector will visit.I thank the Minister for accepting amendments.  I have acknowledged that the Bill has been hanging around for a long time.  The last Government should have dealt with it.  Deputy Tom Hayes stated that I voted for this Bill, but it was never before the House.  The Minister need not act like a bulldozer.  He is not Brian Cody and cannot beat everyone off the field.The Bill contains no standards.  The Minister should put the horse before the cart and consider its running form.  Tá sé ag gáire arís.  The best thing he does in the Chamber is ag gáire.  Béal mór ag gáire.   The Minister cannot laugh at the people of south Tipperary.  They are sick and tired of him, given St. Luke's and St. Michael's hospitals, the Army barracks, Cluain Arran, banks and post offices.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Speak to the amendment, please.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Ag béal mór ag gáire í gcónaí.  The Deputy is hiding from the people of Tipperary, but there is nowhere to hide.Thank God, an inspector from the council will only visit a house by arrangement.  Home owners will not wake up in the morning to see inspectors in their back gardens.  The Minister has acknowledged that they cannot get away with that, as someone would have been shot or hurt.  Common sense was displayed.  They would not have been hurt by violent people, but one's home is one's castle.  We are discussing people going into the back of a person's house without that person's knowledge, but another Bill means that the owner can use physical force to restrain anyone breaking into the property.If there is a problem, an inspector can tell an owner to do X, Y or Z to correct it.  If there is no problem, everyone can be delighted.  If there is, though, a person can appeal.  Under duress and following amendments tabled by the Opposition, the Minister changed the cost of the appeal from €200 to €20.  Under duress as well, I thank him for doing so.  However, another inspector will then come out, presumably also from the local authority.  One of the problems, of course, is that we do not know who the inspectors will be.  I assume they will be local authority employees, but my own county council has not been able to confirm this for me.  The second inspector will hardly condemn the actions of the previous inspector, who we assume will be a colleague from the same office.If the householder is not satisfied with the findings of the second inspection, he or she must then appeal the matter to the District Court.  That is ridiculous.  People can be brought to court by the Garda for speeding or whatever, something of which I have experience myself, and one can fight one's case.  One must go to the District Court to obtain a public service vehicle licence or pub licence.  Are we now to expect ordinary householders to go to the District Court to appeal a decision relating to the standards with which their septic tanks must comply?  That amounts to criminalising people.It also begs the question of what expenses will arise.  The District Court might only be the start of it.  Solicitors and barristers will be engaged to argue both sides and, before one knows it, the matter could progress on to the Circuit Court and thereafter to the High Court and Supreme Court.  It is outrageous.  There should be a third party arbitrator, such as An Bord Pleanála in the case of planning issues, which can make decisions in these matters.  Driving people into the courts system amounts to a criminalisation of rural householders.  There are major issues such as this to consider within the scope of this amendment.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	327	As Deputy McGrath knows, the debate is scheduled to conclude at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow.  Six Deputies have indicated their wish to contribute on this amendment.  I will allow the Deputy to come back in later, if he so wishes.  I ask him, with respect to other Members, to be as tight as possible in his contributions.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I appreciate that.  However, some of the Deputies who wish to speak today could have participated in the debate in the committee last week instead of coming in at intervals, as several Fine Gael Party Members did, merely to make up a quorum.  The exception was Deputy Michelle Mulherin, who came in from her office to lecture us all.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Please, Deputy.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	330	It is patent nonsense and arrogance of the highest extreme, but that is not unusual for the Fine Gael Party.  Will the Minister, at this late stage, have some respect for the people who put him in office?  There is a great deal of important work to be done in his Department and, in fairness to the Minister, he has already done some good work.  I ask him to have sense and to include the standards in the legislation.  He promised last week on Committee Stage that there would be a consultation process.  What is the point in consultation after the Bill is passed?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I ask the Deputy to conclude.

It was the same last night in respect of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, with the regulatory impact analysis taking place only after the Bill is passed.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	333	It bears repeating what several Members have said, that everybody agrees pollution must be tackled to ensure clean drinking water for every household in the country.  There is no dispute about that.  However, there is a view out there, fuelled by this legislation, that our drinking water is, if not the worst in the world, then certainly the worst in Europe.In that context, it is important to state precisely the position in regard to the pollution of water by septic tanks.  The Environmental Protection Agency's report, Water Quality in Ireland 2007-2009, found that 85% of ground water bodies were of good status.  Moreover, of the 15% that were of poor status, the EPA found that the greatest proportion of contamination was caused by the input of pollutants, mainly phosphate, probably from agricultural activities, with on-site waste water treatment systems being identified as possibly a minor source.  The report of the eastern river basin management plan, which covers the north-eastern, mid-eastern and eastern counties of Louth, Cavan, Offaly, Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford, was similarly clear in its findings.  It estimated that 75% of the costs associated with effecting improvements in water quality to the required levels by 2015 relate to the municipal and industrial sectors, with septic tank improvements amounting to only 5% of the total costs.  While we are all agreed on the need to ensure supplies of clean, fresh drinking water, the suggestion that drinking water in Ireland is anything but good is simply inaccurate.  The independent reports from the EPA and others are there to prove that.  Moreover, those reports make clear that septic tanks are responsible only to a very minor degree for water contamination.There is huge opposition to this legislation among rural dwellers.  I spoke at several meetings in south Tipperary at which up to 1,000 people attended.  One of the main queries arising is the question of standards.  It is an entirely reasonable query.  As it is, we are effectively being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  The Minister tells us he knows what the standards will be, but nobody else seems to know.  I certainly do not.  As such, I support Deputy Brian Stanley's amendment No. 1.  It is a reasonable and commonsensical proposal.  For the large numbers of people who are affected by this legislation, it is a proposal that is of key concern.  They want to know the standards to which their septic tanks will have to conform and who will pay for the remediation measures that may be required.Quite apart from the question of whether one supports this legislation, and I do not, the demand that there be transparency in regard to standards is reasonable and sensible.  Rural people, irrespective of what the Minister or my colleague from south Tipperary, Deputy Tom Hayes, says, are confused and concerned.  They have a right to know what the standards will be, and that information should be included in the legislation.  I support the amendment.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	334	We would all agree that science and technology have moved on since the Local Government (Planning and Development Act) 1963 was introduced.  However, some of the contributions today would suggest that the knowledge arising from scientific developments has been lost on certain people.  When we consider that we send money to other countries to help people there to maintain clean water supplies, it is difficult to see how some of the suggestions we have heard today represent any form of forward thinking.  They can only be described as representing political thinking in the form of feeding at the trough of people's misery.We must get back to basics in addressing the problem of water contamination.  I completely understand that people are concerned about these proposals and cynical about the intentions of politicians.  Sometimes it is good to take a step back and go to the tooth of the issue at hand.  What it comes down to is that there is a problem that must be tackled.  This problem was brought to a head by the judgment of the European Court of Justice in October 2009.  We know that as a result we were going to be fined €2.7 million and €26,000 daily thereafter until measures were taken to address the problem.It has been stated most septic tanks are functioning properly.  However, we do not know if that is the case.  Various EPA reports have identified faecal contamination of groundwater which, as we know, is caused by malfunctioning septic tanks and, in some case, malfunctioning local authority sewage treatment plants.  We all know the risks associated with septic tanks.

Local authorities, as water authorities, issue boil notices.  Is it being suggested they are plucking standards from the sky?  People have been prosecuted under the water pollution Acts for contamination caused by malfunctioning septic tanks.  The idea that a problem has arisen suddenly and that if we all ignore it, it will go away-----

From where is this suggestion coming?  People are responsible.  A person whose septic tank is contaminating groundwater has a legal and moral responsibility to his or her neighbour.  Will Deputies who are visited by constituents about the contamination of their water supply tell them to leave their neighbour alone because, after all, his or her septic tank was grand when it was built in 1969 or 1975?  Where is the leadership is this?

It is a wonderful endeavour on the part of primary and secondary schools and some third level colleges to encourage young people to make the connection between people and the environment.  Years ago people turned a blind eye to dumping, the sources of pollution and so on.  We now know, through education, that we are connected with the environment and it is important that our legacy is worthy.  Children know much more about littering, pollution, energy conservation and so on and it is a joy to listen to them.  It is a credit to communities that they are being brought up to have respect for their environment.I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The debate on Committee Stage ran three hours shy of the time allocated at the select sub-committee meeting last week.  However, many of the points that needed to be made and others which did not need to be made were made.  It now appears that Members on the opposite side of the House were only getting started and needed a break in order to get going again today.I was astounded by Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív's remarks during that meeting.  We all know what happened during the cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway.  We know that a malfunctioning wastewater treatment plant at Terryland was identified as one of the prime causes of the outbreak.  Some €3.9 million was spent in Galway at the time.  Some €133 million will be under the water and sewerage investment programme this year.  We know that other cases of cryptosporidium have since been identified, although not on the same scale as that in Galway.In response to my pointing to the problems with septic tanks Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív said that while the wastewater treatment plant had been identified as the cause of the outbreak, septic tanks or animals might also have been responsible.  What he was actually saying was that we really did not know the extent of the problem.  This legislation will help us to get to the bottom of it.  It provides for identification of the location of septic tanks and states that where a septic tank malfunctions, it is the responsibility of the owner, in the public interest and common good, to solve the problem, whether there is a cost involved.  To suggest, therefore, this legislation should not be enacted is irresponsible and short-sighted.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Essentially, my point is that I wholeheartedly support the Minister, Deputy Hogan, in this regard.  I refer to what has just been described by Deputy Healy-Rae as poor political judgment and the reason he does not recognise this type of political judgment.  It is about responsibility and telling people that if one's septic tank has a problem, it must be addressed in a responsible manner.  This is not overkill, as the measure proposes that people will be charged a once-off registration fee of €50.  This constitutes responsible Government and as it is the type of idea one tries to impart to one's children, why can the adults not take the same approach?  If our children are being taught one standard, why can the same standard not be upheld in this Chamber?

Consequently, we cannot have points being put from the other side of the House while a Member is speaking.  If a Member wishes to make a point, he or she should do so in his or her comeback contribution, because we have such a limited time to discuss an important amendment to an important Bill.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this amendment and I note this issue arose on Committee Stage.  At the outset, I acknowledge all Members want people to have access to clean, safe water when they turn on their taps and the Minister is committed to doing this.  Much of the debate on Committee Stage pertained to the void that exists with regard to the statutory instrument and the standards that will be introduced.  I do not dispute the Minister's comments on Committee Stage in respect of the standards that will be introduced on foot of this legislation and I believe they were made in good faith.  However, my concern is that once the primary legislation has been enacted, the Minister's own objectives will end up being watered down within the Department or on foot of decisions made by the European Commission.  The best example in this regard relates to legislation introduced to this House a number of years ago by the current President, Michael D. Higgins, on special protection areas.  Both at the time and subsequently, the then Minister made it clear he was banning the use of sausage machines on bogs nationwide but large tracts of land have been sterilised on foot of that legislation.Consequently, it is important that Members should have sight of the aforementioned statutory instruments, which should be debated on the floor of the Chamber.  Moreover, there is precedent in this regard.  I refer to the legislation pertaining to Aer Lingus, with which the Acting Chairman is familiar.  During its passage through this House, the then Minister, Seamus Brennan, included an amendment specifying the need, even on enactment of that legislation, for a positive affirmation of the disposal of Aer Lingus.  Precedent also exists in respect of planning regulations, some of which require the approval of this House and the Upper House before they can be enacted.  I ask the Minister to include an amendment in this Bill to allow for the statutory instrument to be debated in this House.  The Minister should clarify the issues that are being raised at present and should then allow for the enactment of the statutory instrument through the positive approval of the House.The Minister's proposals in respect of consultation on the regulations are highly positive and will clarify many of the issues and concerns expressed by the public.  However, given this consultation will take place and given the Minister's clear view as expressed on Committee Stage regarding the type of regulation he wishes to put in place, he has nothing to fear by including an amendment in this Bill to allow the House to debate the aforementioned statutory instruments and vote approval of them, rather than the current mechanism whereby they must be rescinded within 21 days, which is not an effective tool with which to deal with legislation that can have a far-reaching impact in the short to medium term.Another point in respect of these regulations is that they will deal with the retrofitting standards.  The regulatory impact assessment has shown that in some extreme cases, families could face a cost of up to €17,500 to retrofit their septic tanks.  While the Minister mentioned the issue of grants on Committee Stage, he should clarify for Members that no family will be put under undue financial hardship by any regulations that will be introduced on foot of this legislation.  He should clarify that in such circumstances, grants will be made available to families to prevent them from experiencing financial hardship when addressing such significant costs.  There is strong justification for so doing when one considers the funding that has been put in place for villages, towns and cities to upgrade their sewage treatment facilities and because a significant proportion of the moneys used in this way would revert quickly to the Exchequer through VAT, tax and so on.Another concern with the regulations pertains to the sludge timebomb as I do not believe local authorities have the requisite desludging capacity at present.  First, the frequency with which people will be obliged to desludge their septic tanks is not known.  Similarly, the locations of the desludging treatment facilities are not known but significant transport costs will be incurred in consequence.  It was suggested on Committee Stage that the requisite capacity to deal with sludge is not available in County Galway.  This would mean it would be necessary to transfer such sludge to County Roscommon for treatment and for someone from the west of County Galway, so doing would entail a massive transport cost in addition to the associated treatment cost.The final point I wish to make regarding these regulations is that in many cases, it is feasible for rural householders on those farms on which thousands of euro have been spent to install slatted tanks to divert the effluent from their toilet facilities into the slatted tanks.  This would comply with the current regulations in respect of land spreading and so on because of the dilution factor that is involved.  In his response, the Minister should clarify whether the future regulations could inhibit the possibility of landowners using this mechanism, rather than being obliged to operate what might be substandard septic tanks.  This mechanism would provide a significant solution for many homeowners in rural Ireland, on top of the Minister's commitment to review the group sewerage grant scheme, which in itself would remove a significant cohort of people from the ambit of this Bill.  The Minister should consider this issue and I again urge him either to publish the regulations or to amend the legislation to allow for a positive vote of this House, following a proper and full discussion of the statutory instrument, which would allay a great number of the fears that exist at present.

I believe people will look back in 12 months and will ask what all the fuss was about in this regard.  If I have a criticism of the Minister, it is that he is probably being too responsible and that he should perhaps have directed local authorities to bring forward by-laws similar to those introduced in Cavan in order to address this matter.  If that had occurred, we would not have witnessed the grandstanding and showboating that have taken place in the House on Second Stage and at the Select Sub-Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government on Committee Stage.If a person's roof springs a leak or if a window in his or her house is broken, he or she will, if possible, have it fixed.  If he or she does not possess the financial resources necessary to have it fixed, the State will, in general, provide him or her with assistance in that regard.  Likewise, if someone has a difficulty with his or her septic tank, he or she should, in the first instance, have it repaired.  The ill effects of a defective septic tank are not as tangible as having water flowing down through the ceiling as a result of a leak in the roof.  In the light of this, people will often let the matter pass and not carry out the necessary repairs.I have every confidence that a pragmatic and reasonable approach will be adopted.  I am sure the standard that will be set will relate to whether a septic tank system, regardless of whether it is pre-1900 or pre-1999, actually works.  I am also sure that where people encounter difficulties in getting a defective septic tank back into proper operation, they will be provided with some level of reasonable assistance.  Deputy Denis Naughten referred to farm families, the vast majority of whom have carried out far larger works in recent years than those that will be required in this instance.The legislation may have afforded the members of some semi-dormant political parties an opportunity to stalk the countryside creating fear where it did not exist and masquerade as being interested in solving, rather than adding to, the problem.  The contributions and interjections of Deputies Mattie McGrath and Niall Collins prompted me to wonder whether they were tempted to audition for the new McDonald's advertisement for its eurosaver menu in which the Ireland of the year 2222 is depicted.

If Members want to make positive contributions and address people's concerns, they should do so in a reasonable and fair manner and stop uttering the unnecessary waffle that belittles the institution of the Oireachtas.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	422	To some extent, the moment of truth has arrived.  This problem has been hanging over us since 1975.  Deputy Michelle Mulherin referred to the taking of responsibility.  I certainly do not need any lectures on responsibility in respect of environment which I have spent my life working to protect and improve.  However, I agree with the Deputy that there is a responsibility on Members and all citizens to protect it.  This is the fourth occasion on which Fine Gael's has been in government since 1975, but it has never taken action to solve this problem.  Fianna Fáil was in power for even longer and also failed to take action.  Sinn Féin fully recognises that the problem has been growing and must be dealt with.The Acting Chairman is an urban dweller, but I accept that there might be some septic tanks in his constituency.  I have visited houses-----

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Therefore, the Acting Chairman completely understands the position.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Yes.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	426	It is good that there is someone in the Chamber who knows something about this issue.I wish to provide some background information.  Within the dimensions of the Chamber one could have a house located where the Acting Chairman is sitting, a septic tank located where the Clerk is sitting, a soak pit where the Labour Party Deputies sit and a watercourse at the boundary of the Chamber.  Deputies, particularly those who live in rural areas, will be familiar with systems in which the effluent runs from the house into a septic tank, from which the overflow runs into the soak pit, from which the overflow runs into the watercourse.  Such systems operate to pre-1963 standards, but many of those put in place in the 1980s are similar and I accept action must be taken in respect of them.  However, last year the Minister informed me in this House that once a system worked, it was okay.  One could state a system such as that to which I refer is working.  While it is working, however, it is also giving rise to pollution.We cannot inform people that they will be obliged to upgrade their system and meet the standards that will be set down.  The Minister knows as well as I do that such standards will be stringent.  The Bill proposes the insertion of a new section 70K into the principal Act:70K.—(1) The Agency shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this section, but not later than such date as may be prescribed, make a national plan (in this Part referred to as ‘the national inspection plan') with regard to the inspection and monitoring of domestic waste water treatment systems.(2) When making the national inspection plan, the Agency shall have regard to—(a) relevant risks or potential risks to human health or the environment, and, in particular—(i) risks to water, air or soil, or to plants and animals,(ii) nuisances through noise or odours, and(iii) risks to the countryside or places of special interest,(b) relevant available information in relation to specific types and locations of domestic waste water treatment systems,(c) appropriate and specific qualitative and quantitative criteria, targets and indicators for inspections, and(d) any incidental or ancillary matters or such matters as may be prescribed by the Minister.This is a wide-ranging provision which I will not discuss in detail at this point.  I understand what is envisaged in the Bill must be done.  However, the agency to which the new section refers, namely, the Environmental Protection Agency, will ensure both the legislation and the regulations that will emerge on foot of its enactment will be complied with to the letter.  These are the facts.  The new section 70I states, "The Agency shall supervise a water services authority in the performance of such of its functions as the Agency considers appropriate".

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The Minister has been involved in the political scene longer than I have and a Member of the House for over 30 years.  I am only in the place a wet week.  However, taking a common sense approach, I know what the provisions to which I refer involve.  I am aware of what will be the implications and know how the legislation will be interpreted by the EPA.  If it is to do its job and, as Deputy Michelle Mulherin stated, ensure groundwater is protected from pollution which must be the case, it will be obliged to enforce stringent regulations on foot of what is set out in the legislation.  These are the facts.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	430	The purpose of the amendment tabled by Sinn Féin is to ensure a set of agreed standards for septic tanks and treatment systems to inform the framing of the guidelines would be published.  That is the key point.I was visited at my clinic on Saturday last by a retired garda whose pension was his and his wife's sole source of income.  They built their house on the outskirts of a town in my constituency in the 1970s.  The house is located on a small site and they have had difficulties with their septic tank.  As a result of various factors which I will not outline, the water table in the area has risen and the man in question was obliged to have, with the permission of the landowner, a percolation area outside his site.  Major promises were made to this individual by previous Government Ministers who are no longer Members of the House to the effect that they would resolve the difficulties relating to his septic tank in the context of a Government-sponsored development that was to proceed nearby.  However, this development has been scrapped because there is no money for it.  The husband and wife to whom I refer are, to all intents and purposes, trapped.We must take account of cases such as that I have outlined when passing legislation of this nature.  The people concerned are in their mid-70s.  They do not want to pollute the environment and I do not want them to do so.  We must consider the position of people like them.  We must also clearly outline the standards that will apply and put in place a system of grants in order that those who need to carry out works will be provided with assistance.  Successive Governments have engaged in a fudge in respect of this matter since 1975.  I know the party of which I am a member is criticised for many things.  Nonetheless, it believes in trying to solve problems.  We are at last trying to find a solution to the problem of septic tanks and all I am asking is that the Minister be up front in respect of the standards that will apply and cater for the needs of the elderly couple to whom I refer and others like them.  We should put in place a scheme of grants-----

However, I must proceed to call Deputy Martin Ferris.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I thank the Acting Chairman for granting me some latitude.

Deputy Brian Stanley has outlined Sinn Féin's position.  We take this matter seriously and are absolutely committed to ensuring the protection of waterways, etc.  However, we have serious concerns about the legislation in terms of its ambiguity, particularly in respect of the standards that are to apply.  We do not know what will be the nature of these standards.  The legislation will be passed tomorrow and the relevant people will then try to figure out what it involves.A comment was made about these public meetings that I attended, along with Deputies Healy Rae, McGrath, Collins and many others around the country, and that we were scaremongering and putting out misinformation.  At any meeting I attended and at any meeting organised by Sinn Féin, all we did was deal with the legislation and its implications.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I have evidence.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I can say that we had a legal person there to go through the content of the legislation.  It was done absolutely accurately.  What is in the legislation is quite frightening.  It is the implementation of the legislation and the standards being put forward by the Minister that people are examining.  That is what we need to see.I am aware of single rural cottages put in by the county councils.  I worked on the buildings one time doing subfloors and foundations.  I have seen county councils putting in single rural cottages.  They put in the septic tank without any soakaway, and the overflow in the septic tank goes straight into the drainage and by extension, into the watercourse.  There is no hope of percolation in such cases, so that is a huge problem.  I know of other houses built with 65 feet frontage, so they have no hope whatsoever to keep the soakaway and the septic tank away from the boundaries.  I am aware of septic tanks and soakaways put in to adjoining property because the site was too small.  I remember quarter acre sites going back to the 1960s, perhaps even smaller.  These will cause huge problems.  There are fears out there and we are only articulating them here.Comments were made about the registration fee.  I would not care if it cost nothing, not to mind €20.  It is all there.  Every person who got planning permission since 1975 is registered with their respective county councils.  I go back regularly for people to check things out.  The big issue is the cost factor.  I accept that remedial works have to be carried out, but if people were compliant with the standards applicable in their day but now they find for whatever reason they are not compliant with new standards to be published by the Minister, this means they will have to spend a lot of money to get it right.  Is the Minister telling me that if there is no percolation, people will not have to spend money?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Wait and see.

I know people who have upgraded their sewerage systems.  I know people who got planning permission on a half acre site 20 years ago and people who got permission on the site next to it 20 years later, and they could not get percolation.  I know people refused planning permission next door to those who got it, because they could not get percolation.  All of these issues are out there and that is why people are afraid.  That is why people need to have the facts.  They need these things to be explained in great detail and they need to see the standards.We are being asked here to accept the legislation without knowing the standards.  We need to know that.  For any remedial works that will be carried out, the Minister should give a firm commitment in this House that the Department will fund them.

We had a vigorous and a mostly positive discussion for approximately eight hours.  I compliment the people who contributed to it and acknowledge the positive contributions made by Deputy Collins, Deputy Ó Cuív and Deputy Stanley.  I particularly acknowledge their contribution because they succeeded with amendments that were brought forward.  I also compliment the Minister because there was compromise and give and take, and I have no doubt that the Bill will be much better as a result of that.  I hope this continues today.I would like to correct some inaccuracies and statements made by Deputy McGrath about my chairing of Committee Stage.  I would like to point out the facts, because I do not want to be misrepresented.  At that meeting, a total of 13 amendments were ruled out of order, nine of which were due to a charge to Revenue.  Deputy McGrath said that all-----

First, Deputy McGrath had no amendments down that day.  However, he was associated with two amendments that were ruled out of order in the name of Deputy Catherine Murphy; not over 30, not several, just two.  Second, Deputy McGrath went on public radio to say that I steamrolled the meeting and did this, that and the other.  I will leave it up to the other committee members to decide that.Amendment No.77 in the name of the Minister was accepted that day, and it sought to reduce the charge from €200 to €20.  Deputy McGrath wanted the charge held at €200.  At that meeting, he also wanted a €15 million fine imposed on South Tipperary County Council.

These are the facts of that meeting and I will leave it up to committee members to decide.  The amendments are here and I am leaving an official copy of what we dealt with on that day.  We succeeded in eight hours in making substantial changes and corrections to the Bill.There are many positive things in this Bill.  Is it accurate to state that there is an opportunity here for people who have difficulties with sites and septic tanks, perhaps due to the size of the site or percolation problems?  When this Bill is enacted, they will not require planning permission now.  If these problems are discovered on inspection, they will have an opportunity to remedy them, something that could not happen were it not for the Bill.Sludge is now becoming a very valuable commodity when we look at the proposals that are about to take off for anaerobic digestion.  This will provide an opportunity for people and I cannot understand why Deputy McGrath is running scared of sludge when there are so many positive proposals to establish anaerobic digestion plants in his constituency.I have outlined a typical example of how, even in this Chamber, Deputy McGrath comes in to misinform people who have the facts in front of them.  Can the Acting Chairman imagine the misinformation the Deputy is spreading around the country?  In respect of the 800 or so people he claims have turned up at meetings - that is totally exaggerated - I have met many people who said they went along for the entertainment.  They wanted to see the comedy act that was being provided by Deputy McGrath.  They are waiting to see-----

I could respond to many things that are not in the amendment, but I will respond to the amendment first.The reason we are here with this Bill is to comply with a European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland which was lost in October 2009.  My predecessors in government failed to win a case in the European Court of Justice and it had legal and other advice available to it.

Otherwise we would be paying a fine of €26,000 a day or an annual fee of €9.7 million.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The renewed programme for Government agreed on 10 October 2009, agreed to by Deputy Mattie McGrath and Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's father, included a commitment to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of septic tanks and wastewater treatment systems.  On 29 October 2009 the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland and we had to introduce a system.  The previous Government agreed that the legal obligation on Ireland required new legislation to be brought forward to provide for the setting of standards for the operation and performance of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems and the monitoring and inspection of the performance of such treatment systems.  It agreed that to address the ruling it would be necessary to bring forward legislation to provide for the setting of standards for the operation of septic tanks, particularly older systems.  It also agreed that legislation would be required to provide for the monitoring and inspection of the performance of such treatment systems and set out the responsibilities of all householders served by these systems, including requirements to carry out remedial actions, where necessary, without cost to the Exchequer.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Now.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	459	According to the previous Government, without prejudging the final shape of the monitoring and inspection regime, it was likely to include a requirement for householders to allow access to their on-site wastewater systems to ensure they were being operated and maintained correctly; the frequency with which these assessments were to be carried out would also be detailed; households would be required to take immediate action if considered necessary to bring their systems up to the required standard; the timelines within which such works should be undertaken would be set out; the details of any offences or penalties for non-compliance would be included; and a supervisory system to ensure assessors could carry out assessments fairly and consistently would be introduced.According to the previous Government, one critical element of the ruling was related to the establishment of performance standards for all on-site wastewater systems.  A subgroup of the task force comprising professional and technical experts from the EPA, the Department and local authorities examined this issue and prepared a draft standards document to finalise the performance standards to be applied.  To inform the drafting of the legislation to fully comply with the ruling of the European Court of Justice, consultation with key stakeholders commenced on 19 October 2010 and local authorities were to be included in the consultation process.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was 26 November 2010.There is a lot of hypocrisy today, particularly when I consider what I have been landed with because of the inactivity of the previous Government and what it was prepared to do.  I do not know where or on what planet the Deputies have been.  Perhaps they were not aware of this.

However, the ECJ ruling highlights a deficiency in our legislation, namely that we have systems in place to ensure risks to public health and the environment are avoided.  I want to stress the word "risk".  The legislation will focus on the risks and ensure any risks are avoided because even though our water quality is very good, the risks to public health if a drinking water source is contaminated are extreme.Deputy Stanley spoke about standards, and we know what they are in Northern Ireland.  I am surprised the Deputy, and Deputy Ferris, does not mention more frequently what is happening in Northern Ireland.

I had to put up with all that scaremongering for the three and a half years I was a backbencher and the 12 months I was an Independent but that is neither here nor there.  The Minister asked us to be generous, accept this Bill and he will give us the standards but he is now telling us that they have already discussed the standards and we will have consultation after the fact.  Who is he trying to cod?Regarding Deputy Coonan, I did not criticise his chairing of the meeting last week.  I had 32 amendments down through Deputy Catherine Murphy because she is the only member of my group on the committee.  We had to operate that way.  I had approximately 12 amendments ruled out of order because of this ridiculous clause that they cannot be moved because they would impose a cost on the Exchequer.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	617	It is about the amount and the standards.  I received this letter on 10 January 2012.  I read the letter into the record of the committee last week and asked the Minister to do something about it but I did not get an answer from either the Chairman or the committee.  The letter states:Dear SirI heard you speak on radio.  My septic tank was registered in 1973 when a man from the Environment examined same for a grant of £25.

This is a sensitive matter.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw that remark.  I am about to read out this person's name.  The Acting Chairman should not accept that.

My 2 1/2 year old little boy was drowned in it that evening.I could go on & on.  No satisfaction from the state.Yours sincerelyI will read his name into the record because he asked me to do so.  It is Declan Cronin.  He further stated:Dear SirYou have my full permission to broadcast or publish this matter all over the country any way you want.

These are the fears people have about this legislation.  There have been Ministers in the Department since then, and I am not blaming him for that, but he is the Minister now.  He is the strong man they tell us about who the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, praised the other day.  He said the best Minister we have is Deputy Phil Hogan who can drive the household charge legislation and this Bill through the House.  It is a case of to hell with the people - to hell or to Connacht.  I ask the Minister to be honest and fair.  He is telling us we will have legislation next week and that there will be consultation after the fact.  I ask him to take a copy of the letter I read out and try to deal with it?Deputy Coonan wants to interrupt me but I had tabled amendments in good faith.  I did not come in here shouting and roaring.  I had amendments down.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  It is obvious he is wedded to the current position and will not clarify the standards that are required.  That is unacceptable.  It is reasonable and common sense that before Members of this House vote on any legislation we should know exactly what it contains.  It is reasonable and common sense that the members of the public who are affected by the legislation should be aware of the position also.  It appears there is a deliberate attempt to fudge the standards and allow for a situation whereby people will be affected by this legislation down the road, so to speak, in terms of the introduction of the most up to date standards.   A significant number of people will find themselves in a position where remedial works will have to be carried out to their systems.In recent years quite a number of treatment systems have been put in place in cities and towns, as the Minister mentioned.  That is being funded mainly through general taxation.  Rural dwellers who have septic tanks have contributed through general taxation to the remedial works and the upgrading of systems in villages, towns and cities.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The role of Government is not to create jobs directly but to create the appropriate business environment by making the right policy decisions to help enterprise to grow, to create new jobs and to maintain existing jobs.  In the wake of many years of unsustainable policies that produced an  oversized construction sector, a property bubble, a collapse in the public finances, and years of declining share in export markets, the challenge we face now is to totally transform our economy.  This will be a difficult transition, particularly in the face of declining international growth.  There is a great deal of restructuring and reform required to enhance the capability of enterprises to create employment.However, since I came into office, I have been working with my Government colleagues to achieve this objective.  We launched a jobs initiative last May, within two months of the Government coming into office, to stimulate domestic demand and restore confidence in the economy internationally.Key areas which I have been working on since then to support job creation by enterprise include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance and supporting innovation.  I have also been co-ordinating the preparation of the first annual action plan for jobs on behalf of the Government, which will outline the measures to be taken across a range of Departments to support job creation in 2012.Significant progress is being made in spite of the continued difficult economic conditions which pertain globally.  Last year, in spite of a continued suppressed global market, IDA Ireland supported the creation of more than 13,000 new jobs in client companies, an increase of 20% on the previous year's figures.  The agency won a record 148 new investments in 2011, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  The IDA has also made a further four announcements to date in 2012, which will create an additional 332 jobs in client companies and support a further 250 indirect construction jobs.Enterprise Ireland reported that employment in client companies stabilised in 2011, with 141,228 full-time employees, similar to 2010.  The agency has also been able to announce the creation of 337 new jobs in client companies since the start of the year.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Enterprise Ireland also estimates that client companies' export sales last year will exceed the pre-recession record levels of 2008.  The CSO's latest trade figures show that, up to November 2011, Irish exports overall increased by 4% compared with the same period in 2010, to in excess of €69 billion.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I heard the Minister talk about the past but we are in the present now and he is a member of a Government which has been given an overwhelming majority by the people as a result of putting forward a policy, the centrepiece of which was to create jobs.  The average rate of unemployment in the past 12 months during which the Government has been in office is 14.2%, as opposed to 13.7% the year before and 11.8% the year before that.  There are now more than 443,000 people officially unemployed, with more than half of them being unemployed for more than a year.  That is approximately the same figure as at the start of the year.  According to the best estimate, at least 77,000 people have emigrated during the past 12 months.  I presume most of them were not just going off to see the rest of the world but left to seek work.  That amounts to 200 people emigrating per day and there are 443,000 on the live register.  In view of those figures, does the Minister consider his jobs initiative introduced last May was a success?The Minister is about to announce a new jobs initiative.  It is a case of another year, another jobs initiative.  What new ideas does he propose to put forward in that next initiative that will succeed where the last one obviously failed?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The truth of it is that it will take painstaking work.  We have had to restructure the banks to put them in a position where they can once again lend to small businesses.As I said in my reply, we have had successes in the past 12 months, despite the Deputy's unwillingness to recognise them.  For example, in the food sector we have had the best year ever with 14% growth in food exports.  That is a sector which clearly has huge connections back into the Irish economy.  Its impact on farming and on food processing is enormous.  Therefore, there are successes.There are, however, continuing difficulties in some sectors about which we know.  Our banking sector, unfortunately, got trapped into a lot of property dealing and that sort of banking no longer exists.  As I said in my reply, there is painstaking work to be done.As to whether the initiative made an impact, it has.  Cutting employer's PRSI and cutting the low rate of VAT has secured an increase of 6,000 in the number of people in the tourism sector.  Therefore, the initiative is working.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Not one net job has been created during the past 12 months that the Government has been in office.  The reality is that unemployment is literally at the same point it was at the start of the year.I have two simple questions for the Minister.  First, can he give those who are unemployed and who are emigrating any succour by indicating whether he thinks if we are sitting here in the same position this time next year, that unemployment will have fallen?  Second, in regard to the financial services sector, of which he has plenty advance notice that there will be a massive fall-out in terms of employment, has he done any advance planning to address that because it is imminent?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	633	A plan was launched last year by the Taoiseach, as the Deputy may know, in respect of the potential for growth in the financial services sector.  It is expected that the financial services sector has the capacity to create 10,000 additional jobs in the foreseeable future.  Therefore, there is planning.Obviously, there are other parts of banking that we know about in light of the recent announcement by some of the banks where there will be a decline and there is a need to support a transfer to the new opportunities.  Some of that will involve reskilling.  Part of the jobs initiative, of which the Deputy is so critical, included Springboard, a specific initiative aimed at people who have lost their jobs in one sector to reskill and transfer to others.  There is a good deal of rebuilding to be done to transform this economy successfully into a strong export-led recovery, but that work is being done and we will see the fruits of that.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, this Government has been working to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  Our objective is to put the country back on the road to economic recovery and full employment.It is an unfortunate reality that companies, for a wide range of reasons, get into difficulty.  Early intervention is critical and that intervention must, where possible, occur before the situation is irretrievable.  For this reason the enterprise agencies operate an early warning system which triggers the full capacity of the agency concerned to intervene with the company and deal with whatever situation is emerging.   I am satisfied this system works well but I will continue to keep it under review to best serve the companies concerned.Clearly, prevention is better than cure and this is why the enterprise agencies work closely with their client companies in order that strategic interventions can be taken that avoid the company getting into difficulty in the first instance.  These interventions help clients make the strategic and operational changes that will retain their competitive position in a rapidly changing global environment.  Depending on the company's need, changes can include skills uplift, technology uplift, process improvements such as lean manufacturing, energy efficiency and better logistical management, supports for in-house research and innovation activity, management development such as the leadership for growth programme, assisting a company entering new or emerging geographical markets, support for clients' strategic finance capabilities, access to mentors and so on.The enterprise agencies work closely with other Departments and partner development agencies to respond to specific incidences where larger companies suffer a significant job losses or where a significant number of jobs are at risk.  The objective in these circumstances is to identify all opportunities to maximise the number of jobs maintained, for example, through support for spin-out start-ups, management buy-outs or commercial partnering.  Task forces comprising relevant personnel from the Departments and agencies and other key stakeholders are used in these cases.

Many small businesses are facing particularly difficult trading conditions.  A number of initiatives have been taken to help them.  The low rate of PRSI has been halved.  The county enterprise boards have also recently introduced a financial health check, reporting and benchmarking tool, in association with Enterprise Ireland lean manufacturing, to help small business assess their difficulties.The Government has intervened to help businesses who are struggling to get credit.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for 2012 and 2013.  Businesses having difficulty with credit refusals can use the services of the Credit Review Office which will carry out an independent and impartial review of a bank's decision to refuse or reduce credit.The economy is undergoing a difficult transformation.  Some sectors grew to a scale that was unsustainable.  Part of the challenge for Government is to help people move into new sectors of opportunity.  In the context of the action plan for jobs, we are looking at other ways in which business can be assisted in overcoming difficulties.

There were €20 million worth of new job creation ideas in the last budget but 150 times that amount is going into bailing out the banks.  The Government's priority is the inverse of what the Minister says.  Its priority is the opposite of job creation.  The Government is prioritising the bailing out of banks.There is an avalanche of businesses within the system that are at the edge of viability.  Many of these will be forced to close over the next number of months and years.  The corporate and sovereignty figures show that 1,683 businesses closed last year, up 16% from 2009, with construction, retail and hospitality bearing the brunt of this.  In my home town, Spicers Bakery was on the go for 180 years.  It has had to let go 27 employees, with the remaining 20 employees hanging by a thread.  When I called the Minister's office and asked that he engage with Spicers Bakery, I was told by an official that the bakery was not a client company of Enterprise Ireland or the IDA and that there was no mechanism to engage with the business, even though it is a manufacturing business.Given that so many jobs are hanging by a thread and that enterprise agencies engage with small new start-ups, why is there not an agency within the Department that would engage with all types of businesses before they come to the final stage of not being viable and being forced to lay off staff?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The reason for that is that we have agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland which specialises in the support of indigenous companies and IDA which specialises in the support of foreign owned companies who come to locate here.  They have the competitive advantage within the State system of understanding the needs of those businesses.  To suggest, as the Deputy is doing, that we create a new agency to pick up casualties within the Enterprise Ireland or IDA brief does not make sense.  We need to ensure that Enterprise Ireland, IDA and, where appropriate, county enterprise boards have the advance knowledge - the early warning system I spoke of - and supporting instruments.  A business must come forward with a credible business plan before it can draw down support from these agencies in terms of rebuilding its economy.The Deputy suggests that the budget is anti-jobs.  The whole thrust of what the Minister for Finance has done is pro-jobs.  He cut the VAT and PRSI rates, improved the research and development tax credit, gave small start-ups three years free of taxation and reformed the seed capital scheme so that people who want to start up a business can draw down up to €600,000 of the tax they paid in previous years to establish a new business.  It is all about trying to drive new enterprises to grow and develop.We are in a difficult financial area, and everyone understands that, but the measures being taken are trying, against that background, to maximise the chances for growth.

The Government's policies are hollow.  They are merely tinkering around the edges.  The cost of each additional person on social welfare is €20,000.  I have given the Minister an example of a business with which the Department and the enterprise agencies are not engaging.  Many business people who are in the same situation will read the text of today's debate and ask where the Department was when their businesses were teetering on the edge.  If the agencies currently working in this area are carrying out these roles why have their remits not been broadened to include all businesses that are teetering on the edge?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The economy is undergoing a difficult transformation.  Some sectors grew to a scale that is not sustainable.  As the Deputy knows, the construction sector grew to unsustainable levels.  The task of Government is to help companies that have a viable future to create that future, but we must also look at companies that are not able to survive in their present form but can be helped to establish new spin-off business.  We have seen many such companies being successful.  Recently we had the very difficult experience in Waterford where a company, for all sorts of reasons that we know about, closed down.  We have been working to try to redevelop that and we now have an indigenous enterprise, driven by Waterford-based people setting up a leading edge company and using many of the existing talents.  That company has a strong future.In some cases a transition has to happen.  That is what we are seeking to support.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14294	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	639	There are no proposals to introduce a Government guaranteed export credit insurance scheme for Irish exporters to these countries.  The Government's position on this issue has been informed by the findings of the 2009 report commissioned by my Department from KPMG consultants.  That report established that the introduction of such a scheme would be expensive, with significant ongoing costs arising for the State.  Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention in the export credit market would be about €1.7 million, and this cost would rise significantly if higher risk profile exports were covered.  In addition, it was found that such a scheme would be of very limited impact and that a negligible number of jobs could be connected with such an initiative.Under EU state aid rules, any such state scheme is not normally permissible for short-term credit insurance.  Most Irish exports fall into this category.  A temporary derogation was established in 2009 due to the financial crisis at that time.  That is now under review and is very unlikely to be maintained.  Even under this current exemption, the specific provisions of any scheme must be approved by the European Commission.  Approval would include a condition that the level of insurance premia to be paid by companies should be higher than rates provided in the open market.  This is a considerable deterrent to business, and some of the schemes introduced by other member states had poor uptake for this reason.In the intervening two years, there has been an improvement in the market for short-term export credit insurance.  Insurers have recovered their capacity for risk and the market has recovered significantly, with both new entrants to the market and new products being offered.  This has greatly improved the availability of export credit insurance on the commercial market.The publication of the detailed KPMG report is not possible.  The forensic analysis on the operation of the market for this type of insurance was only possible through the provision of sensitive, confidential data and detailed company specific information to KPMG.  This information was provided to KPMG on the condition of strict confidentiality.  Given the commercial sensitivity of this material and the limited number of companies in the market, both KPMG and the Department signed legally binding agreements with the insurers that the information provided would not be released.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House.
While the background research and analytical elements of the KPMG report cannot therefore be released, the key overall findings were publicised at the time and supported the view that a State supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.  This remains the position but will be kept under ongoing review, including in light of advice and evidence from the appropriate agencies and business representative groups.  As the Government has a responsibility to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, a commitment of large-scale funding to an initiative with marginal benefits for Irish industry and high level risks to the State would be unwise.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	640	In our dealings with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - the BRICS countries - we do not have the natural advantage of the kind of relationship we enjoy with Britain, America or Australia, where there are large Irish communities.  If we are to achieve the growth rates the Taoiseach talked about today, we must go outside our traditional markets.It is disappointing that we cannot see the report.  Can any element of the report be released?  It would be very useful for us to see the benefit of the measure.There are, possibly, opportunities that are eluding us.  For example, at the end of February we will face both a threat and an opportunity.  The threat is to our public services.  There is also an opportunity in the 7,500 people who will be receiving a lump sum payment.  Why do we not look at scenarios where there may well be opportunities for people to invest in a jobs-led initiative where there would be a guaranteed return on their money?  The State must be involved.  This is the kind of public private partnership that is worth exploring.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether part of the KPMG report might be released?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14294	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  The strict confidentiality clause, which was one of the conditions that applied when people gave information during the compilation of that report, should be respected.  We can provide the Deputy with the information that is available from Enterprise Ireland about export figures and the opportunities that are arising in the BRIC countries.  The Deputy also asked about investment in jobs and the opportunities that will arise after February.  A great deal of work is ongoing at Government level to compile the new action plan for jobs.  More lateral themes are being explored as we do that.  I hope the Deputy will take in good faith my assurance that we are trying to explore and mine as many opportunities as we can.  I say that in response to the point she made about job creation.  If I understood the point the Deputy was making correctly, she said we should avail of the intellectual capacity of people who will find themselves in a new situation after February of this year.  The State needs to provide opportunities to such people, or engage with them at least.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Almost 7,500 people will leave the public service with a lump sum payment in the coming weeks.  A substantial number of them will be looking for a safe place to put their money.  We are aware that a substantial amount of money is being saved in this country.  The patriotism that is out there can be exploited if there is a prospect of a guaranteed return on an investment in this country that delivers jobs.  It is the kind of thing that remains untapped.  The point I was making was that a safe location is needed.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14294	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I take the Deputy's point.  The private investment decisions of an individual are matters for the individual in question.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	644	Absolutely.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14294	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I take the point that was made about finding a vehicle for a lump-sum investment.  I respectfully suggest the Deputy should engage with the Minister for Finance with a view to exploring possibilities in that area.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The full details of our trade balance are set out in the tables that follow this reply.  Complete data for 2011 are not yet available.  In summary, Ireland's trade balance with the UK improved from a deficit of €385 million in 2007 to a surplus of €3,009 million in 2010.  The trade balance with BRIC countries improved from a deficit of €923 million in 2007 to a surplus of €2,714 million in 2010.  A trade surplus of approximately €27 billion prevailed with the rest of the EU throughout the period from 2007 to 2010.  The trade balance with the rest of the world improved from a deficit of €2,940 million in 2007 to a surplus of €7,853 million in 2010.  The indications for 2011 are that exports will continue to grow in these markets, outstripping import growth in each case.The strong growth of net exports has helped make a crucial and positive contribution to this country's GDP.  This is especially important because some other components of economic growth have been negative.  The latest Government forecast for export growth in 2012 is 3.6% and in 2013 is 4.5%.  Our export performance has been very impressive.  Following the fall in exports during the worst years of the recession, they have rebounded.  When the final data for 2011 are published, it is expected that a modest increase will have been achieved despite the economic difficulties in some of our key markets.  Furthermore, volume trends have been particularly good as we have become relatively cheaper in many markets.  The strong performance of the food sector, with its deep links to the wider economy and indigenous firms in particular, has been a positive feature of our export recovery.I am confident that our exporting momentum will be maintained for the coming years, subject to conditions not deteriorating in the world economy.  Exports from Enterprise Ireland clients, which cover much of the indigenous exporting sector, are likely to reach or exceed €14.6 billion for 2011, which represents an increase of approximately 5%.  If there is reasonable stability in global markets, these exports could expand by approximately 5% again this year.  The Government is committed to supporting export growth in every possible way.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I am trying to assimilate the host of figures the Minister has given the House.  I cannot get my head around them just yet.  An overall trade surplus has been projected for 2012.  What increase does this represent on the trade surplus for last year?  One of the many figures the Minister mentioned was the projected increase of 3.6% in exports next year.  Is that correct?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	648	Yes.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	650	Unfortunately, the way the Deputy asked the question means that a simple aggregate figure has not been provided.  Our trade surplus with the UK increased from €2.8 billion to €3 billion from 2009 to 2010.  Our trade surplus with the BRIC countries increased from €1.99 billion to €2.7 billion over the same period.  Our trade surplus with the EU decreased slightly from €26.5 billion to €25.5 billion over that period.  Our trade surplus with the rest of the world increased substantially from €1.8 billion to €7.8 billion over that time.  I do not have an aggregate figure.  The trends are healthy.  Overall, we will have a balance of payments surplus.  As a nation, we will be paying back our indebtedness.  Of course there are different views about the projected levels of growth that will be necessary if the budgetary targets are to be delivered.  Although the troika is expecting a downgrading of growth figures in the wake of its recent visit, it is confident that the Irish fiscal plan is set to meet the target that has been set for it.  These matters will be monitored carefully by the Minister for Finance.  It is not an issue for me directly.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	651	Does the Minister agree that we continue to rely heavily on traditional markets, like the United States and the rest of Europe?  Can he indicate what percentage of our total exports went to the BRIC countries last year?  How did that compare to the equivalent percentage the previous year?  Can the Minister confirm that the increase in Irish exports to the BRIC countries last year was approximately 4%, which compares very unfavourably to the average increase of 22.5% that was achieved across the 27 EU member states?

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	653	Yes.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	654	There has been an increase in our trade to the four BRIC countries.  The Deputy's point is right, overall.  Even though over a four-year period there has been a 50% increase in trade to the BRIC countries, as a proportion of our overall trade, it continues to be modest.  One of the ambitions that was set in the programme for Government was to build on our efforts in this area.  To be fair, it was also a target of the previous Administration, of which Deputy O'Dea was a part.  We are putting more feet on the ground in such countries.  The Minister for Finance recently introduced a tax concession to encourage people to place marketing workers in these countries.  They will get a tax concession for that.  We need to have a long-term commitment to these markets.  It is recognised that if we are to increase these figures significantly, we will have to target companies that are willing to make such a commitment.  That is why the Minister has offered this tax break.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The European progress microfinance facility is a European Investment Fund initiative to support entrepreneurship and employment through microfinance activities.  The European Investment Fund does not provide direct financing for micro-entrepreneurs, micro-businesses or individuals.  Financing is made available through intermediaries participating in the facility.  Eligible intermediaries are any public and private institutions which provide microfinance loans and-or guarantees for individuals or micro-enterprises established in EU member states.  The European Investment Fund provides selected intermediaries with capped guarantees partially covering their portfolios of micro-loans or guarantees on micro-loans granted to micro-enterprises.I am developing a microfinance loan fund to provide loans for sustainable micro-enterprises.  It is targeted at start-up, newly established or growing micro-enterprises across all industry sectors employing not more than ten people.  It will provide loans of up to €25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks.My Department has had discussions with the European Investment Fund to explore the possibilities of access to the progress microfinance facility fund when established.  Applications for participation do not require State involvement.  To apply to become an intermediary, interested institutions must submit a formal application directly to the European Investment Fund.  Applications can be made until 31 December 2013.The Government recently approved the allocation of €10 million as seed capital for the fund.  It is anticipated that the fund will supplement this seed capital by leveraging further funding from private sources, including the banks.  I am developing the structure of the microfinance facility to be established early this year.  The matter will be pursued further with the European Investment Fund at that stage.

The Government has announced a microfinance fund on a number of occasions, yet nothing has happened.  The Minister of State indicated how the finance system would work, but the initial budget was to be €100 million which it was viewed would leverage a figure of up €500 million.  This would enable institutions in EU countries to channel funding to businesses by means of a guarantee for institutions funnelling the money.  This facility was created last March.  How much money has the Government or the institutions drawn down to date from the fund and when will the microfinance plan see the light of day
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	657	This is the first time the State has provided a microfinance loan facility.  The initial fund will be €10 million which it is hoped will leverage further funding from banks and other private bodies.  The Government has consulted relevant stakeholders and legislation will be required.  The key to the success of the facility will be local involvement through the county enterprise boards or the BIT network which is heavily funded by the Department to the tune of €2.2 million.  Involvement by First Step is crucial to the viability of all small companies.  There must be due diligence prior to funding small companies.  It is not just a matter of giving out loans; management skills, mentoring and development of the company must be taken into account.  It is not a matter of giving it initial funding in the hope it will become profitable.  Many companies can be made better even without being in receipt of funding.  This is the first time the State has become involved in this worthwhile fund.  The previous Government talked about it for a long period.  We are in the final stages and the fund will announced within a short time.

The European Investment Fund programme has been open for tenders on its website since last March.  How much of the funding has the Government drawn down to date?  This is a serious consideration and the failure to answer the question shows a deep disrespect for the 180,000 businesses mentioned, of which ISME estimates 50% are struggling to secure finance.  The world and its mother knows that credit is frozen and that this is damaging the economy.  I want to know how much has been drawn down to date.

As the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has correctly stated, the exports of Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia supported companies are the highest on record.  We have met the two pillar banks and viable businesses are receiving funding, despite what the Deputy says.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 15, 31 and 45 together.The number of cases that have arisen in recent times of companies becoming insolvent and not engaging in timely and adequate dialogue with their employees is regrettable.  I fully understand the pressures companies are under, but this should not be an excuse for treating employees shabbily.There are various legislative protections in place in both my Department and the Department of Social Protection to protect employees in situations such as those that have arisen in recent weeks.  The arrangements in place offer comprehensive protections, but as recent events have clearly indicated, they require the willingness of all parties to ensure legal obligations are discharged.  The Protection of Employment Act 1977, as amended, makes it mandatory for employers proposing a collective redundancy to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and provide certain information on the proposed redundancies.  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory employee information and consultation period.The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2001 make it mandatory for employers to provide a minimum period of notice in advance of any dismissal for employees with at least 13 weeks service.  The notice period ranges in scale from one week to eight weeks, depending on the number of years of service.  The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that most employees are entitled to four weeks annual holidays for each leave year with pro rata entitlements for periods of employment of less than one year.  The redundancy payment legislation, administered by the Department of Social Protection, obliges employers to pay a statutory redundancy lump sum to eligible employees.  Where an employer is unable or unwilling to pay, the Department of Social Protection has provision to make a payment from the social insurance fund.  The insolvency funds also provide for claims that follow the failure of an employer, for reasons of insolvency, to make payments to employees that are properly due.  These include payments in respect of such categories as arrears of wages due, holiday pay entitlement, pension contributions, etc.Where workers believe their rights under legislation have not been respected by their employer, they have a right to pursue their complaint before the Rights Commissioners or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.  Where disputes arise between workers and employers, the Labour Relations Commission can assist with dispute resolution services.  The LRC has a very strong record of brokering solutions in many cases.  However, not all situations are amenable to being resolved through conciliation.  We must remember that the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  Recent developments have given us all cause for concern and my Department is monitoring developments in close consultation with the LRC.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	670	The Minister's answer is not good enough.  He has merely outlined the status quo and the backdrop against which the scandalous decisions have been made by employers to leave workers with nothing, without notice of closures which are sprung on them deliberately to evade the making of statutory redundancy payments.  This is happening within the legislative framework outlined by the Minister, which clearly shows that systems and the level of enforcement are inadequate.  There is an onus on the Minister to look further.The question asked what action the Minister would take, and there are a number of measures on which I would like the Minister to comment.  The only way workers can meet the threat when closure is sprung on them is by occupying the place of work.  Although it did not happen in Vita Cortex and La Senza, when workers occupied the place of work in Thomas Cook, they were dragged out.  There should be a provision in these instances where workers could be given legal immunity.  That is particularly relevant where people have given all their adult lives working in a particular place.  Will the Minister comment on that?Such people should be entitled to examine the books and the financial claims being made by employers, such as Vita Cortex's Jack Ronan, who say they have no money when everybody knows they have.  Organisations such as KPMG represented La Senza in breaching legislation and avoiding statutory provisions, and they have been employed by Departments, which should not happen.  The last issue is in the area of enforcement, for which the Minister's Department is responsible, and measures for staffing adequately the Employment Appeals Tribunal and other organisations.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I appeal to Members to make questions and replies short.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The various agencies and supports that have been outlined have been active in some of these disputes, and in some cases there have been successful resolutions, as the Deputy probably knows.  There is active discussion ongoing in some cases, with SIPTU involved with the Labour Relations Commission and a proposal being put.  In another of the cases, following discussions between Mandate and KPMG, the administrator, the outstanding moneys are being paid, with workers getting their entitlements.  Portraying the issue as if the system is simply not working should not be the case.  There have been cases that any of us would regard as not the way business should be done, and for instance, there may not have been sufficient notice.  The agencies I outlined in my reply are taking action and achieving success in some cases.  With other cases the disputes are proving particularly difficult.Employers are under an obligation to give statutory notice and there are legal enforcement powers if there is a failure to do so.  Those powers remain available.  We have a system of voluntary industrial relations, with experienced machinery to help both sides reach conclusions.  We allow those to work through but there are reserve powers; for example, in the case of redundancy, the Minister for Social Protection would pursue an employer to recover, on behalf of the taxpayer, moneys that may have been paid.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	673	I know the Minister has engaged in a hands-on way with the two companies mentioned but I will bring his attention to another case.  He mentioned the responsibility of employers and the usefulness of the labour relations machinery.  In my constituency, there was an employer that was, effectively, the State.  This relates to St. Enda's Sports Complex in Limerick, which went out of business.  The employees had not been paid redundancy and took the employer to the Labour Court last May, and the court's recommendation was that the employees be paid because the redundancy happened because of the withdrawal of funding by a Department.  The Department of Education and Skills informed me the money had been put aside to pay the business but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has refused to allow the money to be paid.  We are talking about 28 workers and a grand total of €80,000, which is an infinitesimal amount of money when we consider what bondholders are being paid.  A Department is liable for this €80,000 but the State is refusing to honour a recommendation of the Labour Court.  Will the Minister investigate that and revert to me?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I do not know of the case.  From the Deputy's statement, it sounds like the case has gone through the agencies for which I am responsible.  At this point it is an issue in respect of honouring a recommendation.  I will seek information on behalf of the Deputy but it is not available to me at the moment.

#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I refer specifically to the La Senza workers, and I know those who found themselves in a vulnerable position would like to express a sincere thanks to all those who provided support during the time in which they were in a very vulnerable and difficult position.  I acknowledge the role of Mandate in those circumstances, although I was particularly disappointed with the role of IBEC, which could have been far more supportive.Will the Minister consider introducing a dedicated section of the labour relations system that might respond if there is a repeat of these events, as people suggest is likely to happen again because of recent trends?  I know the Government is making every effort to create jobs but we must be mindful as a Dáil and Parliament of the people who are in employment and who find themselves in a very vulnerable position.  We have seen far too many cases of this recently.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I would be advised by the Labour Relations Commission, which is the body with experience in this sphere.  It is a very hands-on agency and it is not a question of allocating a particular section to work on this.  It is every man to the pumps in these cases and from the chief executive down its best effort is put into finding a solution.  Sometimes it is not possible to bring about a solution and sometimes it is, as was the case with Lagan Brick, as the intervention seems to have been successful.  Unfortunately, the intervention so far with Vita Cortex has not been successful.  It is not an issue of finding a new section or hiving off an area in this regard.I share the Deputy's concern as this is a worrying trend and we need to get both sides to understand their responsibilities.  We should not see such disputes reach this stage.  On another side I am trying to improve the operation of the employee relations and industrial relations machinery to co-ordinate and improve the system.  There is a design to promote better compliance and understanding rather than relying on dispute mechanisms to such an extent.  I accept the point being made by the Deputy but I am not sure a dedicated section would make a difference.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	682	Is it not the case that the only reason these issues are even being discussed is that workers took action and forced a response from this Government.  I refer specifically to the cases of Vita Cortex, La Senza and Lagan Brick.  The issue raised by those struggles is what the Government will do to prevent a recurrence of this.  Workers want the Minister to ensure that workers who are owed money by companies will have first call in the administration process, and companies will not be able to shelter moneys owed to workers under other company names when those firms still trade in the State.  Administrators like KPMG should have a strict code of conduct applied on how to treat workers in these cases.There is a specific case where employees did not engage in an occupation but the Minister is aware of it and has done nothing.  Workers for the Jane Norman chain received exactly the same outrageous treatment when they had contracts terminated in June 2011.  They were not paid for a month and have still not received wages.  The firm went into administration and the workers were still not paid the money owed.  Some three or four months later, the Jane Norman chain, under the new ownership of Edinburgh Woollen Mills, again set up Jane Norman to trade in the State.  The workers have still not been paid.  Will the Minister intervene in this case, of which I believe he is aware, to ensure those workers are paid the month's wages they are owed, and that the situation cannot arise where a company sacks its workers, owes them money and redundancy, which still has not been paid, and then sets up again a few months later paying workers less and employing them on lower conditions?  What is the Minister going to do about that?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	683	The point must be made that the State is standing by workers in these situations.  For example, where cases have been pursued under the Redundancy Acts, it is the State that pays workers and ensures they get their rights.  The State would then have to pursue the employer, as is required under the law, to recover the money from the employer in those cases.  It is not the case that the State is not standing by workers; it is seeking to protect workers in this situation.

The State uses the machinery to protect both itself and workers in these cases.  I understand that in the case of Jane Norman, the administration that occurred there has recognised insolvency status under Irish legislation.  The money due to the workers will-----

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	687	-----fall to be paid from the insolvency payments scheme.  The State will honour the position of those workers.  A number of cases are still to be heard by the rights commissioner service in respect of employees from the company.The truth is that the State seeks to support both sides in resolving disputes.  Where they fail and there is genuine insolvency, the State obviously honours the commitment to workers.  In cases where dispute resolution fails and the situation is not genuine, the State pursues the employer to recover costs.  Where there is failure to give 30 days notice, the State can pursue charges against the company concerned.  Legally enforceable powers will be pursued in cases where they are appropriate.

All I want to know is whether that is a commitment from the Minister that the Jane Norman workers will be paid the moneys owed to them and that the Minister is going to investigate the matter and ensure those workers receive the same justice that workers in La Senza and others are attempting to receive?  Can I get a commitment that the Minister will investigate the Jane Norman case?

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I compliment the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the Minister on taking the initiative in the Vita Cortex case.  However, it has not succeeded.  It appears that a deal was done but at the 11th hour one of the parties reneged and walked away.  The situation is that 32 people were denied their entitlements by the owner of a company who has engaged with NAMA.  I appreciate that the Minister has engaged with the LRC on the matter, but what can we do for these workers who are being denied their rights and entitlements?  This group of people have been engaged in a sit-in for in excess of 40 days.  These workers are not prohibiting other work being done.  They are engaging in a democratic action to receive their entitlements.  They are not militants.  They are not part of any group of mavericks.  They are genuine, decent people who have in some cases worked for 47 years in the company.  Where can they go now?
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	742	The Minister has avoided many of these issues which have not been sorted.  Some La Senza workers are not being paid social welfare for the days of the sit-in.  Tens of thousands of workers are waiting for statutory redundancy payments.  Some cases came in under the radar before Christmas.  The Minister has made a lot of points about the industrial relations machinery of the State, such as the LRC, but what will he do given that there is a waiting list of 74 weeks for rights commissioner cases?  That is nearly a year and a half.  We have 15 rights commissioners and 44 staff in the LRC.  That is a reduction on the previous staff number yet, as the Minister acknowledged, the demands are greater.  He is not resourcing the machinery on which he seeks to rely.  What will he do about that?  Why is he continuing to use agencies such as KPMG for statutory or Government work given that it has been involved in bad practice?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	743	Some of those issues are way beyond my responsibilities.  My understanding in the case Deputy Boyd Barrett raised is that a UK administration was appointed.  The workers were not given their proper right of notice in that case.  It does appear to be an insolvency and under law the power of the Minister in such a case is-----
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	744	The company is trading again in the country.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	745	I will investigate whether that is the case and if that is undermining the position.  My understanding is that the insolvency fund will be called into action to honour commitments to employees.  I will take note of what the Deputy said.  He said that the company that went into administration is still trading.  I will investigate that.Deputy Buttimer asked what the next move is in respect of Vita Cortex.  An application has been made under the terms of the Redundancy Acts to the Department of Social Protection.  In the normal course of events it will pay out money to the workers when it has assessed the claim and seek to recover moneys from the employer.  There is also a question of redundancy sums being pursued which are beyond statutory redundancy.  That is not covered by the Department of Social Protection.  The LRC is maintaining contact with both sides to see whether there is scope to intervene.  That is the difficulty.  Through the LRC we will keep a close eye on matters and consider whether there is anything we can do to intervene.On the question of social welfare and KPMG being involved in other cases, it does appear that KPMG and Mandate had discussions that resulted in a fruitful outcome in that case.  Like the Deputy, I was surprised at the initial response that appeared to be forthcoming, but the administrator seems to have mended its hand and that issue has been resolved.  I can understand the impatience of Deputies.  Our system relies on co-operation from both sides, particularly employers, in honouring their responsibilities and is meant to maintain a voluntary approach.  It has served us well for many years and across many disputes.  We have established expertise that is clearly being put under strain by these disputes, but we will keep a watching brief and seek to make it work to the advantage of workers who are exposed in this way.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	746	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 18 together.In 2011, IDA client companies created more than 13,000 new jobs, up 20% on the previous year's level of 10,897, increasing the total number of those employed directly in companies supported by the agency to almost 146,000, representing a net increase of more than 6,000.  The IDA has informed me that there are 12 IDA Ireland-supported client companies in County Wexford employing 2,060 people.  Some 51 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland-supported client companies in Wexford in 2011.  The most significant announcement last year came in September when the Taoiseach joined Mr. Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, to celebrate the opening of the new $300 million Coca-Cola manufacturing and innovation facility in Wexford, which will facilitate the creation of 100 new jobs in the coming years.  This investment is a vote of confidence in Wexford by a global leader.The past year has been a difficult one for the south east region with significant job losses.  The rise in unemployment in the region has been sharper than in the rest of the country.  In the wake of the TalkTalk closure, I instructed my agencies to put together an action plan for the south east.  The report was published in December 2011 and contains many actions that can help deliver on the ambition of having a stronger local enterprise base, but it can only achieve so much.  There are challenges for all agencies in the region to help build up its competitive advantage and promote it in a co-ordinated manner.The south east received a boost earlier this month with the announcement that Eishtec, a Waterford-based company providing consumer contact centre services, is to create 250 new jobs by mid-2012 as part of a major new expansion at its new custom built facility in Cleaboy Business Park.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The situation in the south east is bad, but it is even worse in County Wexford.  The creation of 51 jobs out of 14,000 means that, compared with the national average, matters have worsened in the past year.  Almost 20,000 people are on the live register in Wexford and it is one of the country's worst unemployment spots.Two factors help people to get out of difficult circumstances, those being, jobs and education.  We are lagging behind dramatically in both respects.  This has led to significant social problems.  We have some of the highest illiteracy, teenage pregnancy and suicide rates.  We have no third level college.  The recent cuts in special needs assistants, SNAs, have had a dramatic effect in Wexford, probably more so than in most counties.  Cuts to resource teaching for Travellers and to language support teaching have had considerable effects on primary schools.  Gorey community school, the largest school in the country, has lost three guidance teachers.The situation is going downhill.  What active decisions can the Government take to reverse this trend?  Traditionally, places with poor land were poor.  The land in Wexford is good, but 50% more Wexford people were working outside the county than in it in 2007.  For some strange reason, few jobs have gone to Wexford in the past 20 years.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	748	I accept the Deputy's comments.  For the reasons he has outlined, I have directed the IDA to give a particular priority to the region.  It has suffered badly, and not only during the recession.  During the good years, the growth in its industrial base did not match the growth in other parts of the country.  I have also directed Enterprise Ireland to contact its portfolio of companies intensively and to make a competitive call for feasibility funding for new start-ups targeted specifically at the south east.  Some of Enterprise Ireland's new programmes will be piloted in the south east to give the region the first opportunity.  We have sought to build on the research excellences found in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and work with companies to develop them.  We are intensively considering what our agencies can do to promote employment growth in the south-east and to support business start-ups.Many of the issues the Deputy raised fall outside my remit.  I am acutely aware that, for a long time, the region has sought to upgrade from an institute of technology.  I understand that criteria will shortly be published to clarify the requirements for the development of a technological university.  The Minister for Education and Skills is clear on there being an opportunity for educational institutions to develop.  I acknowledge the Deputy's remarks and it is a region to which we are giving intensive attention.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The Minister should keep in mind that most of the initiatives to which he has referred are directed towards Waterford.  Wexford has a much faster growing population.  It is one of the country's fastest growing populations.  Many of the issues I raised are of a social nature and outside the Minister's remit, but the lack of jobs feeds into them.  For example, Gorey community school is the largest school in the country.  When I visited it last week, people were worried that students would fall through the net because of the cut to guidance teachers.The lack of jobs is creating social problems, yet we are cutting the measures to deal with those problems.  Given that Wexford has a fast growing population and has already fallen behind, its circumstances will worsen without active intervention on the part of the Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	750	This is active intervention.  I have already directed the IDA to ensure that 50% of projects should be outside Dublin and Cork.  Within that directive, we are placing a spotlight on the south east.  While that also includes Waterford, one must consider a region's strengths and its hub and gateway locations and try to build on what exists.  The IDA does not have the power to move jobs around and companies can choose locations.  We must consider the region as a whole.  I hope our intervention will help the entire region and not just focus on its largest city.  We will monitor progress.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	751	There are significant regional disparities in the State-aid provided through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  For example, County Meath has 4% of Ireland's population but receives 0.3% of IDA funding.  In three of the past five years, counties Cavan and Monaghan received no IDA funding.  Last year, Meath received two IDA visits in total.My issue relates to Deputy Wallace's questions.  When one approaches these enterprise organisations, one is often told that they find it difficult to get businesses to come to Ireland and that getting them to locate in particular regions is next to impossible.  How much is the Government spending on regional offices for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland if, by their own admission, they are irrelevant in terms of directing businesses to the regions?  We are funding a regional infrastructure within the State agencies, yet they cannot intervene to direct where the businesses go.Some businesses are operating without making provisions for contingent liabilities such as redundancy pay.  Therefore, they are operating in a bankrupt fashion.  Either the legislation or the policing of this matter is not working.  Will the Minister consider a system whereby businesses must pay a bond, as construction companies did in the past, to ensure those liabilities are covered in the event of company failure?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	752	Immediate success can be had by IDA Ireland in respect of smaller companies.  However, in the case of substantial job announcements, where the company in question is seeking a very deep labour pool, there is, of necessity, a certain restriction in terms of the regions that can offer a good fit.  More recently IDA Ireland's focus has been less on the blue chip companies and more on emerging businesses which are more regionally footloose.  It has had success in establishing such projects in regions outside of the core population centres.  That approach is working well.It is essential that we have a regional network whereby the agencies can work closely with local authorities and the other players which provide the property solutions and so on.  They must be able to work with educational institutions on research and development, for instance, and on identifying the needs of particular companies.  It is essential, whether for importing indigenous companies or IDA Ireland companies, that there be a support network which facilitates that level of intelligence.The Deputy is correct that there has been a growing focus within IDA Ireland on winning business overseas rather than concentrating on particular regions.  Traditionally, advance factories were the big selling point for the agencies, but that is no longer what companies are seeking.  Requirements are changing and IDA Ireland is evolving to meet them.Question No. 8 answered with Question No. 6.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	753	Good progress has been made by my Department and its agencies in reducing administrative burdens on business, with a reduction of more than 23% already achieved.  This amounts to annual savings for business of more than €198 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department's website.Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include company law savings of almost €80 million per annum, more than €33 million of which is due to the work of the Companies Registration Office, CRO, with companies now able to submit their annual returns online via the CRO website.  It is envisaged that by mid-year, the audit exemption threshold for companies with fewer than 50 employees will be further increased from the current limits - €7.3 million for turnover and €3.65 million for balance sheet - to the maximum allowable under EU law, that is, €8.8 million for turnover and €4.4 million for balance sheet.  Raising the threshold will increase the €4 million in savings already achieved.  In health and safety law, a total of €117 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the Health and Safety Authority via two key projects, namely, the BeSMART online tool for preparing the risk assessment and safety statement, at a cost of €53 million, and the SMP20 guidelines, costing €64 million, which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.The reorganisation of the five existing employment rights and industrial relations, ERIR, bodies, which I have set in train, will result in a simplified two-tier structure comprising a single body of first instance adjudication and a single body of appeal.  This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens.  Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for use in all existing bodies, the establishment of a single point of entry for all claims, and the creation of a centralised website containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations.  My officials are currently using the standard cost model to estimate the likely savings for business that will be delivered by the ERIR simplification and will report on these later in the year.  Estimates of the administrative burden savings that will arise from some of the simplified approaches within the consolidated companies Bill will be also produced.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.My Department also co-ordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target to be reached by the end of this year.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011, and I expect results from the first cluster of Departments by the end of the first quarter of this year.Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced.  In this respect, the high level group on business regulation is an important forum for my Department to hear directly from business representatives.  As part of the action plan for jobs, the Government will be undertaking an assessment of the opportunities to achieve further reductions in regulatory burdens.

According to the briefing I obtained from his Department, an initial target of a 25% reduction in administrative burdens was set, with that reduction expected to produce cost savings for businesses of €500 million.  However, the Minister of State says there has been a reduction of 23% and an associated saving of €198 million.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	755	The target is 25%.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	756	Yes, the target is 25%.  However, according to page 46 of the briefing given to me by the Department 12 months ago, a 25% reduction should represent a monetary saving of €500 million.  If that is so, how can a 23% reduction amount to a saving of only €198 million?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	757	The figure is a whole-of-Government estimate.  A large number of intergovernmental bodies and Departments are working on this initiative, but my reply referred only to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is about the simplification of regulations, but not all of the Departments that are bringing in reductions deal with business.There are many simplifications that can be introduced to make the methodology and operation of a Department more effective.  The burden of inspections on companies and the associated regulatory requirements are very much a hidden cost.  We are obliged to reduce that cost.  In regard to the simplification process, overall administrative burdens in the areas of company law, employment law and health and safety law have been reduced by more than 23% to date.  Details of all of these initiatives are available on the website.In addition, workshops were held around the country, which were very well attended, in which we discussed how best we can engage with business people.  The high level group established by the previous Administration has as its aim to identify burden issues to Government and to follow through on the implementation of corrective measures.  As a former Minister, the Deputy will be aware that it is difficult to bring that mind set into Government.  The high level group has been effective thus far, with progress being made in regard to the health and safety statement, online taxation returns and so on.  It is about finding practical solutions.  In regard to enforcement and inspection, there is now increased co-operation with those bodies.  Our objective is to reduce inspections of compliant firms and to identify those which are not compliant.Written Answers follow Adjournment.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	759	There is serious concern regarding the awarding of the contract for rail maintenance to a British company, Balfour Beatty, which has also been awarded the €400 million contract for maintenance of the Bord Gáis grid.  The reason for this concern, other than the fact that jobs will be lost among Irish contractors, is the company's poor safety record.Most of this record relates to incidents on the British railway system, including the derailing of a train on a section of line laid by the company.  In 2006 Balfour Beatty was fined GB £7.5 million after a train crash which cost four lives and caused 100 injuries on a section of line maintained by the company.  In 2007 it was fined GB £180,000 following the fatal electrocution of one of its line maintenance workers.  The company also has a rather colourful history in terms of securing contracts.  In 2008, for example, it was fined GB £2.25 million when the Serious Fraud Office found it guilty of false accounting.  In 2009 it was fined GB £5.2 million by the Office of Fair Trading for corrupt practices in securing construction contracts.In the light of all this, can the Minister or the public be satisfied that the railway system will be in safe hands?  Surely the company's record ought to have been taken into consideration before these contracts were awarded?  There is also the worrying development that all of the major contracts for such work within State companies are apparently being awarded to overseas companies.  In this instance, the company in question has secured lucrative contracts with Bord Gáis and larnród Éireann, while the contract for line maintenance within the ESB is also being tendered abroad.  How does this sit with the Government's target of creating indigenous employment?  Irish companies and Irish workers will be considerably impacted by the loss of this work, despite having delivered such contracts to a consistently high standard over the years.  That record stands in contrast to the standards of the company in question.Will the Minister confirm the belief among Irish companies that there is an obligation on public bodies to seek tenders from within the EU?  Given the state of the economy and the need to generate employment, there surely ought to be an obligation, particularly on the part of State companies, to ensure such contracts go to Irish companies, which have an established track record in this type of work.  I am seriously concerned about awarding this contract to Balfour Beatty given its track record and appearances and convictions before the courts.  From a security point of view, given its convictions for fraud and malpractice, this is a dangerous precedent for any Government to set.

I thank Deputy Ferris for raising this issue.  I was not aware until now of the information which the Deputy has just put into the public domain.  Perhaps he will provide me with a copy of it.As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, does not have an operational role in larnród Éireann nor does he make decisions on awarding of contracts by the company.  This is a matter for larnród Éireann and its parent, CIE, in accordance with their procurement policies.  The Minister understands from larnród Éireann that on 20 February 2010 a procurement process was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union seeking expressions of interest from economic operators in a procurement competition intended to lead to the award of a contract to operate and maintain the On Track Machines, OTM, fleet.  A procurement evaluation panel, which consisted of suitably qualified and experienced larnród Éireann infrastructure managers, determined which was the most economically advantageous tender having regard to the award criteria.  On the basis of the decision of the procurement evaluation panel, approval from the board of larnród Éireann and the board of CIE was sought to conclude negotiations and to award a contract to the preferred bidder, in accordance with CIE Group procurement policies and procedures.  The decision was approved by the board of larnród Éireann on 25 October 2011 and by the CIE board on 3 November 2011.The participants in the tender process were advised on 9 November 2011 of the decision reached in regard to the award of contract, in accordance with the requirements of SI 131/2010 European Communities (Award of Contracts by Utility Undertakings) (Review Procedures) Regulations 2010.  Under the Railway Safety Act 2005 and EU Directives, the Railway Safety Commission, RSC, is responsible for the regulation of railway safety in Ireland and ensures compliance with EU obligations.  In accordance with provisions of the Act, the primary duty of care for the safety of the railways rests with the railway undertaking and its management and staff.  On works on the railway, larnród Éireann ensures that all such operations comply with overall safety requirements and standards.The Minister has been informed by the Railway Safety Commission that the activities of any OTM operator-maintainer, including movements over the larnród Éireann network between depot and work site, are subject to safety certification by it based on assessment and acceptance of a safety management system that fully complies with EU regulations.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	761	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I will forward the information I have to his office.  I previously raised this matter in the House with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, when I was sure all of this information was available.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, stated that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has no operational role in awarding contracts.  In light of the information I brought to the House last week and again today, will the Government revisit contracts that have been awarded in terms of safety, including the colourful history of the company that secured this contract?The company concerned was fined £7.5 million following a train crash on a section of line it had maintained, resulting in the loss of four lives and 100 injuries.  It was also fined £2.2 million by the Serious Fraud Office and £5.2 million by the Office of Fair Trading for corrupt practices in securing construction contracts.  This is worrying.  I understand these convictions are on public record.  I will forward the information to the Minister of State's office.  I hope it will be looked at and that the Government will revisit the terms of contracts and will investigate whether this information was disclosed by the company concerned.Many Irish companies with good track records in terms of safety and so on are unable to procure employment.  Given the current economic climate here, with so many people unemployed and more people regularly joining the dole queues, there is an obligation on the Government and everyone else here to ensure that, where possible, there is positive discrimination of Irish companies.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	762	During my time as Opposition spokesperson on transport, CIE and Iarnród Éireann were regularly invited to committees to discuss issues like this.  Following receipt of the information from Deputy Ferris, I will ensure it is given to the Minister and will ask that it be forwarded to the board of CIE.  The key point is that the Minister for Transports, Tourism and Sport has no role in deciding where contacts are awarded.  That is the function of the boards of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.  The Deputy has rightly raised the question of whether they were aware of the facts outlined and if so, what implications, if any, this might have in terms of the legal awarding of the contract to the successful bidder.Six expressions of interest were obtained from the initial advertisement.  Following a pre-qualification process, four entities were invited to submit tenders.  Three tender submissions were received.  larnród Éireann determined that it wished to award a single contract encompassing operation and maintenance services.  As one of the tender submissions related to maintenance services only, this tender was not considered for the purposes of awarding the contract.  Following initial tender submissions in September 2010, the tender evaluation process entailed four rounds of discussions with the two companies competing for operation and maintenance of the contract.  Negotiations in this regard concluded in September 2011.The contract award criteria for the purposes of the tender evaluation comprised 65% cost, 30% methodology for provision of services under the contract and 5% start-up time.  A procurement evaluation panel, which consisted of suitably qualified and experienced larnród Éireann infrastructure managers, determined which tender submitted the most economically advantageous tender having regard to the award criteria.The issues the Deputy brought to my attention will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the company concerned.  I suggest to the Deputy that, as the Minister has no role in awarding contracts, he, as a member of the transport committee should, as a matter of urgency, ensure Iarnród Éireann is called to attend before that committee to urgently discuss these issues, at which point he can seek all information to which he is entitled.The Railway Safety Commission is the regulator in this area.  I have no doubt it will ensure that any activity carried out for and on behalf of Iarnród Éireann will meet all safety requirements.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	763	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome this opportunity to discuss what I believe will be a critically important issue for the Government and country over the coming months, namely, fracking.  This practise is causing fear and concern for citizens who live in areas identified as having potential for extraction of shale gas, one of which is in the Clare area and the other of which is in the Leitrim area.  I will concentrate on the area with which I am familiar, which is the Clare area.This practice is causing grave fear and concern for many people living in the Clare area.  They have heard the stories from other countries of the devastation of fracking on communities, community life, groundwater and tourism potential.  People in Clare - and, I am sure, throughout the country - have strong views on this issue.  So strong are they that the local council has during the past two weeks commenced the process of ultimate banning of fracking in Clare and other areas.Obviously, the democratic process has worked well at local level and it is incumbent on Members, within the confines of the Dáil, to act on the advice they have been given by local authorities such as Clare County Council.  I call on the Minister of State to take on board the views and comments of those concerned, that is, the local elected representatives and those whom they seek to represent, to ensure no further licences, exploratory or otherwise, are issued; that no commercial activity is allowed to begin and that the Government moves at the earliest possible opportunity to implement a nationwide ban on the process of fracking.While Members are the custodians of the land, in the great scheme of things they are only here for a relatively short time.  It is vitally important that we not do anything to the nation and its lands that would render it completely redundant for future generations.  They have a responsibility to protect the environment.  The research I have undertaken indicates that the process of fracking would have a detrimental impact and effect on the areas concerned.  West County Clare which is known as a beauty spot has a certain population density.  It is of vital importance to protect the livelihoods of those who wish to reside in such an area.  Were Members to turn it into a wasteland by allowing the process of fracking to be developed, they would be telling future generations they would be obliged to move away from the area.  Ireland is a small island with a fair-sized population.  It cannot afford to turn vast tracts of the countryside into wastelands.The Government should move quickly in this regard, rather than giving the exploration companies which come here, albeit in an exploratory capacity initially, a potentially legitimate expectation.  However, as the giving of a licence marks the first phase, the very fact that it is issued creates an expectation.  Moreover, it is not good enough to state such companies must have an EPA licence or will be obliged to secure planning permission.  Ireland should take a firm decision immediately that it is not in favour of onshore fracking.  There is potential to find natural resources offshore in our seas, which is positive and on which we must follow through.  However, a line should be drawn under onshore exploration through fracking at the earliest possible opportunity in order to prevent it from becoming an ongoing issue.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue in the Dáil and the Ceann Comhairle for selecting it.  I agree with the Deputy that it is an important issue.My Department has not received applications for or licensed the use of onshore hydraulic fracturing in Ireland.  The earliest an application could be made is early 2013 and the earliest exploration drilling could be considered is 2014.  The question for Ireland is not whether it should be declared a fracking free zone.  Instead, we must be clear in our understanding of the potential implications of this technology before any project proposing its use can be authorised.There is potential for Ireland to enjoy both economic and energy security benefits from its indigenous oil and gas resources.  However, such benefits will only be realised through effective exploration.  Ireland has a policy of actively encouraging investment by relevant companies in oil and gas exploration, both onshore and offshore.  All such utilities are subject to a robust regulatory framework with the clear objective of ensuring such activities are carried out in a safe manner and without causing harm to the environment.The holders of the three onshore licensing options granted last year by the former Minister of State, Conor Lenihan, have a first right, under the authorisations given by the previous Government, to apply for exploration licences in the same areas.  The granting of the licensing options has commenced a process which I stress was commenced by the previous Government.  In the event that it leads to applications coming before me, any such applications will be subjected to rigorous and detailed assessment.  Strong regulatory processes are in place, involving An Bord Pleanála, the EPA, my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation and others, that would apply to future projects.  All these bodies, other than An Bord Pleanála, would have an involvement at both the exploration and production phases.  All these processes are subject to a range of national and European Union legislation, including the environmental impact directives, and include a public consultation phase to ensure concerns of the community are heard.I acknowledge that people have, as is right and proper, concerns that the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration and production activities could have a negative impact on the environment.  Plenty of examples may be found if one considers the film "Gasland", reads the press, examines the finding of the American Environmental Protection Agency, considers what happened in France and so on.  This is an important subject and the Government is concerned that if hydraulic fracturing does take place, it must only do so in the most stringent and acceptable of circumstances.  The principal concerns expressed relate to the production phase of a project.  The production phase in commercial production entails the use of chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic.  Moreover, I refer to other serious issues such as the impact on the water table, the possibility that methane gas might flow from one's tap and so on.  Regardless of whether they relate to hydraulic fracturing or loose practice, these are the issues, each of which must and will be considered in this context.Members of the House are aware that the debate on fracking is taking place worldwide.  In a number of European countries exploration for unconventional gas is ahead of Ireland.  Countries such as France have introduced a ban, while Poland actively encourages this form of exploration.  In the United States there has been extensive exploration, as well as strong debate and considerable controversy.  Members are aware that the Internet is rich with articles on the subject, many of which express contradictory views.  However, a US EPA preliminary report found that compounds associated with chemicals used in the United States during the drilling of wells that had been hydraulically fractured were also found in groundwater at locations near an exploration project.  The findings in this preliminary report have been challenged by the exploration company and the final outcome has yet to be decided.The key lesson to be taken is that decisions can only be made on the basis of the best expert scientific advice available.  This is the reason the EPA which is conducting preliminary background research will undertake more extensive research on the matter later this year.  This research will help to inform the Government's decision.  Any further applications will be the subject of a number of robust consent processes and any decision I make as Minister of State will be informed by detailed scientific assessments.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	765	While I welcome the Minister of State's appearance in the Chamber to discuss this issue, I am disappointed he has stated it is not about declaring Ireland to be a fracking free zone, as it is.  Carbon fuels are a finite resource and at some point the supply in the ground will be exhausted.  The sooner this is accepted the better and the sooner this becomes obvious to exploration companies, the sooner alternatives will be suggested.  It is not permissible to destroy the environment and the Earth to the point of no return only to then accept all the fuel is gone and we have to find an alternative.  This will happen until such time as governments state enough is enough, which would force investment in alternative energy sources.  If the government of a small island such as Ireland which, because of its greenness and tourism potential, is synonymous with respect for the environment is not prepared to do this, we have much to learn.The Minister of State is the kind of campaigning Minister who could take the bull by the horns and turn it around.  He could stand out across the world, were he prepared to take this decision.  I implore him not to be driven by certain individuals within his Department who have a view that this would be good for the country from a commercial perspective.  The argument is that as Ireland is going through difficult economic circumstances, it should try to exploit and explore the potential to be found in the environment in this regard.  Even were we to destroy the environment, we would ultimately reach a point at which no more mineral resources were available.  We must, therefore, be bold and brave and take a long-term view.  I ask the Minister of State to give further consideration to this issue which I acknowledge is one that will require a whole of government approach and thought process.  He certainly should not rule out the principle of making Ireland a fracking free zone.

I did not interrupt the Deputy and it is important to have complete clarity on the issue.  The process has started and the companies in question will return by the end of the year with a view as to what they think they have found, after which they will proceed to the next stage when I will have to give due consideration to all the arguments made.  When that stage is reached, I will be advised by the EPA.  The latter is already carrying out a desktop study and is committed to carrying out a much more detailed analysis by the end of the year.  The analysis in question was not carried out prior to the licences being issued by the former Minister of State, Conor Lenihan.  The difficulty is that we cannot turn back the clock in respect of this issue.  I assure the Deputy that any decisions I make will be based on the best advice available from the EPA and internationally.If there is a chance that billions of euro in untapped gas could be brought to the surface and thereby provide a massive boost to the economy, then we must take account of that fact.  If it became possible to create thousands of jobs in my constituency or that of the Deputy and in view of the fact that we import most of our energy, then that prospect would be worthy of serious consideration.  I accept the point the Deputy made in respect of renewables and I will be happy to debate the matter further with him at any stage.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	769	I welcome the Minister.  I am glad to have the opportunity to reiterate the sentiments I expressed and observations I made at the relevant committee in 2010.  This debate provides an opportunity to appraise the position with regard to the level of mobile phone coverage available in Ireland and also to consider what has happened since 2010.In the period 2008 to 2010, there was a 30% increase in the number of text messages sent.  Between March 2010 and March 2011, 5.6 billion texts were sent by Vodafone customers alone.  The breakdown of the relevant statistics shows that of the various mobile phone operators, 3 has a market share of 5.8%, Meteor's share is 20%, Vodafone's is 42% and O2's is 32%.  There is a need to analyse why there has been such an exponential growth, approximately 10.8%, in the number of texts sent.  We could state that things may be good and that from a business point of view, this could be seen as a positive development.  However, we must also examine the position with regard to various areas in which there is basically no mobile phone coverage.  This is leading to large numbers of dropped calls.In 2010, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, used a very specific methodology to measure mobile phone coverage.  This was population-based and was focused on the cities.  In carrying out its analysis, ComReg engaged in test drives along national primary and secondary routes.  Obviously, this did not take account of coverage on smaller roads and, as a result, we can question the methodology, particularly as the results which it produced have given Vodafone, O2, Meteor and 3 the opportunity to state that they provide 99% coverage.  Under the criteria set down by ComReg, this is probably correct but it is certainly not the case in reality.It is important to point out that we are not seeking the provision of additional masts, rather we are seeking an increase in "piggybacking".  Many companies are already working together on this.  They are also working in partnership with different State agencies.  For example, RTE is renting space on its masts to various phone companies.  However, there is still a need to discover whether coverage has increased.My mobile phone bills have not been dramatically reduced.  I have spoken to others whose bills have not been reduced either.  In addition, there are still high numbers of dropped calls.  There is a technical issue with regard to 3G coverage, which relates to videos, e-mails and large documents.  In the context of this matter, I refer specifically to 2G coverage.  When I leave my home in Carrigart to drive to Dublin each Tuesday, it is a nightmare when I try to have conversations with people on my phone.  I travel through Northern Ireland on my way south and even though the Orange and Vodafone UK networks operate there, the coverage is still disastrous.There are people in the Gallery from Lifford, County Donegal, and I am aware that they have difficulties with dropped calls and that their phones drop into and out of UK coverage.  In that context, there is a need for a debate on the entire cross-Border dimension to this matter.  When the Ceann Comhairle attends meetings of the North-South Parliamentary Forum hosted in Northern Ireland by the Speaker of the Assembly, William Hay, MLA, he incurs costs if he receives e-mails on his laptop or iPad.  We must, therefore, consider this matter in the context of the North-South integration commitments contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  We must also consider why we are incurring additional costs and the role played by ComReg.Let us consider the good co-operation in which the United Kingdom and Ireland engaged in recent years, even prior to Queen Elizabeth ll's visit last May.  There is no doubt that a great deal of business is being done.  In that context, some 47% of our exports go to the United Kingdom.  If we want to turn intangibles such as the positive goodwill between our two countries into something tangible, we should consider ways in which we can make it easier for people to communicate while doing business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to place on the record of the House some remarks in respect of this matter.  I am also glad to take the opportunity to outline some of the initiatives undertaken to improve the quality of telecommunications infrastructure in regional and rural areas.As Deputy McHugh will be aware, the electronic communications market in this country is fully liberalised and is regulated by the independent regulator, namely, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The provision and quality of electronic communications services, including broadband, is a matter for those private sector service providers which are regulated and licensed by ComReg.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms, including DSL - that is, via telephone lines - fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  As Minister, I have no role in the operational matters of these private companies.The role of the State in the provision of broadband infrastructure is generally limited to policy and regulation.  In terms of direct service provision, the State can only intervene in areas where the commercial service providers have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In this regard, the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband into these areas.  In the case of one such intervention, namely, the national broadband scheme,  broadband services are available from 3 in all of the 1,028 electoral divisions designated to be covered under the scheme.  This includes 200 of the 514 electoral divisions located within the Border area, namely, those in counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo.  This represents just under 40% of the total number of electoral divisions in the region.  As regards the remaining electoral divisions there, the national broadband scheme was prohibited from providing a service in these areas which were deemed to be already served and where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.While broadband and mobile phone coverage is now available across the entire country, I am aware that there continue to be a relatively small number of premises that are not capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons such as suitability of telephone lines, distance from an enabled exchange and no line of sight.  The Government's most recent intervention, namely, the rural broadband scheme, which is currently in the verification phase with licensed service providers, is aimed at making broadband services available to individual unserved premises in rural non-national broadband scheme areas.  This could include individual premises located in the non-national broadband scheme electoral divisions in Border counties.  A total of 1,148 applications to the rural broadband schemes were received from those counties.  Each application corresponds to an individual household or premises.The advances in the provision of private sector broadband, along with the interventions of Government I have outlined, means that Ireland will reach the European Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having basic broadband available to everybody well in advance of the 2013 deadline.  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high-speed broadband is, as Deputy McHugh has argued, a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services available across Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll-out of high-speed services.I would like to conclude by mentioning the next generation broadband task force, which I chair.  The task force is considering how best to facilitate the roll out of next generation broadband throughout Ireland, which reflects a commitment under the NewERA proposals in the programme for Government.  The task force will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of its report and to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband, and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the programme for Government.I thank the Deputy for raising this topic and am glad to have had the opportunity to respond.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I appreciate the Minister's clarification and I appreciate the work in which he is involved.  There are rural areas with no masts and where the dongle can be used on a laptop as well.  That has all been acknowledged.  The Minister is correct to say that these are private sector players and that he does not have a direct role in what they invest, but we have a role through ComReg.  Consumers need the utmost protection in terms of the money they invest when signing up to a service provider, and in the service that they receive.  Many will argue that they are not getting service in certain areas, such as in parts of Donegal, Monaghan and Kildare.We have to examine whether ComReg's objectives to analyse mobile phone coverage through the methodology of the population base is good enough.  We can be open about this conversation and it is good to have an ongoing analysis.  It is important to see if the Department of Justice and Equality is open minded to use Garda station masts as piggy backs for mobile phone services, rather than have new masts built.  I know that RTE masts have been used by different service providers.Can the Minister analyse the methodology used by ComReg to measure the broadband coverage?  The advertising literature of Vodafone and O2 claim that they have 99% coverage.  That is the case according to their rules, but in reality they do not.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	772	I accept Deputy McHugh's point that a methodology that relies solely on population does leave rural areas in some difficulty.  The way things have developed in recent times means that there is fierce competition between the private sector companies for the urban consumer, but some of the same companies are not very interested in the less populous areas to which Deputy McHugh makes reference.  That is a concern.I was looking at the electoral divisions for the counties, which is the subject of the motion.  There is only 35%-58% coverage of the national broadband scheme in those areas.  That leaves a gap.  The purpose of the next generation task force is to devise a road map for the future that will identify where there is normal competition between the private sector operators and the rest, and figure out what the Government can do about the rest.  There is a basic service everywhere nowadays, but I accept that it can be too basic in some areas and that there is a genuine problem with speed and quality that must be addressed.I hear Deputy McHugh's essential point, which is that there is a necessity to re-examine the driving methodology of the regulator, which is population based.  I certainly will take that on board.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	773	Following on from the last debate, this issue is about service provision that is essential for our citizens in rural areas.  We must never underestimate the value of the post office to deliver economic and social services to citizens residing in rural Ireland.  Not only do they have access to postal services, but also to essential services such as banking, the television licence payment system and social protection payments.There are areas I would like the Minister to examine to ensure the future viability of our post offices, such as the payment through our post office network of motor tax and the new household charge.  I know the Minister is looking at new household broadcasting charges.  Access to those services should be available to rural citizens as well as urban citizens on an equal basis.As a semi-State company, An Post has a commercial mandate from the Government, but I believe it should also have a social obligation to meet its customers' needs.  Many post offices have already closed in rural Ireland, and the impact has been felt severely in those areas.  An Post may justify these closures due to the proximity of the closing post office to other available post offices in the jurisdiction.  However, the time has come where we need full transparency around these decisions.  We need clarity on the criteria used by An Post to close such post offices.Kill is a rural village in the heartland of mid County Waterford, and the post office there services a full 10 km radius, and includes villages such as Bunmahon, Dunhill, Annestown and Ballylaneen.  None of those villages has a post office and the people in the area all use Kill post office.This post office was burgled in October 2011 and there were problems.  I believe An Post took an opportunistic decision to close the post office.  I took the matter up with the CEO and the senior officials in An Post, and I was very disappointed with the response.  It took two months for an elected representative to get a response from the chief executive of a semi-State company.  Not only that, the information on the letter was incorrect.  It stated that the nearest post office available to the remaining customers is four miles away, when in fact it is 10 km.  It is just not good enough for an area with no rural transport links to be abandoned and left in isolation.  This issue needs to be revisited and a social impact assessment carried out prior to any decisions being taken by An Post.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	774	I want to take this opportunity to speak about the basis on which An Post currently justifies the closure of rural post offices, namely, on economic grounds and non-viability.  This does not take into account the commercial services that accompany such post offices, such as those outlined by Deputy Coffey like banking services, social welfare distribution and often private shops, which are a vital part of the rural infrastructure of local communities.  Post offices are often the focal point for people and give business and life to the local shop, which is a central part of any rural society.  I would also like to point out that post offices provide a social support to individual members of the public, mostly those who are elderly and at risk of further isolation.I understand that An Post is a semi-State company and has a commercial mandate, but the Government also has a stake in Bus Éireann and the ESB.  Bus Éireann provides, perhaps not to the extent that we would like, a service that is non-profitable to areas of low population.  The ESB provides electrification at a commercial loss to the islands.  The Minister should look at how An Post can also provide a service to these rural communities.  Deputy Coffey has outlined the difficulty faced by many people in mid County Waterford with the closure of Kill post office.  I bring to the Minister's attention some statistics of which I have become aware in recent weeks.  The week prior to the robbery and the subsequent closure of the post office almost 700 transactions took place there.  This shows a great opportunity to grow its viability.  As Deputy Coffey mentioned, we can also look at the introduction of other services such as motor tax and foreign exchange.  We could look outside the box.  Rural County Waterford is a very scenic and beautiful place and we could have tourist information points for those we want to visit the county.  We should consider the example of the ESB which operates at a loss by providing electricity to the islands and rural parts of the country.  Will the Minister take on board these points?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	775	The Government's core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure Irish customers, whether business or residential, enjoy competitively priced, high-quality postal services.  The Government is committed to a strong and viable An Post and supports its maintenance of the maximum number of economically viable post offices.The Government also appreciates the importance of the rural post office infrastructure.  The programme for Government recognises that the universal postal service is an essential public service, especially in the case of rural communities and those disadvantaged communities affected by the digital divide.  The importance of the postal business and the post office network was recognised by Deputies during the comprehensive debate on the Postal Services Act last year.Deputies are aware that the commercial operation of An Post's post office network is a matter for the board and management of the company and not one in which I have a direct statutory function.  An Post's original mandate stems from the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 under which it was established.  The company is required to provide counter services for its own and Government business and other uses which the company sees fit.  This counter business has developed significantly over the years and now encompasses a range of financial and bill payment products which are offered alongside the more traditional features such as NTMA products, social welfare payments and stamp and television licence sales.An Post is facing challenges in its postal and mail business from the revolution in communication technologies.  An Post must build on its intrinsic advantages such as the scale of the post office network, brand name and strong connection between postmasters and their local community to re-invent itself as a dynamic and sustainable business in the technological age.  I am confident the management and staff are capable of doing this.An Post management has succeeded in growing business at post office counters generally.  Most Deputies are familiar with some public concern at queues and delays in certain post offices.  This is not the sign of a failing business.  Equally, Deputies should be aware of the success of new services such as foreign exchange in certain outlets.  The counter business is not immune from the threat presented by the development of electronic alternatives to traditional counter business.  An Post management cannot wish this away, nor will I ask it to.At the last An Post AGM, it was made clear to the board that new value-added services must be found to maximise the potential of the post office network.  The recession and banking crisis have increased the amount of business being conducted through post offices.  An Post must take advantage of this and has been encouraged to give further consideration to identify scope for post offices to generate additional business, particularly on the banking agency side.As a result of large-scale investment in the computerisation of the network, the company has had success in securing business growth in its contractual arrangements with AIB, Western Union gift vouchers, Garda fines and BillPay.  In addition, An Post wins a significant amount of business from Departments for postal services and financial services delivered through the post office network.  Approximately 62% of post office network business comes from Government work.  However, while the Government will continue to strongly support An Post, a reliance on Government contracts in the future is not a valid or robust strategy for An Post to take to address the challenges it faces.The Department of Finance is looking at strategies for the further development of e-inclusion initiatives in the financial services area.  An Post already has a strong track record in dealing with people who are financially excluded and An Post will have a central role in the development and implementation of initiatives along with the other stakeholders in the area.  The Department is working to ensure the advantages offered by An Post are fully recognised in the design of products and services to address financial exclusion.The importance of An Post to rural communities is well recognised and as a company it must seize all opportunities to remain relevant to its local customer base.  I understand the concern of the Deputies about the financial viability of the post office counters service.  I will continue to facilitate business expansion by the post office counter business because it is only this growth which can provide a sustainable basis for the survival of an expensive post office counter service in rural Ireland.  I will pay particular attention in the months ahead, with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Protection, to the development of a universal basic bank account product which I want to be accessible in the post office network nationwide.The Government recognises the strategic importance the postal sector plays and the central role An Post has played to date.

He has identified many challenges facing An Post and I agree it needs to reinvent how it delivers services to those in rural Ireland.  However, it certainly cannot provide these services if it closes post offices without tangible assessment of what extra delivery could give rural areas.  Will the Minister take an active interest in this area on behalf of rural citizens?  I do not expect a post office at every crossroads; far from it.  However, I gave the example of there being no post office in a 10 km radial in mid-County Waterford.The Minister used the phrase "financial exclusion" and this is what is happening to many customers of the Department of Social Protection who used the post office in Kill.  They are financially excluded because there is no rural transport link or ready access to alternative postal services which are more than 10 km away.  This is unacceptable and An Post needs to review this.  The Government must be cognisant of the changes in rural Ireland to ensure that we protect services as far as possible.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	777	The CEO of An Post acknowledged that the post office network is vital to businesses and the social fabric of Irish society.  The social dimension of An Post's services is under-estimated, misunderstood and misrepresented by An Post.  If the CEO truly believed what he stated Kill post office would not have been closed.  He showed disregard for the residents of the area by not even having the correct information, stating that the nearest post office was only four miles away when it is more than 10 km away with a round trip of more than 20 km.  For people already struggling to collect pensions this is a considerable imposition.  There are no rural transport links or Bus Éireann services to facilitate access to An Post services.  Decisions on the closure of post offices cannot be made on economic imperatives alone.  The social impact of something like this cannot be measured on a balance sheet.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I accept what Deputies Coffey and Conway have stated on the social role and responsibility of An Post.  We spent a good deal of time during the debate on the Bill discussing this very issue.  The difficulty is that An Post is also a commercial State company and it must be viable; this is its mandate.  It is this balance between the commercial mandate and the social responsibility that is sometimes difficult to get right.I agree with Deputy Paudie Coffey that there is a need for the company to continue to reinvent itself.  We should make no mistake: electronic substitution has caused the gravest of problems for An Post and there has been a dramatic decline in its revenue in recent years.  There has been a drop in volume of more than 20%, which has caused very serious difficulties for An Post.As regards the fact that Kill post office is closed, until Deputy Conway brought the matter to my attention yesterday, I was not aware of it.  I do not know the circumstances surrounding the robbery that seems to have precipitated its closure, but I will undertake to raise the matter with the chairman of the company.  I do not know whether it is the intention to reopen it.  I accept it is not the most strategic approach to the retail infrastructure of An Post that, for whatever happenstance, that if a post office is closed, it will remain closed because it is one less.  I will examine the prospects in the case of Kill post office in that context.

As I said earlier, the report of the Environmental Protection Agency as well as others indicate that the levels of pollutants from septic tanks are, to use their word, minor and that the cost of remedial works is approximately 5% of the overall cost in dealing with.  I am disappointed, however, that the Minister is not prepared to specify the standards that will apply.  This is unacceptable.  It is reasonable to expect standards to be specified in legislation such as this, as Members and the public should know the exact position.The Minister asked those of us on this side of the House how we would solve the problem.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	788	The Minister stated earlier that financial hardship would not be imposed on anyone who needed to have his or her septic tank adjusted in any way.  Can I take it that people will not have to pay for adjustments where it is not their fault?  If there are costs involved in remedying a tank to meet the new regulations, the Minister has stated no one will suffer financial hardship.  I take it there will be grants.  Is that true?  The Minister is not answering my question.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	789	I am guided by the Ceann Comhairle who is the boss.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	790	The Minister will probably agree with me that it would be very unfair if people had to pay for something for which they were not responsible.  I agree with the Government that this is a problem which must be addressed but under no circumstances should the cost fall on those who are not responsible for the fact that their septic tank does not measure up to the new regulations to be applied.The Minister has said he will take a risk based approach rather than have all septic tanks inspected.  I am curious to know how he will decide on which tanks should be tested.  Wexford has the second highest number in the country and I am fairly confident that close to 50% will be found to be disappointing, as there is a huge problem with percolation in the county.  There was also a huge problem with the raised beds scheme because the soil used was not good enough to take the bacteria out of the wastewater before reaching the water table.  That presented a major problem.  Many were allowed to use soak pits in the earlier days which are now clogging up and do not work as a result.  There is also the issue of the outfall to running streams, which is now illegal.  Obviously, permission was obtained to do this, but it will cost money to change it and since no one will suffer financial hardship, I presume the Government has plenty of money set aside.  Obviously, the Europeans have agreed to give some money because it will cost a good deal of money to rectify the problem.  In fairness, it will create some unemployment, but I hope ordinary people will not have to pay for it.

The Minister gave an undertaking on Committee Stage that he would publish the standards and that they would be brought before the Oireachtas.  Is he confirming that this will happen before he signs the commencement order?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	792	I said that before the Deputy arrived.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I understand the reason the Deputy was not here.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The second point is that we accept it is risk based, but when examining the risk involved, we should look at the areas in which there are high levels of groundwater pollution in considering the framework plans, but my understanding is that the Minister will be looking at the type of system in place.  I have no doubt the grid will take into account the type of system in place and that on any risk based analysis those with older systems will be at much higher risk of not complying with the standards and are, therefore, certain to face inspection.The third aspect the Minister appears to gloss over at times is that regardless of whether one's septic tank is inspected, one is still required under the Bill to bring one's system up to the prescribed standard, even though we do not yet know what that will be.  If the Minister could deal with these issues, we would be able to move forward.If the Minister is right that approximately 10% of septic tanks will fail and that the average cost will be approximately €2,000, the cost of providing a 100% grant will be €100 million.  That will be a small sum out of the €1.5 billion he has set aside for water and wastewater services in the next five years.  If he really believes what he has been saying to everybody for the past four or five months and since he believes this will be so cheap, he should be able to announce today that there will be a 100% grant to meet the cost of prescribed upgrades.  If we could get this, many problems will be solved and the only issue that will remain will be the provision of a 100% grant to meet maintenance costs.

He has stated that what he is proposing will not impose financial hardship on any family, but at the same time, as Deputy Éamon Ó Cuiv pointed out, he is not willing to come forward and say what he is proposing.  He did not clarify the exact standard to which he hopes septic tanks will be raised.  He has not clarified that if he is asking a person who was granted planning permission in the 1980s to move from the standard of regulations with which they complied at that time to a higher standard of regulation which is to apply to the septic tank now, exactly what standard that is to be.  In his response to these further queries, could he clarify the position?Many people were outside these Houses earlier today seeking clarification, and it a was a shame the Minister did not go out and address them.

We can face the people with our heads held high on our track record of work any day of the week.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I am sure Deputy Healy-Rae told people the full information about what we were discussing here today and told them the fact that I have said on many occasions that no planning will be required and that all we want to know is the year the septic tank was provided on a particular dwelling, irrespective of whether it was in the 1940s, 1970s or 1980s.  We want to know whether the septic tank is doing the job it was intended to do and whether it is working.  The regulations I will lay down will show that to be the case in due course.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The Deputy and his Government were doing something about it.  Proposals were brought as far as Cabinet.  I read them earlier for the benefit of other Deputies but I will give Deputy Ó Cuív a flavour of what was involved here.  The Deputy and his Government said at the time that, arising from a consultation in October-November 2010, where his Government had committed to file a defence with the European Court of Justice arising from that judgment or else fines would have been imposed, the new system would set out the duties and responsibilities of householders regarding their on-site waste water treatment systems and would require householders to have their on-site systems assessed to ensure those systems were being operated and maintained correctly.  Second, it would specify the frequency at which these assessments would be carried out.  Third, it would require householders to take any remedial action necessary to bring their on-site waste water treatment systems up to required standards and the timelines within which such works were to be undertaken.  When it came to the standards, the Deputy said that they must comply with the EPA code of practice for waste water treatment and disposal systems serving single houses dated October 2009.

The Deputy was prepared to bring in stringent standards for inspection and monitoring of septic tanks and he never told us about it and neither did he tell the people at all the public meetings he attended about all the various standards he was prepared to bring in.  I am not prepared to bring in those standards.

He should tell the people of Connemara and those attending public meetings the implications of his policy arising from what he intended to do in 2010.

We had debated the issue of the State financing this and if the State were to finance it, surely it was good to have it to the highest standard.

If that is so, why is the 2009 standard proposed by the EPA?  It is inescapable logic and that is the point the Minister has been missing from beginning.  What he is trying to say to the people is that he will get away with a low standard, he will wait for An Taisce to go over to Brussels and for Brussels to give him an order in regard to 2009, and then he will throw up his hands in horror and say that he cannot fund all of that and that people will have to pay for it themselves.  That is exactly where he is leading the people.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	854	Having listened to the debate, it comes down to the issue of standards, which is the subject of the amendment tabled by Sinn Féin, which we are supposed to be discussing.  My concern relates to site size.  I heard what the Minister said and the assurances that were given, but this is not contained in the legislation.  In relation to the site size, the issues include the size of the septic tanks, the location of the septic tanks, the quality of the percolation area, the location on the site of the septic tank, the maintenance of the septic tank and the frequency of the desludging and emptying of the tank.  They are the issues with which the inspectors will deal.  The Minister is being flaky on this and his predecessor, Mr. Gormley, was accused of being flaky.  The Minister's answers have been very non-specific.  This measure will be eased in and the EPA inspectors will not be flaky but will be very specific on this.I wish to return to the issue of grants.  I agree with the Minister on the risk-based approach.  I hope he is talking about using the mapping system close to water sources and that it is not risk-based as in risk of each tank.  I hope that is what he is talking about and, if it is, it is good news.  That said and in the context of whether there to be an army of EPA licensed inspectors carrying out inspections, we must have grants in place, and the Minister has said he will examine that in 2013.  He said the other day that he might yet consider a scheme of grants to be brought in, or he was quoted as having said that in an article in The Irish Times.  That is the furthest I have heard the Minister go in that respect.  The Minister has to give an upfront commitment in the House today to implement a scheme of grants.  I outlined to the Minister a case-----

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	860	-----two people in their seventies who will need grant aid to upgrade their septic tank.  If the Minister sends out an army of inspectors who force those unfortunate people to meet very high and stringent standards which they will not be able to be meet, I appeal to him to give an upfront commitment that he will try to help those families, particularly those who cannot afford it.  Let us work together to improve ground water and water quality.  We want to do that.  I am sincere in saying that.

In page 4, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following:"(3) The prescribed date shall not be sooner than the making of regulations in relation to maintenance, servicing and operation of domestic waste water systems.".When we discussed the issue of standards in the context of amendment No. 1, the Minister said a standard much lower than that provided for in the water framework directive or by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 would suffice in this case.  I would not like to doubt the Minister.

The Minister has given an undertaking that the regulations will not be made until they have been published, subjected to public consultation and brought to the Dáil and Seanad for discussion.  We are trying to ensure the horse really does go before the cart.  We will need to know the full facts of the regulations and to have them debated.

I ask the Minister to accept this amendment, which seeks to ensure that before this legislation is commenced and registration begins, we will know the standards that will apply in cases of maintenance and upgrading.  We want to ensure we will have had an opportunity to see whether the standards to be proposed by the Minister will stand up to a challenge.  If the standards are so easy and so different from those set out in the 2009 code of practice of the EPA, as the Minister keeps saying they are, they should withstand our scrutiny.  Before we can agree to anything, we will have to ensure the standards cannot be overruled in a court case in Brussels.  As a Deputy quite rightly pointed out, Irish Governments have introduced many laws in the belief that they were firewalled against challenge from Brussels.  The original laws in this case can be included in that list.  Unfortunately, when non-governmental organisations have gone to Brussels, we have often found that what we thought was firewalled is firewalled no longer.  We cannot take a chance on this issue.  Is the Minister willing to accept amendment No. 2 so that we can get the guarantee we need, so that the prescribed date for making the commencement order of registration, shall not happen sooner than the making of the regulations in relation to maintenance, servicing and operation of the domestic water systems, so that we stop buying a pig in a poke, as the Minister has been trying to do for the past four or five months since he proposed this Bill?

If the Minister's documentation is correct - I am sure his officials would not supply him with incorrect information - I acknowledge that previous Governments intended to push ahead with the 2009 standards which would be very onerous on rural dwellers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	898	Absolutely.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	900	This has been sitting around for the past 37 years and as a new Member, I fail to see how this has gone on for 37 years, how the people who were here before us and some who are still here, did not find time to sit down and work out how to sort out this problem, to achieve a consensus and to deal with it.I refer to the commencement date for the application of the standards.  I refer to people with small sites such as quarter-acre or half-acre sites and where percolation areas have been added outside of the site boundaries, with the permission of adjoining landowners.  I ask that in these cases, the Minister will guarantee that people will not be forced to buy land to comply with whatever regulations are introduced.  I know this is a difficult issue and there will need to be give and take with regard to it.  Many people on small sites in areas with poor percolation have been forced to locate a percolation area beyond the boundary of their own site.  I ask the Minister to address this because it is of great concern to people.  They are worried that they may have to buy land from an adjoining landowner and in many cases they are on low incomes and do not have the wherewithal to purchase land.The Minister is in the driving seat now.  The previous Government did not do anything about increasing the grants for group sewerage schemes.  The grant for group sewerage schemes is only €2,000 while the grant for the water schemes is €6,000, even though a far smaller pipe is involved.  I wrote to the previous Government when I was a member of the county council but no action was taken to increase the grant for sewerage schemes beyond the level of the grant for water schemes.  I ask the Minister to look at this issue because many of these problems could perhaps be solved by small group sewerage schemes on the outskirts of towns which would bring many of these ribbon development houses on the edges of settlement areas into the main sewerage system.  The Minister knows what I mean because he was a county councillor.  I ask for some commitment from the Minister to examine that issue which is very important and which will help to improve ground water around many of the towns and to encourage people away from septic tanks if they are living on the fringes of main settlement areas.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	901	I support amendment No. 2.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the commencement date is not imposed before the regulations are published and agreed and discussed in the House, as stated by Deputy Ó Cuív.One of the strange aspects of the debate on the Water Services (Amendment) Bill has been the lack of any real clarity as to the regulations.  The Minister has been a little misleading as he had stated previously in the Chamber that people would only have to comply with the regulations in force at the time a house was built.  This means that anything built in 1970 would only have to comply with the 1970 regulations.  To my mind this creates an administrative nightmare in the regulation of septic tanks as neighbouring houses could be judged on completely different standards.  It is generally believed that the regulations will more than likely be very close to the 2009 standards when finally adopted by the EPA.  This will place very onerous conditions on people and cause difficulties in compliance, as outlined by Deputy Stanley.  The size of site required to comply with the 2009 standards is 0.6 of an acre whereas most people's houses would only be on half an acre.  This would leave them in great difficulty in compliance.  The regulations must take into account the smaller sites and people would not have the room to construct new percolation areas to meet those very onerous standards.  A certain number of houses have been built in the recent past which comply with the 2009 standards and yet a lower standard may be chosen by the Minister.  It is very difficult to debate this issue when we do not know what the standard will be.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment to ensure the standards are in place and have been debated in the House before the commencement of the legislation so that even at this late stage, we will be given some certainty as to the necessary compliance.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	902	As this is my first time to speak on this Bill I wish to briefly set out the context.  I will not delay as I am conscious that there are many amendments to be considered.  It should not be necessary for anybody to have to say that it is in all our interests to have clean water throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Every person in this House would agree, as would the good people from Connemara who left home at 6 a.m. this morning to travel to the gates of Leinster House; they all want clean water.  Everybody outside this House wants clean water.  The only reason I say this is that some of the contributions from some speakers on the Government side of the House seem to imply that because amendments are put forward we do not want clean water or we are prepared to live with risky water.  That is not the case.Because of the number of amendments, a statistician would be drawn to the conclusion that it is probably faulty legislation in the first place.  People in rural areas are now to be penalised because of the failure of the previous Government - and it was a failure - to introduce a waste water inspection and management system and the decision of the present Government to go ahead with this proposed legislation to fill that gap.  This action is not based on any clinical or measurable findings as to levels of pollution; it is based on the fact that the EU Court of Justice found there was a failure on the part of the Irish Government to provide a waste water management system.  Legislation already exists to deal with those who cause pollution of our waterways.  However, instead of introducing a pollution monitoring and management system, it now appears the Government is setting out to push through legislation when the impact of this legislation cannot be known.  There is nothing specific about this legislation; it is only specific with regard to commencement dates.  This is very dangerous were the Bill to be passed in its present form.This morning, the Minister asked for trust.  He asked us to trust him and to allow the legislation to go through and everything would be all right.  The Minister will understand that some people will have great difficulty in trusting something in a Government which appears to be more concerned about bailing out reckless financial gamblers than it is about protecting the interests of Irish people.  I would identify the gaps that have to be filled before this legislation can proceed.   Those gaps include the required standard of the septic tanks, and we have already had a vote on that.  There is nothing specific in that.  Will the standard of the septic tanks be uniform or will it vary according to the level of risk presenting?  For example, there is the proximity to water courses or prevailing soil types.We were delighted to have the Minister in Leitrim quite recently but it is a pity the visit was at night.  If he had come during the day he would have seen the beautiful glens, hills, mountains, lakes and rivers, although we have "challenging" soil types in Leitrim and parts of Sligo.  At this time we do not know if the standards that the Minister will devise will apply across the country or according to prevailing soil types.  We need to know exactly what financial support will be provided to people who find that their systems do not comply with the new standards, whatever they will be.  What will happen if a person is ordered to upgrade a septic tank and treatment system but the upgrade requires additional ground which is not available?  What will happen if the adjoining soil - even if it is owned by the person in question - is inadequate?  It may have been adequate when the septic tank was installed but it may be inadequate now.It is very wrong that this legislation will criminalise people who stuck by the rules and did what they were told.  Standards have changed so these people will be outside the law.  Until such gaps are filled and we can be assured that there will be equality of treatment for those who live in rural areas and those who live in urban areas, the Minister should not expect trust from the people.  This legislation should not proceed.

I support Deputy Collins's amendment.  I will not go over what was asked of the Minister by all the previous speakers but we cannot buy a pig in a poke.  We cannot say "everything will be all right, Jack" and if we sign up to this, the Minister will look after us.  Does he intend to have a slush fund so he can look after some people?  He could make a phone call to a county manager and let certain people off because they are his colour.  That his what it seems like.

The Minister was elected on a basis of trust, which is being quickly eroded.  He must build the trust of the people but he is undermining whatever he has, so the people do not trust him.  He is coming here and being flippant, arrogant, less than fair and dishonest.  He is telling us that we are scaremongering and that it is Deputies Ó Cuív and Mattie McGrath who want the 2009 standards implemented.  That is nothing short of poppycock.  Everybody in this House knows the latest standards will be applied at all times, or else what is the point of having standards?  There were no standards in 1963 so is everything fine once it works?  Jim will fix it, or perhaps Deputy Tom Hayes.Mistrust is the basis of the issue.  We cannot be expected to vote when we have seen no standards or ideas about regulations.  The Minister can tell us that certain standards will be used but I know An Taisce and other bodies would not be worth their salt if they did not go to Brussels or take more court cases against the Irish Government.  I do not want them to do so.  The Minister has made a big deal about this court case, that there will be big fines by the beginning of February and that European courts will have their effects felt again.There cannot be one law for Tipperary and another for Kilkenny, although I am sure the better one is for Kilkenny.  Two weeks ago the Minister promised €1 million to Kilkenny County Council to set up offices almost in Waterford city while at the same time cutting out Tipperary.  The Minister is playing a political game in trying to be a cute, smart and be the big man.  He is getting nowhere.

I am asking the Minister to indicate what standards will be used before he allows any inspections.  He is talking about a consultation after the Bill is passed.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	910	I support amendment No. 2, proposed by Fianna Fáil's Deputies Niall Collins and Ó Cuív.  Since the debate started this morning, it has become evident that the trick of the loop from the Minister is in getting people to register.  Once there is a register and a database, the Minister can wash his hands of the process at a later stage by arguing that the EU is to enforce the latest standards.  The implications of adhering to the latest standards have already been outlined by other Deputies.  There are many houses around the countryside, for example, built on sites of less than half an acre, and cottages built long ago may have been built on a quarter acre.  What will the people in such properties do if they must install the most modern percolation areas, which take up a vast amounts of ground, if they do not have it?  The financial and social implications could be enormous.Somebody may suggest that I am exaggerating.  It would be great if the Minister could listen.  Would anybody have believed that the EU would tell us that our stocking density and the retention period for sheep and cattle on farms must double, as it has done recently?  It is trick of the loop again.  Stock levels were fine in 2011 but they would have to be doubled, along with retention, to qualify for the single farm payment.  I allude to this to show that once the register exists - including names, addresses and the locations of septic tanks - the people will be at the mercy of some EU body issuing a directive to the Government.  It could stipulate that all the registered households must adhere to the latest standards.  What would be the financial implications and why is the Minister not telling the people the truth and that they could be exposed to such a practice?The Minister has made accusations of scaremongering against respectable politicians like Deputies Ó Cuív, Niall Collins, Mattie McGrath and Ferris, who have highlighted this issue and let the people know the truth.  I also accuse them of something.  I accuse them of giving information where the Minister did not and I accuse them of telling the truth when the Minister was holding back on letting the people know the truth.  One of the most offensive elements of the process is the way this has been rushed through.  At 1.30 p.m. tomorrow the vote will be held and the debate will be guillotined, all because the Government has a majority and can rush this through without proper debate.I will address another matter.  In earlier contributions, Deputies who support the Government gave the impression that people speaking out against this Bill really do not care about the countryside.  Some people would like to give the impression that people from the country do not care about it.  I met very respectable and nice people from Galway and Connemara today.  They left their houses this morning at 5 a.m. and got on a bus when there were plenty of other things they could have done.  I am grateful to them for coming.  They came because they do not want a financial burden on their families but these people, living in the countryside, cherish the fact that they live there.  Anybody with land does not just own it, they adore it.  Anybody who does not own land does not appreciate or understand what I am saying.  The people who own land and farm it do not see it in the same way as somebody who owns a glass; although they own the land they are only holding it for future generations.  They want to pass it on to sons and daughters in pristine condition.  That is the case with anybody who owns land.  All they ever wanted to do was improve it and now they are being told that they cannot do that either, that they will have to apply for planning permission to open a drain or to knock a ditch.  That is why people are angry and that is why politicians on the Opposition side of the House are excited and energised.  We are trying to stand up for people.  The Minister was inclined to snigger at the contributions of Opposition Members but he should remember that when he does that he is sniggering at the people outside of this House.  They are people whom we respect and whom we are in the House to represent.  I took offence at the suggestion that people did not care about the countryside.  We want clean water as well as anyone else.  Why, at a time when local authorities are guilty of polluting our waterways are we going after people with septic tanks and letting local authorities off scot free even though they have inadequate systems in place for towns and villages?  They are the ones polluting the waterways not the people with septic tanks.  I support amendment No. 2.  Because of the Minister's contributions, not only is he the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but he is also the Minister for total confusion, because that is what he is creating.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	911	As someone who lives in an urban area the Minister is probably surprised to see me speak on the Bill.  I got figures the other day which indicated that approximately 19,500 people in Dublin have septic tanks.  In my local authority area the figure is 5,000.  The constituency I represent, Dublin South-West, covers rural areas such as Bohernabreena and Brittas.  It contains the Blessington Lakes catchment area which is used for the provision of water for the Dublin area.  A stringent approach is taken to planning applications in that regard.  It is natural that people are concerned about what may be coming down the line.  They are seeking clarity.  It is difficult for people to understand how they have to pay the tax but in some cases, literally 100 yards down the road, people are linked up to the main sewer.  Deputies referred to standards.  That is the double standard that people cannot understand.  No effort or support has been forthcoming from the local authority or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to try to bring those people into either the water or sewerage schemes.  It would be helpful if the Minister could signal that supports would be forthcoming or that an action plan would be put in place for those who are caught in such a situation.Tallaght is a new city yet people in the middle of Tallaght have a septic tank.  I raised the matter with the local authority but I have been told there is no funding available or planning in that regard.  I accept that the Minister has the required majority to implement the legislation but if the work is not done today as part of the overall package it must be done in the future.  We must connect people with septic tanks to the mains system.  Many of the people to whom I refer are elderly.  They are getting on in years or they do not have the financial wherewithal to do the work.   We all want to see a top class, clean water system but we should not penalise people who are in this situation.  Many of the families concerned have lived in the area for hundreds of years.  They would like not to be reliant on wells, chemical toilets or septic tanks.  They want to be connected to the mains system but there are no plans for that.  I accept that rural areas are a separate issue.  I sympathise with those affected but this is an aspect of the debate that has not been aired.  I would like the Minister to respond to it at some stage.

It does not do the debate justice when the Minister refers to the contents of previous documents.  All of us in the Opposition are trying to do the best we can for people in rural communities.

I grew up in a small cottage in a rural area where toilets and septic tanks were only introduced in the 1960s.  I can remember when there were no toilets.  Many of my neighbours' houses were built on perhaps one eighth of an acre or less.  In the 1960s they put in their own makeshift septic tanks.  From 1975 onwards the planning regulations were introduced specifying that the minimum size of a site must be a quarter of an acre.  That became half an acre and it is in excess of that currently.A number of houses were built on a laneway close to the village of Fenit.  It was an old village itself at one time.  A total of 15 or 20 small cottages were built on a site about the size of the Chamber.  The owners put in their own septic tanks at the time.  I tried to help them connect to the main sewer which passes their front door.  The Minister might remember that I raised the issue previously.  The cost per house for them to connect a pipe from their own septic tank to be connected by the county council to the public sewer was €10,120.  The people concerned are in their late 60s or early 70s and have lived there all their lives.  They cannot afford to do the work.  They will not be compliant with any of the standards introduced between 1975 and 2009.  They do not have the frontage or the space.  Inevitably, if they want to be legally compliant it will cost them €10,120 to join up with the public sewer.  That is one example from the small area where I live.  I am sure that similar situations will arise all over the country.The Minister commented on people having to be compliant with the new standards, whenever we see them.  I am concerned that no financial hardship would be imposed on people.  What does the Minister mean by "financial hardship"?  Is he saying that he will put a grant system in place to ensure that people will have access to funding to help them become compliant?  Will it be the case that, as happened in many areas in the past, it will depend on whom one knows to approach a Deputy, Minister or someone who could try to resolve the issue?  Will the system be means tested?  We need to know what the Minister is thinking.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	916	It is very unfair to us when we are trying to debate this in good faith with the Minister and he will not tell us what he means by "financial hardship".  It does not make sense.  I do not wish us to continue in this manner.  There was great hope when the Government was elected in February of last year.  People said that we needed a change.  They were sick of what went before.  The rhetoric in the lead-up to the election from Fine Gael and Labour suggested a new beginning.  We were led to expect transparency, honesty, openness and fairness and that the Government would stand by the ordinary people and look after those most in need.  Unfortunately, the record to date suggests otherwise.  I do not take solace in saying that, for the sake of attacking the Government.  I find it incomprehensible to say the least that we paid €1.25 billion today to a toxic bank yet we do not know what the term "financial hardship" means in respect of people who have come all the way from Connemara and other parts of the west to protest outside the Houses.  They could return home tonight knowing that, by being here today, they have been given answers to questions that have concerned them and many others across rural Ireland.Irrespective of whether the Minister knows it, people residing in rural Ireland feel discriminated against.  They have been neglected politically and have found themselves being caught for everything.  One cannot even go for a pint because it would put one off the road.  There are no public services left in most of rural Ireland.  Small post offices, Garda barracks and small shops are gone.

We want to get away from the Paddy the Plasterer politics that we endured in the House for a long time.  The Minister has an opportunity.  When he gets to his feet in five or ten minutes' time, he can tell us what he means by "no financial hardship".  He can allay many of the concerns of those who have come all the way from the west at their own expense.  If he does so, it would be a good day's work and I would be the first to agree that he was providing transparency.  If he does not do so, he is confirming the opinions of many people.We need certainty about whether a grant procedure will be made available to meet the cost of remedial works.  It would remove a major problem.  According to my colleague, Deputy Stanley, the Minister stated that compliance works or the updating of septic tanks would be exempt from the planning process.  If so, it is welcome, as it was a major concern.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	932	I welcome the Minister's public statement of it today, but I want him to state that there will be no cost to anyone who must undertake remedial work to upgrade his or her septic tank.  I reaffirm the absolute commitment of every Member who has spoken to good, uncontaminated water.  We will support whatever remedial works are necessary to bring that about, but it cannot be at a cost to these people.Anyone who has applied for planning permission since 1975 has needed to comply with regulations lest the application be refused.  People have done everything required of them legally.  The regulations and standards have changed significantly since 1975.  People were granted permission before 2009, yet that year's standards for septic tanks and percolation systems would render many of them non-compliant.  Many people are concerned about this issue and do not know what is coming down the tracks.I have attended meetings with Deputy Healy-Rae and he can vouch that they were information meetings intended to explain the legislation.  They were necessary to assure people.  We are arguing these points because we engaged with the public.  We spoke with people who would be the victims of what was coming down the tracks, given the possibility of remedial works to their septic tanks.  We are bringing our experience to the Minister, just as the people from Galway and Connemara are doing.We need to get to the bottom of the issue.  Central to this is the question of what is meant by "no financial hardship".  Who determines what it is?  The easiest, simplest and most honest approach would be for the Minister to put in place a grant procedure to cover all necessary remedial works.  On this and Committee Stage, the Minister stated that only a small number of septic tanks, as low as 10%, would need to be upgraded.  Compared with the moneys that taxpayers have contributed to upgrading treatment plants, 10% is a very small amount.  According to Deputy Mulherin, €3 million was spent on upgrading Galway's water treatment services following the outbreaks of recent years.  Apparently, a good job has been done.The main polluters are local authorities.  I know this personally.  I am certain the Minister will make available to local authorities whatever money is necessary to upgrade their treatment plants to the required standards, yet there is no mention on the record or in the legislation of what the Minister will make available to the ordinary citizen of rural Ireland."No financial hardship" is a throw-away remark that needs to be clarified.  When the Minister rises, I hope he will tell the House that it means the cost of remedial works will be grant-aided in full.  It would be necessary.  The Minister stated that the 2009 standards would not apply, but will the applicable standards be below the 2009 levels?  If so, will we be open to a concerned citizen or group taking a challenge to Europe, a year or two after which we will be back here facing the threat of more fines?

Will he also confirm that the standards to be applied will not be brought into question down the road?  He is the only person who can give us the answers to these questions and put the matter to bed.  It is nothing more than that to which we are entitled.

It strikes me that there could be nothing more democratic than what the Minister is proposing in this regard.  He has undertaken to put the draft standards in the public arena and consult extensively on them.  He has given a commitment that they will be approved only after that consultation process is completed and subject to approval by the Oireachtas.I appeal for a degree of honesty in this debate from Members opposite.  The Minister is faced with registering a defence in a court hearing which must be done, as I understand it, by early February.  The legislation does not include detailed standards, but there is a clear commitment to publish them in draft form, consult the public thereon, including those who have taken the trouble to travel here today and rural communities throughout the State.  All of this song and dance routine about the issue of standards does not stand up to scrutiny.  What we are seeing is political posturing.

Deputy Michael Colreavy observed that it was regrettable that the previous Administration had not dealt with the issue.  On the contrary, people in rural communities should breathe a sigh of relief that Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív and his colleagues in government did not deal with it.  Their proposal was to inspect every household, to charge €300 for so doing and to have a standards-based legislative approach to our obligation in this regard.  That is the document to which the Deputy and his colleagues in government were privy and it is the proposal for which Deputy Mattie McGrath voted.

We all have the same objective.  In my constituency two public water supply schemes have been on boil notice for far too long because of faecal contamination.

However, all he wants to do is to exploit the fears of people living in rural areas.  The people to whom I have spoken in rural areas are committed to their environment and water quality.  There is a way to achieve this, part of which requires the Government to respond to the court ruling which found against the State and exposes us to very considerable financial penalties.  This legislation constitutes a measured response.  It will not involve a charge of €300 per household, as the previous Government proposed.  It does not call for the inspection of every household, as the previous Government proposed.  It will not require compliance with the most recent SR6 regulations, as the previous Government proposed.

We will publish the standards, engage in consultation thereon and bring them back to this House for approval.  That is a reasonable and sensible approach to take.  It is a very good day for rural Ireland that the Deputy did not deal with this issue when he was in government.  If he had, rural householders would be facing a far more difficult situation.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	998	I have three queries for the Minister, two of which I have raised before and which he refused to answer.  First, when he says there will be no financial hardship for householders, does this mean grants will be available to assist them in bringing their septic tank up to the necessary standard?  I trust this was not a throwaway remark by him.  I am sure he would not speak loosely and that it is his intention to ensure there will be financial supports for home owners who, through no fault of their own, do not satisfy the new regulations.My second question relates to the risk-based approach the Government proposes to take.  If it is committed, as it should be, to providing clean water and having a healthy environment, how does it propose to assess which households should be tested?  Perhaps there is a hard and fast rule or it is more vague; I do not know.  If grants are made available for remediation measures, will the Government be tempted not to go too far in order to avoid costs, or is it serious about cleaning the water table?Does the Minister believe a sum of €2,000 on average will be enough to fix septic tanks in need of remedial work?  I have installed many septic tanks and would be surprised if such a sum was sufficient to remediate many of the septic tanks in County Wexford.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	999	Deputy Michael Creed made some interesting points about what we are trying to achieve.  The sensible thing to do for the people in dealing with this potential pollution source - one of many but a minor one - would be to prevent it from happening.  To do this, certain actions will require to be taken.  However, because of the manner in which the Government is going about it, this will not happen.As in most things when it comes to the European Union, we are doing this not because we give a damn about water quality but because the European Union will beat us with a big financial stick if we do not, which in itself is not a reason to do anything.  One should do something because it is right to do it, not because one will be fined or beaten with a stick for not doing so.  If the Government approached this issue from that point of view, it would have a greater chance of bringing people along with it.  As I understand it, we are doing this because if we do not, we will be fined.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1000	It is the rule of law.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1001	On standards, in telling us that whatever standard was acceptable previously will be okay, the Government has proved to me that this is not about water quality.  I do not agree with this.  We should have the highest standards possible.  In 2005 contractors came to Castlerea, following a decision relating to pollution of watercourses in the area.  They did not come to my house which is in an urban area to tell me that if I flushed my toilet and did not contribute to the €9.5 million sewage treatment scheme, I would be imprisoned.  Also, they did not try to get away with complying with 1975 standards.  Their task was to secure the water supply from potential pollution emanating from urban housing stock, in respect of which they put up the money and put in place the highest standards.  No one in the town protested against the scheme because it was being paid for from their taxes and they were happy to go along with it.  Just as the people outside the limits of the town do not want to pollute the water supply, those living in the town do not want to pollute it either.If the Government wants this legislation to work on a quarter of an acre, half an acre or a ten acre site and to have the highest standards, it should pay for them, in the same way as those living in urban Ireland paid for them.  My taxes went towards the cost of the sewage treatment scheme in my home town.

#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1003	The taxes of people living in Addergoole and Corrasluastia went towards meeting the cost of the urban scheme in my area and the same should happen in this case.  There is money available.  Regardless of how much money has been wasted, the Government still has €16 billion to spend on capital projects in the next four years.  If even half the number of septic tanks in the country need to be upgraded, even in the most extreme case, at a cost of €10,000, the Government should do it.  Regardless of the value it will achieve from the €16 billion it will spend on capital projects in the next four years, it will not obtain better value than it will from spending €1 billion, if that is what it takes, in this regard.  It would secure watercourses from potential pollution.  What an achievement that would be within a period of four years.  Even if it was to cost €1 billion, half of this sum would come back to the State by way of taxes, VAT and so on.  Also, there could be a saving by the removal from the dole queue of people who could be engaged in fitting these systems.  It would be a win-win.I have heard people in Connemara got out of bed at 5 a.m., 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. to protest here.  I do not know what time they got up, but I do know that the people of Connemara would have camped outside overnight if that is what it would take to make their case.  People would not have to protest if the Government took the sensible route.  People living in rural Ireland do not want to pollute their water supply.  They have to make up bottles for their babies with that water and to brush their teeth with it.  They do not want to be criminalised or accused of being bad citizens, as they have been time and again, including in the newspaper of record.  I am beginning to doubt if it deserves that title anymore.  We were torn into by its journalists as though we were gurriers or backward.  We want a clean water supply, but we also want to be treated equally.  I come from a townland in which many people live.  The Government paid for my sewage treatment scheme and should pay for the schemes of my brother and sister who live in the country.  If it does, no one will have a problem with what it is doing and the European Union would be happy, which is what is important.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1004	The debate has focused on standards and the prescribed date for publication of same.  The legislation proposes that inspections will be carried out by inspectors licensed by the EPA.  The Minister asked how we would solve this problem.  I suggested some months ago to him that under-employed local authority engineers and technicians could do this work.  Rather than go out with a stick with which to beat rural dwellers over the head, they could offer them advice and support in the of improvement of their systems.I have previously raised the important size of sites issue with the Minister.  His party, Fine Gael, represents large farmers.  He knows this, as does Deputy Tom Hayes and Deputy Michael Creed who has left the Chamber.  I will try not to be too political about this.

People living in small cottages, those who built small bungalows on half an acre or on small one quarter acre sites are the ones who will be caught out.  I am pleading with the Minister to guarantee before we leave this Chamber this evening that people will not be forced to buy extra land.  I have told him about areas in which the percolation occurs off-site.  The people concerned must be given assurances.  Like other rural Deputies, I need to be able to tell them that they will not have to buy extra land and that those on the edge of towns will be brought into group water schemes in towns.

Sinn Féin fully supports the upgrading and maintenance of septic tanks.  I also agree that groundwater and the environment should be protected.  However, I recognise that some will simply not be able to meet the costs involved.  A fund must, therefore, be established to assist householders who will be required to upgrade their systems.  Hundreds of millions of State funds were invested in urban wastewater systems.  The same support must now be given to rural householders required to improve their septic tanks.

This is part of a suite of taxes, comprising the household tax, the water tax, the septic tank tax and the property tax, all of which have been imposed on ordinary, middle and low-income earners and poor people in general.  Its purpose is to pay anonymous speculators and bondholders.  The money raised is to be handed over to the banks and those who destroyed the country and brought about the recession.  I note €1.25 billion was handed over today and that a further €1.2 billion will be handed over before the summer.  Moreover, we will pay €3.1 billion in promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank on 31 March.  This is what the septic tank and other taxes are all about.  They are about making ordinary people pay for a recession they had no hand, act or part in creating.

Members are unable to find out from the Minister what the standards will be.  He makes vague comments about agreements with the European Union, NGOs and so on.  Since the beginning of this month I have submitted freedom of information requests to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government seeking details of all discussions the Minister and his departmental officials have had with the European Commission, NGOs and the EPA.  I have done this because it would provide me with the information Members cannot glean from the Minister and which would tell them what was actually happening.  If the Minister was so anxious for Members to be so informed, he would have instructed his officials immediately to ring my office to indicate it would pass the information to me quickly.

However, his time is up for now.  I ask him to conclude as I must call Deputy Mattie McGrath.

I must compliment Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan on his contribution in this regard.  As a townie myself, I have made the point to the Minister that when one lives in a town, the facilities are upgraded without a means test.  Moreover, the waste is taken away and maintenance conducted without a means test.  When there is equality between urban and rural dwellers, the standards become irrelevant because, as the Deputy observed, the higher the standard, the better for everyone and the cleaner the water.The Minister has stated I have exploited people at public meetings.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1061	However, he is whispering continually.  I once used to like a band called Big Tom and the Mainliners.  However, this is like Big Tom, Big Phil and the Chancers because they are not addressing the Bill.  They are trying poppycock and giving Members gobbledygook.  Moreover, a public meeting is to be held in Dundrum, County Tipperary, which has been organised by Deputy Tom Hayes and which the Minister will attend.  However, it is no longer public, as I cannot attend.  In addition to being an elected Member of the House, I am also a member of the public in south Tipperary, yet I cannot attend the meeting.  Why will the Minister not face me or attend a public event in a place in which he would have to answer the questions asked of him?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1062	The Deputy should hold his own meeting.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1063	Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív is dead right.  When this legislation is enacted, all householders will be obliged to meet the standards laid down.  Moreover, as Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan noted, all householders want to meet these standards.  All Members seek is for the Minister to put his money where his mouth is, by giving grant-aid to all householders to upgrade to the highest standards possible.  Moreover, for the Minister to try to suggest the EPA regulations of 2009 will not be applicable, or possibly even the EPA regulations of 2012 at this stage, is a complete fallacy.  In the real world, be it agriculture or industry, the latest standards must apply, as why have standards otherwise?  The Minister  has suggested standards dating from 1957 or 1948 or whenever one wishes.  While such suggestions might have washed at one time, they will not do so any more.  The Minister and Deputy Tom Hayes know this better than do I.Fine Gael represents the people who live up the long boreen or rather the long avenues with daffodils on the side.  Although they are coming out early this year, they will wilt with the cold weather and the snow, just as Fine Gael will wilt before the next general election.  This is because the people have only had to put up with it for ten or 11 months but already hate it with such a ferocity that they are waiting for it.  It will not be getting many more votes from the cottiers or any place else from which they might have swung in and out last year in the big cars.  It will not happen anymore because the people will not be caught again.

It should not be a public meeting mar dhea, for Fine Gael supporters in Dundrum, County Tipperary.

At one meeting I attended Councillor Toiréasa Ferris, a highly articulate young lady, spent at least 30 minutes giving clear information to the best of her ability in so far as she had such information.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1069	Deputy Martin Ferris should note that Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is looking for preferences in the new five-seat constituency.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1070	Unfortunately, the full facts and information are not available and that is how the Minister has made a mess of it.I wish to highlight another issue and hope someone outside the House is  taking note of this debate.  Members are dealing with important issues and very important probing questions are being asked by Members on this side of the House.  In a short time the division bells will ring and it will be like blue flies coming through the door.  Members will rush in to vote against the Opposition at every opportunity, albeit not to listen to it.  However, where are these blue flies now?  Why are they not present in the Chamber to engage and participate in the debate and either support the amendment and try to justify what they are doing or give their reasons for opposing it?  Why are they not present to engage in this very important debate?  I particularly wish to address my comments to rural Deputies.  Regardless of whether he or she supports the Government, any rural Deputy worth his or her salt should be present in the Chamber to debate this legislation.  I warn those from rural areas who are going to offer the Government their blind support that they will be obliged to inform their constituents why they will be obliged to comply with the legislation at a time when the local authorities are the most major polluters.Sinn Féin and other groups have been targeted and accused of misinformation.  They have provided the best information available to them.  Unfortunately, however, the Government fell short in this regard because it did not provide us with the correct information during this entire process.  It is a bit rich for the Minister to refer to what he stated on Committee Stage.  He only provided Members with the relevant information at that point.  Why did he not supply such information months ago?
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1071	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I do not agree with the Minister that all the opposition to the legislation is coming from this side of the House.  I attended a public meeting last night and noticed that many of his party's activists were present.  Those individuals were quite concerned about the legislation, as it stood.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1073	Surely there should have been no need to send 20 or 30 of them to the meeting to spy on proceedings when a single individual would have sufficed.  Why does the Minister not propose to publish the regulations to which the legislation will give rise?  Why does the Bill state, "The Minister may, following consultation with the Agency, make regulations for the purposes of this Part"?  Is the Minister honestly suggesting the EPA is not going to advise him to opt for its standards?  Is he stating the EPA is going to suggest a less stringent set of standards will apply?  Does he not agree that the agency will suggest the standards it will draw up should be implemented?No one in the House would condone the pollution or contamination of water.  Everyone agrees that there is a need to put in place a set of standards for wastewater treatment facilities throughout the country.  However, we are seeking a system that is fair and equitable.  Numerous Deputies on all sides have stated that when the guidelines are published, we must ensure arrangements to provide financial assistance will be put in place immediately rather than at a later stage.  It must be written into the legislation that financial assistance will be provided for those who will be obliged to upgrade their wastewater treatment systems.  The meeting I attended last night was addressed by an independent and very reputable engineer who stated it would cost in the region of €8,000 to €10,000 to upgrade wastewater treatment systems in County Westmeath.  From where are people going to obtain that kind of money?  Why is it that people who live in cities, towns and villages that are serviced by wastewater treatment facilities are not obliged to pay additional charges in order to have these facilities upgraded?  However, those living in rural areas will, as matters stand, be forced to put their hands in their pockets.  Those to whom I refer do not have the money to carry out upgrades.  Before the legislation is enacted, there will be a need to indicate, in comprehensive terms, the funding that will be made available to them.

Under the 2007 Act, the penalties are €15 million in fines and five years in prison if one does not comply with the standards relating to water quality.  That is the record of the previous Government.  I will not be including any such regime under the Bill before the House.  People will be obliged to pay up to €5,000 in fines, but they will not be imprisoned.The revenue from the registration charge which I have repeatedly stated will be once-off in nature will be paid directly to local authorities and used to finance the operation of the legislation.  Deputy Mick Wallace can read into that what he will.

However, I will not be commencing the legislation until such time as the regulations have been approved.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1133	I know Deputy Martin Ferris is anxious to see them.I must inform Deputy Michael Healy-Rae that there is no confusion on my part.  If he is adding to people's confusion, that is his problem.  I will tell people the truth on any matters relating to rural areas.  We have engaged in 35 hours of debate on this legislation and I would have expected the Deputy to have heard me, on several occasions, clarifying many issues of concern to him and Deputy Martin Ferris.  Planning permission will not be required.  I am surprised the Deputy heard that for the first time today because I have said it about five or six times.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1134	I am not a member of the committee.

There will be no need to purchase additional land to comply with the legislation.  There will be no annual inspection charges or re-registration charges, as I mentioned in answering a parliamentary question from Deputy Michael Healy Rae yesterday.  There will be no 2009 EPA-type regulations as Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív wanted and Fianna Fáil wanted when in government.  There will be no army of inspectors.  I know Deputy Brian Stanley's party may be used to armies, but local authority staff are the ones who will be in charge.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1136	What is the Minister implying in mentioning armies?

He has been referring all day to an army of inspectors.  There will be no army of inspectors.  Local authority staff are the only ones who will be in charge of this.

Deputies Seán Crowe, Brian Stanley, Mick Wallace, Thomas Pringle and several others, including the Member for east Cork, mentioned the possibility of group sewerage scheme grants being increased.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I was prepared to look at this.  There are many ribbon developments along the road in County Roscommon and elsewhere in respect of which people would like to receive additional financial support in order to bring them into public schemes.  I said on Committee Stage that I was prepared to look at this issue during the course of 2012.  Nobody has done this that before.

We are fortunate that the regulations proposed by the previous Government fell with the general election; otherwise some of the costs about which Deputy Troy heard last night would have been introduced.  It would cost €10,000 to complete the necessary upgrades; every septic tank would be inspected and we would have to comply with the 2009 EPA regulations.  That is not what we are going to do under this Bill.  I am not going to do what Fianna Fáil wanted to do when in government.I announced funding of €22 million for many water schemes in rural Roscommon in the last few months.  Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan did not mention this.  A lot of money has been allocated to Connemara and County Roscommon since I became Minister, about which nobody else seemed to be bothered, to deal with many of the outstanding rural infrastructural problems in water and sewerage services.  The figure is €22 million for County Roscommon and €38 million for Galway West.

He has been picking numbers off the top of his head for the last six months.  We are concentrating on areas of high risk.  The issue of financial support will be considered when we know the extent of the problem.  We will not know this until inspections have been carried out.The spirit of the amendment tabled by Deputy Collins meets exactly what I suggested I would do on Committee Stage.  I have checked it legally and been told that I cannot accept the wording.  That is all that is between us.  However, I agree with the spirit of the amendment which is in line with the commitment I gave on Committee Stage.  I think Deputy Ó Cuív said we were making progress when I said that.

He said there would be no financial hardship, but he will not tell us what the position is.  He has made reference to a blank cheque.  What does he mean by this?  He has stated he will put in place a grant process to help those who have to carry out remedial treatment works to their septic tank, but that is not the same as providing a blank cheque.  It is a commitment that people will not be out of pocket through no fault of their own as a result of the introduction of the new standards and regulations that he will bring forward.  That is all I am asking, but he will not answer the question.It is so frustrating sitting here.  People call it gobbledygook or bullshit.  Please, excuse my language.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1175	The Deputy will withdraw that word.

They can call it whatever they want, but it is frustrating having to sit here and being told that it is the same as providing a blank cheque.  That is not what a grant procedure is.  Did farmers avail of a grant procedure?  All the Minister has to say is that he is prepared to initiate a grant procedure to help those who will find themselves in difficulty as a result of having to undertake remedial treatment works following inspections.  It is as simple as that.  Will the Minister do this?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1177	He did say that.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	Deputy Tom Hayes is not speaking.  He is on the wings.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1183	The Minister will respond.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1184	I ask the Minister if he is going to introduce a grant procedure?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1185	Thank you.  Has Deputy Seamus Healy spoken twice?
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1186	No; I will be brief.  If the Minister was genuine, he could solve the problem by agreeing to defer the Bill until the consultation process has been completed and the draft regulations have been brought to the House for debate.  There is no need for the Bill to be passed this week.  It is clear that the information the Minister for Education and Skills gave to the House on 12 January is incorrect.  We do not have to pass the legislation by 3 February.  The earliest date when difficulties will arise will be sometime in the summer.  If the Minister is being genuine about the regulations, it is open to him to defer the legislation and bring it back before the House in the summer when the consultation process has been completed, the regulations have been drafted and there will be an opportunity for everyone to debate them.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1187	I agree with the Deputy.  In fairness to the Minister, he seems to be working in the dark.  He does not seem to know what he will do with septic tanks, how many will need work, what it will cost and how much he has to spend.  We seem to be doing things backwards.  It would be a great idea to take a look first.  Surely it would have been much easier for the Minister to work forward.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1188	We need the legislation to do that.

I apologise if I am going on about funding again, but the Minister mentioned there would be no financial hardship.  I am curious to know what the answer is.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1190	The Deputy will know when the regulations are being implemented.  The number of inspections carried out in 2013 will indicate the level of hardship or otherwise in complying with the regulations.  Only then can we consider the question of financial assistance that will be required.

I will repeat that I do not envisage anybody being in financial difficulty because of this.  Mechanisms are in place to help people, but we cannot assess the matter properly until the inspections are carried out and we see the extent of the problem.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1197	When we started to analyse the Bill in October, I made out the issues to be addressed.  One is the abolition of the registration charge and another is clarity on how inspections will be funded because local authorities have stated they do not have the money.  Another issue is the abolition of the appeal fee.  We have made progress on these issues, but we must push them over the line.In fairness to the Minister, we have also made progress on the issue of standards.  At least he is now saying - if I understand him correctly - that on foot of an amendment tabled by Deputy Niall Collins public and Oireachtas consultation will take place on the standards to apply to maintenance and upgrading prior to the Bill and registrations being commenced.  If he confirms this today, it will be another small step on what has been a tortuous road in dealing with the issues I raised last October.The Minister has confirmed that planning permission will not be required.  I have not had a chance to check the section under which the Minister has stated he can implement this.  I will check, but I would like the Minister to speak on the issue now.  He has also firmly committed on numerous occasions on the floor of Dáil Éireann to ensuring nobody will have to purchase any land to comply with the legislation, even if all of his or her septic tank is located on a neighbour's land.  I do not know how he will do this because he has not shown us, but he has given this commitment to which he will be held by all of us on this side of the House.  This is a step in the right direction.  However, we need confirmation on several other issues on which we have tabled amendments.  These include a commitment that no environmental screening or environmental impact analysis will be needed.When all of these issues are dealt with, one outstanding issue will remain and it is a very simple one.  It is amazing to hear the Minister state he cannot give the people a blank cheque.  The honest answer is that a blank cheque is given without any cost to the people living in urban Ireland that all such systems will be brought up to EU standards because otherwise the Minister will be fined, as he knows.  What he is stating is he cannot state that if he does it for urban dwellers because the European would be on his tail, he will also have to do it for rural dwellers because there must be equality for everybody.  The people whom he is asking to write a blank cheque are the ordinary people of rural Ireland who are being asked to do so without knowing what standards will be applied.The Minister keeps telling us the standards will not be onerous.  Section 70L states clearly that the standards the Minister will lay down are those that will be advised to him by the agency.  He knows that if the agency proposes higher standards than he has introduced, the NGOs will be on the first aeroplane to Brussels to state he did not accept the advice of the expert agency in the country which was legally obliged to advise him.  He is asking us to believe it will tell us the document it produced in 2009 is only rubbish; that the ordinary people of Ireland do not need to comply with it; that if all someone has is a hole in the ground that was dug in 1950, all that person must do is comply with the standards that applied at the time, which was nothing; and that if that person must upgrade his or her system, he or she will not be told to what standard it must be done.  That is absolute nonsense and he knows it.We had an easy way to resolve this dispute.  I find it difficult to see how the EPA will advise the Minister to ditch the 2009 document which specifically states it refers to upgrades as well as existing systems.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1203	Section 70L states:The Minister may, following consultation with the Agency, make regulations for the purposes of this Part, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the regulations may make provision for—(a) maintenance plans for domestic waste water treatment systems,(b) performance standards for domestic waste water treatment systems,(c) standards and procedures to apply in relation to emptying a domestic waste water treatment system and the disposal of the waste water and sludge derived therefrom...Appendix G of the 2009 document outlines the EPA's prescription for maintenance works.The Minister will be legally obliged to consult the agency.  He knows that when a Minister must legally consult an expert agency such as the EPA, it is at his or her peril - it has been a problem for Ministers in the past - if he or she proposes standards lower than those proposed by the agency.  In this case I guarantee, from long experience living in Connemara, that if the Minister proposes lower standards people will be on the next aeroplane to Brussels to complain about him and the European Union will back them.The reason we are here is the ruling of the European Court of Justice, even though we were tackling in a very systematic way the problem of groundwater pollution by tackling the major sources such as agriculture and municipal wastewater systems.  It would be well worth the Minister's while reading the analysis made for me on water quality in Ireland which shows that between 2004 and 2006 municipal sewage discharges were the cause of 18 major incidents.  The inclusion of diffuse urban sources brings the number to 20.  This concerns the removal of sewage by pipe rather than by tanker.  There were no major incidents relating to single houses.  Municipal sewage discharges were the cause of 129 incidents involving moderate pollution, while 25 were caused by diffuse urban sources, bringing the combined total to approximately 150.  On-site wastewater treatment systems, including industrial systems, were the cause of two incidents involving moderate pollution.  Municipal sewage discharges were involved in 160 incidents involving slight pollution, while the total number caused by diffuse urban sources was 177.  Domestic and on-site water treatment systems, including industrial systems, accounted for six cases.  The Government was investing where the big problems were to be found.

However, those in Europe were not happy with that.  They told us that despite the fact that we are going about this systematically and focusing on the major problem, it was not good enough and that we had to register every system in the country.  If the Minister thinks that Europe is registering every system for the sake of ensuring they all comply with European standards under the 2007 waste directive, he is delusional.  It was for that reason we believed the ordinary people of rural Ireland must be firewalled against a possible cost that European law might impose on them if a high standard was to be imposed, but also if a low standard was proposed.To ensure we can discuss this again, and we are still not any clearer-----

In page 5, to delete lines 7 and 8.This amendment involves two clear issues, one of which is the removal of the omnibus section which provides for the making of regulations.  As I have explained the reasons previously, I will not elaborate ad nauseam  on my objection to such provisions which tend to be used extensively to create further regulations.  The other issue involved is the elimination of the registration fee.  The Minister has told us that it will be a once-off fee of €50 forever more.  He is putting in place this legal mechanism and, according to him, all that will ever be collected is €50 on a once-off basis.  Multiplying 475,000 by €50 works out at a figure of at less than €30 million which the Department of Social Protection would spend in less than three hours on one day.  If the one-off charge of €50 is to remain forever, why is the Minister setting up a legal mechanism for a charge that, in the reality of State finances, is a drop in the ocean?  Why go to the bother of collecting this fee that will yield less than €30 million?  As the Minister has rowed back repeatedly on the fee but is leaving it there, my legitimate suspicion is that he has been advised to leave some figure in the legislation because it can be raised and changed in the future by a simply amendment.My second objection, and the second reason for the amendment, is that it is extraordinary that the only people who have to register and pay for registering are the third of the country who have done everything for themselves until now.  The two thirds of the population who live in the towns, villages and cities, who have always had basic provisions and upgrades done for free-----

Anyone who built a new house and connected it to the system paid an average, in recent times, of €2,000 in development charges.Many of Deputy Mitchell's constituents will be affected by this legislation if they have holiday homes in the west.  She had better warn them of what is coming down the track because I do not think they have kept their eyes on that particular ball.  Knowing this part of Dublin as she and I know it, I can assure her that many people with holiday homes will be affected.

I do not understand the premise that urban people - I am an urban person by upbringing myself - should have a greater right than rural people to have their waste water taken away and treated and the system upgraded and maintained for free.  I do not understand that premise, because we all pay tax on the same basis.  I, as a Deputy, pay the same tax as Deputy Mitchell.  In fact, I pay more taxes than she does.

A serious point of fundamental equity is being debated.  The Minister is introducing a new inequity between urban and rural people.  He is the one who is creating the urban/rural divide because he is saying that anyone who lives in septic tank land will have to pay the €50 registration charge and anyone who lives in urban land will not.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell.  It is wrong to create these urban/rural divides.

The amount of money this fee will yield is minuscule.  It will never be collected again from anyone who registers now.  His only chance of any new source of income is from people building new houses.  The Minister has come a long way.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1261	No thanks to Deputy Ó Cuív.

If he does not, everyone will believe this provision is being left for the good public service reason that if any sum is included in primary legislation it is very easy to change the figures in a minor amendment in the future.  The game is not worth the candle in terms of national finances.  The Minister knows that.  It would not keep sewerage systems in towns and villages going for two hours.Therefore, I suggest that the Minister allow me to tick off one other item on the shopping list I had last November when the Bill was published.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1263	Deputy Ó Cuív has been making it up every day as he goes along.

I apologise, a Cheann Comhairle, for not addressing the Chair.  It is very provocative when the Minister interjects.

It would be a major step forward to get rid of this very minor provision, if we can trust the Minister, and I presume we can, that all he ever meant was that someone would pay €50 once and never again.  I ask the Minister to reassure us on that point by abolishing the fee in total.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1267	The €50 fee will not bring in any significant revenue.  The Minister mentioned €17 million.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1269	The Sinn Féin amendment proposes that the fee be abolished.  If the fee is in the legislation it can be increased at any time by ministerial order.  That is the thin end of a thick wedge.  There will be no €50 charges for anything in this country.  One would get very little for €50 if one was dealing with a statutory agency or with a governmental or any other body.  The fear is that the fee will be increased.In an earlier debate I referred to the people in Parnell cottages.  I see the Minister is laughing.

If the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform were taking this issue seriously, they would be in attendance.

People throughout the State are agog with disbelief about the Government's decision to hand over this amount of money.  The failure of an individual who plays a particular role - he has been identified already - to attend the debate is a disgrace.  We are handing €1.5 billion to unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders today.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1294	It is €1.25 billion.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1295	It is a huge amount of money to take out of the State.  I will explain the normal way the multiplier works.  Every €1 invested in the economy normally adds up to a multiplier of €1.25 over the course of a year.  Over four years one would expect a sum of approximately €4 to develop from one's initial investment of €1.  As the reverse is also the case, we will have a negative in this instance.  Therefore, the Government's decision to hand €1.5 billion to bondholders will have a negative effect, to the tune of €5 billion, on the economy over four years.  Jobs, wages and wealth will be lost to the economy.  It reveals as a lie the Government spin to the effect that its primary goal is job creation.  The primary goal of any Government can be identified by examining the resource levels invested in various areas.  The Government's decision to put more resources into bailing out the banks than into any other area demonstrates that its primary goal is bailing out the banks, rather than job creation.I would like to clear up a number of untruths spun by the Government in recent times to deflect attention from its shameful payment of €1.25 billion to bondholders.  It has stated the troika has forced it to take this action, but that is plainly untrue.  Paying unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders does not form part of the memorandum of understanding.  The only reference to bondholders in the memorandum is in the Government's desire to impose discounts on subordinated junior bondholders.  The troika will not withdraw the money we are due to borrow under the Government programme if we do not pay these bondholders.  If it were to do so, it would be breaking the agreement we reached with it.  When that point is made to the Government, it usually shifts its position.  It claims that the European Union and the ECB have forced it to pay bondholders, even if it is not in the memorandum of understanding.  Its argument is that it cannot upset the ECB on this issue because it has provided massive liquidity for Irish banks.  If we leave aside the fact that Anglo Irish Bank is a dead bank and the reality that commercial debt should be dealt with in a commercial fashion, the simple truth remains that Ireland is unable to deal with its level of debt while repaying these bondholders.The Greek Government is renegotiating a discount of up to 70% with private sector bondholders, and the ECB is not withdrawing liquidity from Greece.  We are fulfilling our requirements over and above what Greece is doing.  Why should we be treated any differently?  If the plug was pulled on the provision of liquidity for Irish banks, it would create financial armageddon across the European banking system.  The link between Irish and European banks was the reason this liquidity was provided in the first place.  Will the European Union create financial armageddon in Europe if commercial debt is not repaid?  I do not think so.The Government has also made the point that Ireland should not want to be like Greece, in the sense of having the word "default" written on our heads.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, entered into negotiations with the ECB this week on the possibility of a reduction in some of our banking debt - the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes - the sovereign bond market rate was approximately 6%.  We were being punished by the markets not because we had threatened to default or because of an inability to pay but because of the fantasy of the suggestion that we would be unable to pay all our debt.  It is clear that we cannot do so.The Government has claimed that the Opposition, in arguing that we should not pay these bonds, is failing to explain how we would be able to meet the immediate requirement to make up the deficit if the troika was to take away our funding.  I have dealt with the troika issue by clarifying that this is not covered in the memorandum of understanding.  Our objective is to remove the troika by returning to the markets.  If Ministers had read our pre-budget submission which was costed by the Department of Finance, they would know that our policies which we would implement after negotiating a new memorandum of understanding would lead to a quicker deficit reduction than through the Government's approach.  In addition, it would happen in a more sustainable way.  Our policies would help the economy to grow, whereas the Government's policies are strangling it.  The Government would have us sign up to an anti-investment austerity treaty in Europe which will mean austerity budgets in perpetuity.  Sinn Féin wishes to see our budgets decided democratically and on the basis of our economic cycle, not the election cycle of France and Germany.Nobel prize-winning economists have stated the route the Government is taking is leading to an austerity suicide.  It is crucial that at this time the Government does not become the textbook lesson for future students of economics on how to train-wreck a whole economy.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1296	Go raibh maith agat a Chathoirligh.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion tonight and I commend the Technical Group for putting it forward.  It is a timely motion, given the Government's hand-over today.  I commend the work of the range of groups and individuals who have organised to highlight this completely unreasonable, irrational and illogical position being taken by the Government.  These include, among others, Bondwatch, the Ballyhea group, the Chattering Magpie, Namawinelake, the Fermoy group in my own area and the over-arching Not Our Debt group.  Their efforts to raise awareness of this complex and technical area is welcome as is their commitment to resist it at every turn.  The pressure they can bring to bear on Government will be important.  They will need the support of Members in this House and tonight's vote provides us with a chance to voice our opposition to the Government's failed economic strategy.  It gives Fine Gael and Labour Deputies the chance to change course.The idea that this Government actually believes that paying this money is sensible, is tantamount to economic madness.  It seems the negotiating position is analogous to a person sitting down with the bank manager and saying, "I can pay my bills. I can meet the repayments and I can pay on time.  Now would you mind giving me a better deal?"  It is preposterous.The implication of December's budget is starting to hit home.  Pupil-teacher ratios, household charges, water taxes, septic tank charges, changes to tax credits, social welfare payments; the list goes on.  Families are really struggling.  There is no work to be found yet this Government claims it is renegotiating a more jobs-friendly deal with the troika but this is not happening.  Young people in their late teens and twenties are leaving in their droves.  Housing, health, education and social welfare systems are experiencing severe pressure.With regard to health service alone, one gets the sense that we are at breaking point.  The Government's strategy seems to be a chaotic one.  Communities across my own area have been up in arms about the handling of acute and emergency care services.  Emergency and pre-emergency care in the HSE south region, with the looming threat to the accident and emergency department at Mallow General Hospital and plans to cut ambulance cover for vast rural communities, is leaving people very worried.  This is compounded by the fact that plans to cut community nursing home beds will leave our elderly and infirm in a very vulnerable position.In my home town of Youghal, as a direct result of this Government's economic strategy, the local community hospital faces bed closures.  The exodus at the end of February, retirements, the recruitment embargo and the HSE's plan to close almost 900 community nursing home beds, are the reasons.  St. Francis nursing home in Fermoy is also a casualty.  The decisions will have a devastating effect on the quality of life of individuals, families and communities and they should be resisted at every opportunity.The Government is intent on paying back the debt of speculators and gamblers at the expense of our most weak and defenceless.  The language of the Taoiseach and other Cabinet members this week has been significant.  The contention that they have delivered anything of significance is almost laughable, €10 billion saved over the lifetime of the programme.  It is like Fine Gael and Labour turned up to the aftermath of a hurricane with a dustpan and brush.  The dustpan and brush approach is failing.  All of the important economic and social indicators say this.Anglo Irish Bank is a dead bank and the market solution is that these bonds should not be paid.  Even ignoring the market, the simple truth remains that Ireland has to plead inability to pay these bonds, for the sake of the people.  The Greek Government is currently negotiating a discount of up to 70% with bondholders in the private sector and the ECB has not withdrawn liquidity.  We are fulfilling programme requirements over and above what the Greeks are doing.  We cannot be treated any differently.When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, entered into negotiations with the ECB this week on a reduction in some of our banking debt, the sovereign bond market rates fell to under 6%.  We were punished by the markets not because we threatened default and our inability to pay but rather because we said we would pay everything when it is clear we cannot do so.  We seem constantly beholden to the markets but it seems they can see through this Government.  Now might be a good time to start listening to the people.

The motion is couched in a particular language because of the fear of putting down or of being identified with a motion to default.  Anybody wishing to talk about the language of default in Ireland should speak to the labour congress in Iceland or some of the shop stewards in Iceland about the tone of default and I am sure this would result in a very different attitude.  I suggest one should speak to the teachers' unions in Iceland about the state of their wages since they ran into their difficulties.  The Sinn Féin view on the alternative of default will lead to misery.I note one significant omission from the motion.  It suggests we should not pay this money.  I was hoping the second part of this riddle could be answered, which is the €1.5 billion payment which requires to be met every month and which is due in the next few days.  The motion does not address this nor does it say that we should not pay those concerned.  Why does it not call for the refusal to pay this €1.5 billion monthly sum?  It will be difficult for the people who have moved this motion to explain to nurses in hospitals or teachers in schools where the money will come from.  However, they will very cleverly avoid getting themselves into that situation.I refer to some of the Members who signed this motion.  One would need a neck made of Wicklow granite to call for a default.  Some of those who signed the motion were here on the night of the Anglo Irish Bank bailout, which has been referred to in this debate.  People freely made a decision to bail out probably the most rotten bank in the world that has cost us billions since and now they present this motion talking about why we should default.  Where was their conscience the night of the bailout in September 2008?  Some or those who signed this motion did not even turn up for the vote but they do not mind putting down a motion tonight which in reality encourages defaulting - but they cannot say that.  I do not know how people can live with this inconsistency.  They should take a hard look at what they did in September 2008 in supporting Anglo Irish Bank.I doubt if there is a Member of this Parliament who in reality would want to pay this money that has been paid today but it is the lesser of two evils.  If the people want to come forward next week with a Private Members' motion on default, we will sort this out for once and all but default will put us back and put this country back where it was in 1913, when those at the bottom of the social class had no shoes on their feet.  This is what the default will lead to.  The lesser of two evils has happened.  I will vote against the motion.

We are all in agreement that what we are being asked to do is a pretty obnoxious deed.  Nobody would pretend that what we are being asked to do is fair, right and just and would happen under any circumstances other than those in which we find ourselves today.  I have heard much about septic tanks today but we are effectively talking about what was and still is in many people's minds a septic bank.  When this period of history is written in 50 or 100 years, Anglo Irish Bank will be written all over it.I know to my cost and that of the community which first politicised me in the Dublin docklands what Anglo Irish Bank was all about.  There is a little school there where I worked and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority promised it a new building.  Two members of Anglo Irish Bank were on the board of that authority.  This was only three or four years ago but people should remember the magic dust that these people sprinkled on this country, which was incredible.  One could not, in all seriousness, question anything that these big developers, builders and businessmen were doing.  Everything seemed wonderful and they kept their businesses ramped up.  The Glass Bottle Company site in Ringsend was identified as an ideal site and the authority became involved in a partnership with a third party development, funded by Anglo Irish Bank.  Some €400 million was spent on the Glass Bottle Company site and it is now worth €34 million.  The promissory note my school got for a new school building went up in dust, and for the foreseeable future it is condemned to an 1840s-era building.Many people have been betrayed by the bank and the crazy attitudes surrounding it.  It goes against everything I know to be just or right to stand in the Parliament like this and speak in favour of what we are doing.  As Deputy Maloney has quite rightly said, I know we are effectively talking about putting a €30 billion promissory note process on the table in the hope that we win €1.25 billion, all the while understanding that we have €147 billion of ECB money in our banking system.  I do not gamble.

We may lose this battle on the €1.25 billion, and it is right and just that we in this Chamber at every opportunity have the right to discuss the process.  Payments like this should not happen without having a proper discussion or debate through the likes of a private Member's motion.  That is the way Parliament should work and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue.  This is something about which the public will want a very tight explanation.  Unfortunately, we have little more to say than that we do not think it worth the gamble.Effectively, we are looking at a process of working with our European partners on something that is much more valuable, which is deconstructing the promissory note and changing it so we get some real change for this country.  What would happen if we defaulted on this or previous payments?  The European Central Bank, ECB, might have found it interesting as it has €110 billion in the Irish banking system at 1%, and it may have increased the interest rate.  What would happen in that case and how could it be explained to the people who are rightly protesting and want to know what on Earth the Government is doing?This is something we inherited and it is not of our making.  Nobody in this Chamber would agree that this is the fault of the Fine Gael-Labour Administration.  We are dealing with the issue as we find it, although we are not happy about it.  The bigger game is the €30 billion figure, and I am not somebody willing to win a battle to lose a war.  We should be careful about the information we send to our constituents when we are, correctly, discussing this payment to the unsecured and unguaranteed Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1308	I understand why the motion was tabled and I agree with other speakers in that there is nobody in the House or the Chamber that is not sick to the stomach at the prospect of paying this money to the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  The truth is that the day Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised, that bank debt became sovereign debt forever.  People argue that this is not our debt but that is not true, although we wish it was not our debt.  Making it our debt was a catastrophic mistake for all of us but it is now our debt.  By all the laws governing civilised nations in international affairs, it is our debt.We could renege, as is suggested in this motion, but there would be consequences.  I know there has been a great deal of debate about such consequences but in truth, none of us know them.  Perhaps the troika would pull down the curtain and end the money supply, perhaps it would put more onerous conditions in place or perhaps it would make the money dearer.  It could be any or all these possibilities.  We should bear in mind that when we got the bailout, it was largely to prevent a default.  There was a fear about our defaulting and the impact of this on other countries and their banks, so we know for certain that the troika feels strongly enough about defaults to give us a bailout.  The kinds of pared services that are now possible would not be possible in the event of a default.People have said that the markets have no memory and that within weeks, there would be lending to Ireland, which is true.  However, that would come at a very high price.  It is not true to say markets have no memory as credit histories count, for individuals and countries; they are not forgotten and are priced into what is charged for every penny lent.  The markets would only lend money to Ireland at a very high price for a very long time.  Does anybody really believe that if we decided not to pay our debts today, it would not frighten the ECB, which is exposed by more than €100 billion to Irish banks?  It is charging a pittance in interest on that money so do Deputies not believe it is worried about it already?  It would be very worried if we indicated that we would not pay our bills.  I know how I would react if people told me they would not pay their debts but would like to keep borrowing anyway.  If Deputies believe the banks are strapped for cash now, imagine what would happen if the shutters came down and the consequent impact on the economy.This morning Deputy Ross suggested that we should default like Argentina and that we would be back in the markets in no time.  That country returned to the markets a few years after default but it went through absolute hell.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Creed, was in Argentina in 2003 and has an abiding memory not from the slums but in boulevards of the capital city, where people sat on footpaths trying to sell furniture.  That was outside the houses most had already lost.  That was their reality; we believe we are in purgatory but those people suffered hell for quite a long time.  There are consequences.It would be irresponsible at this stage, having repaid nine tenths of the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank, most of it by the previous Government, suddenly to decide now we are not going to pay the last tenth.  We have taken the pain.  We have perhaps got some of the credit for that with the people who are lending to us, but not to pay the last one tenth would be stupid apart from anything else.I will not go into detail on the promissory notes of €3 billion because it would be purely irresponsible to suggest not repaying it, but I hope whoever advised the late Minister, Mr. Brian Lenihan, on that kind of device to pay his bills did not get any kind of golden handshake because it is such an onerous arrangement that it is usury.  It is approximately €17 billion on €30 billion.  The Government is correct to go back to Europe to say that we were early movers to save the banks and we did it under intense pressure from Europe to save their banks.  We paid too high a price and Europe must respond to that now.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1309	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I echo what was suggested previously, that we follow this Private Members' debate with another one on default because that is, in effect, what the Technical Group is seeking, even though it has chosen to muddy the waters with its selective phraseology on dirty bankers and the other language its members use.  They are trying to equate the payments to bondholders with cuts to hospitals and schools.  Speakers have muddied the waters and created much angst.  I congratulate them on that.  If that is what they were looking for, they have achieved something.  Many hard-pressed people are very annoyed, angry and frustrated with this added pressure.  I say well done to them on that.I urge the members of the Technical Group to do the responsible thing.  They were elected to this House and in that regard they should show a small bit of leadership and inform people on the facts, not on the cheap, popular headlines they have sought to date.  They should be honest and tell people as it is.  They should do the decent thing and follow up this Private Members' debate with one next week to the effect that we as a State would default on our debt.  It is one and the same thing.  The debt we have inherited from Anglo Irish Bank is a State debt.I do not know why the Technical Group has chosen to hone in on this issue other than that it is popular because it relates to bankers.  We also owe a huge debt to the European Central Bank, ECB, and a massive debt to the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  Why is the Technical Group not asking us to default on those debts?  Debt is debt.  The Members opposite know how the Irish Credit Bureau works.  If someone defaults on any debt, his or her credit rating goes down.  It does not matter whether it was a loan for a holiday or to educate one's children.  Once one defaults, one defaults.  If the Technical Group wants the State to default, then its Members should put it up to the Government to default.  We would welcome such a debate because it would be an opportunity to deal with people head-on, to tell them the truth and the facts they need to hear.The fact is that this country has a €12 billion deficit.  I read Deputy Boyd Barrett's pre-budget submission and listened to the proposals he made.  Watching people play the game of Twister makes more sense than listening to him explain how a wealth tax would bridge the divide.  A wealth tax is a permanent asset.  It is a stagnant asset.  One cannot keep taxing it indefinitely.  We might get a return in one year by putting a 30% or 40% tax on the wealth which the Deputy cannot make up his mind exists today.  We might get over the hill in one year.  We could raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  That is all very well.  If the Members of the Technical Group had been put in government 12 months ago and had introduced a wealth tax and raided the National Pensions Reserve Fund, one must ask where we would go from there.  Both of those sources of income would be gone and we would rely on the troika, the ECB, the IMF or the EU to keep this country going for the next 12 months.  Or else they could reduce the €12 billion with a once-off budget.  That is the stark reality of the choices facing this country.  I resent the hyperbole and hysteria that the Technical Group is generating throughout the country in the past two days for cheap political gain and to glorify its own ends.Austerity has become the new dirty word.  It is an awful pity we did not have austerity in this country ten years ago.  Austerity is merely cutting one's cloth to suit one's measure.  It does not have to be a dirty word.

As everyone has stated, it sticks in the craw to pay Anglo Irish Bank bondholders what we did, but the alternative is so stark that we have no choice given that we must restore balance to the public finances.  The Government is slowly achieving that but it will not be achieved overnight.  There will not be any instant solutions.  We are engaged in a programme of reform which will restore the economy over a period, as Deputy Jim Daly has indicated.Those who suggest we default or who are in the default mode should reflect on the outcome where default has occurred.  Reference has been made to the Argentinean experience.  Last year I looked closely at what happened in Argentina.  The economists are correct; if we do something like that we will correct the economy in three to four years but one must not ignore the social ramifications and the pain people would have to endure.  We would be at almost famine levels.  It would be so irresponsible that under no circumstances could we even imagine the effect of such an approach as to default and not be able to bridge the €12 billion deficit, to which previous speakers referred.The debate on default is ongoing.  It might be an economic solution but for a start it would destroy our international reputation, on which we depend as an open economy.  There would be serious implications for life opportunities and the standing of our citizens.  Were we to default it is likely we would be thrown out of the eurozone and revert to the punt.  Some people promote such an approach.  The value of the Irish currency would collapse, thereby causing a currency crisis, as occurred in Argentina.  A default would probably result in the value of savings being wiped out and make it impossible for people to get their hands on such savings.  If this country defaults on its foreign debt and reintroduces the punt, most of the money in bank accounts would be in punts rather than euro and, as such, given the economic situation in the country, the value of the punt would plummet, the value of savings would decrease and the currency would depreciate.  People with life savings in credit unions would find their value diminished.  The cost of foreign goods and services would increase.  There would be a devaluation in the value of the currency of between 50% and 70%, as occurred in Argentina.  All imports, including 50% of supermarket purchases, would increase by 50% to 70%, as would all other imports and, as an open economy, that would have serious effects.

That is what those who propose a default are suggesting.  It is irresponsible.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1317	I value speaking in the debate, although the timing is poor.  I have no doubt that it is a simple request but the scenario is complex.  The timing is poor because today this country re-entered the bond markets - quite successfully at 5.15%.  Nobody would have predicted that up to now.  That is not bad but I do not hear any praise for it.One must recognise that the Government is steady in its approach and consistent in the way it does its business.  I know the wrongs that were perpetrated.  I felt them more than many of the Members sitting looking across at me.  I almost lost my business on the back of Anglo Irish Bank's false banking and backing people to own big portions of the sugar industry who eventually sold out through greed.  I do not need lessons from Members on the far side of the House.  When one's house is on the line, one knows all about it.  Let us not go back to the past.  Who owns the bonds is irrelevant.  They are bonds and that is it.  Discussing their owners is populist.Returning to the market today shows there is market confidence, something that is vital.  I run a business and am not about to be lectured by people who do not know how to create jobs.  Creating jobs takes a great deal of effort and work.  One builds a reputation over many years.  If one defaults once, that is it - one is gone.  People view the business as unreliable and the person as being someone who will cod them at some stage.  Gambling never worked and I am not a gambler.  We need to ensure consistency in our approach.For those Members who have heard of Edmund Burke, he said we should not consult our invention, but with our past.  This is important.  Regarding the land annuities, the Government of the time decided we should not repay the loans the British provided to Irish farmers.  We did not pay them, but we still collected the money from farmers.  In 1932, 90% of our trade was with England.  All of a sudden, prices for our cattle and commodities decreased and we were in major economic difficulty.  This time was known as the Economic War.  After six years, we tucked our tails between our legs and repaid England £10 million to say, "Sorry".  By Jesus, we found ourselves in trouble in those few years.Remember the credit unions that wrote to their small investors last Christmas to tell them the unions could give them no money because the bondholders had been burned?  There are consequences to actions.When I see populism like this, it makes me cross.  I will stand by decisions that keep the people who work for me in their jobs.  It is all about job creation.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1318	I do no one a disservice when I say there is not a single person in the House who is entirely satisfied or comfortable with the events of noon today when we transferred funds to unnamed bondholders in the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  Given the volume of correspondence my colleagues and I have received from the public on this matter in recent days, it has not been a popular decision, but it is undoubtedly the correct decision.  In time, we will derive great benefit from the decision to honour our sovereign debts.For far too long, our predecessors made decisions on the basis of short-term political gains.  Thankfully, the policy of keeping an eye on the next general election has been confined to the history books.  During its short term in office, the Government has demonstrated numerous times that it is prepared to make difficult, unpopular and unpalatable decisions in the national interest.  Today's honouring of our obligations to the bondholders is one such decision.Everything the Government does is with a view to returning to international bond markets, as we did today, and relieving ourselves of the troika's assistance.  The Government has been successful in this regard.  Prior to the last general election, Irish bond yields stood at 14%.  The yield on those same bonds when we dipped our toe in the markets today was marginally over the 5% mark.  Bond yields have fallen sharply because of the Government's decisions since assuming office, including the honouring of our obligations to the bondholders.  Lest there be any doubt, failing to pay the bondholders would be catastrophic for our ability to return to the markets and for the rate of interest we would pay on bonds.National debt is forecast to hit €200 billion during the course of the next 12 months.  Each 1% reduction in bond yields that we achieve will result in a saving of €2 billion per annum.  The reality is that this is our debt and we must repay it.

Some members of the Technical Group suggest that we should aspire to the Greek model and attempt to achieve similar write-downs.  This would be catastrophic.  Some of the group's members remind me of the story of the Grand Old Duke of York and I have visions of Deputy Boyd Barrett or Deputy Higgins leading us on the march to the top of the hill.  When they discover what is occurring in Greece, they will not be long turning on their heels and marching right back down again.  Perhaps the Deputies might bring their colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath.  When he gets to the top of the hill and witnesses what is occurring in Greece, it might cause him to fill some of those famous septic tanks he is constantly discussing.Other misinformation suggests that the funds transferred today could have been used for other essential services.  That is absolute nonsense.  We are in a programme and borrowing money.  Indeed, we borrowed money to fund the bondholders today.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1324	To swap metaphors with the previous speaker, the Government side in this debate reminds me of the captain of the Italian ship that sank recently because he was so busy trying to impress his friends onshore that he could not face the fact of a massive gaping hole in the side of his ship or that it was going down.  The reality is that the Government is keeping the country on an unsustainable path, namely, paying off the gambling debts of bankers and speculators by crucifying our society and economy while trying to convince us it is somehow a good thing and the situation will right itself in the end.Lest there be a mistake, the suggestion is that we in the United Left Alliance are afraid of the word "default".  Let me say it - default, default, default.  Contrary to Deputy Walsh's suggestion, these are not our debts.  They are not the debts of pensioners, low and middle income families, the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs, the schoolchildren who have lost guidance counsellors, learning support teachers and language support teachers or the disadvantaged in our society.  They are the debts of bankers, speculators and people who are driven by nothing but greed and profit.  The Government is saying that the interests of speculators come before the interests of schoolchildren, families whose loved ones are getting on boats and aeroplanes to leave the country, people who are rotting on the dole and pensioners who are shivering with the cold this winter because of cuts in the fuel allowance.  I hope the Government will spare a thought for those people as it defends, justifies and spins the paying of €1.2 billion to speculators and bondholders while real human beings, not markets, suffer considerably.  Make no mistake.  The money paid today and the €3 billion the Government plans on paying at the end of March come directly from the pockets, livelihoods and services of ordinary working people and citizens who have no responsibility for the criminal actions that caused this economy to crash.What makes all of this worse is the fact that we are not even paying the bondholders who initially bought the bonds.  We are paying people who bought the bonds recently on the secondary market at a 30% or 50% discount.  The original bondholders burned themselves.  We would not, but they did.  The speculators and gamblers we paid today will make a profit of between 30% and 50%, some €300 million or €500 million.  Once again, the vulnerable, the workers and the people lose, but the speculators win handsomely.There were also the insurance companies, represented by the United States Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, who vetoed proposals to burn bondholders.  We did not discover this from the Government but through a leak from the United States Embassy.  Mr. Geithner, we learned, knew that people in this country were angry, but he did not deny that he had vetoed the proposals.  It is important to stress that it is not just the people of Ireland who are losing out as a consequence of this decision but also the people of Europe.  Everybody is suffering because of a decision by the political masters in Brussels, Paris and elsewhere in Europe, together with the political masters in this State, to sacrifice everything - our economic future, fairness and social justice - in order to pay off bankers and speculators.  All of this might possibly be justified if there were even a slight glimmer of hope that any of it is working.  There is no such glimmer.The Government is not even listening to what Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF is saying.  As she warned, loudly and clearly, before Christmas and as was repeated by the IMF yesterday, we are careering towards a 1930s-style depression.  All of the austerity measures that have been imposed have only made the situation worse.  It is an absolute lie to say the European Central Bank would retaliate to a decision not to repay these bondholders by cutting off liquidity funding to our banks.  The only reason it is providing that funding is that a failure to do so would, as well it knows, see the entire European financial system, including its banks, come crashing down.  That is the leverage we must use in standing up to these people.Unfortunately, the Government will not stand up to them because it buys into their agenda and into the dogma of markets which caused the financial crisis.  This crisis is being used to ram even more market dogma down the throats of people throughout Europe.  It will have the exactly the same result in other markets and other sectors of society as it has had in the financial markets.  In other words, it will lead us towards a depression.  The only responsible action for elected Deputies in this Chamber to take is to call the bluff of those who are using the politics of fear to intimidate people in this State into accepting austerity.  We must encourage people to resist, community by community and workplace by workplace.  Otherwise our society will suffer the consequences for generations.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1325	The Government has advised us on several occasions that actions have consequences.  I am well aware of that.  If the bank were to give me €10,000 tomorrow morning and I decided to lose it all in a bookmaker's shop, I realise there will be consequences to my actions.  If I lose, the bookmaker is not obliged to return my money.  On the other hand, the people to whom €1.25 billion was repaid today have been taught that there are essentially no consequences to their actions.  They took a risk which did not turn out as they hoped.  Some of them sold on the bonds, in some cases for as low as 54 cent in the euro.  Unlike somebody like me, who would not burn down the bookmaker's shop if my losing stake was not repaid, these people are repaid in any case.  If Paddy Power was being run by the Government it would be out of business by now.We are told that if we kick up a row about repaying these bonds we will be slapped on the wrist.  One Government Deputy observed that there is €110 billion in the banking system, put there by the European Central Bank, and if we do not repay this money the bank might raise the interest rate it is charging us.  The reality is that if that were to happen, we would be unable to repay any of the money.  We are the man or woman in the street who is sure the banker will tip his hat to us for fear we will not pay him back.  That argument has been going around for a long time.  It is an argument members of the Government were using before they came into power.  Unfortunately, that is now forgotten and they have become so responsible that they no longer run the country.  When I lived in Germany I never voted for Angela Merkel's party.  There was no opportunity for me to vote or not vote for her on this occasion, but the Government is letting her and Mr. Sarkozy run the country.  It promised to get tough with these people and to work for this country.  If it had done so, we would not have had the debate today on the Water Services (Amendment) Bill because there would be enough money to run the country without the need for such measures.I do no accept the scaremongering which says we will be locked out of the markets if we do not repay this money.  I know of several business people who found themselves unable to repay their debts in the past and were obliged to go out of business.  Over a period of years they went back into business and nobody had a problem with them.  People move on, just as the markets will move on.  They have already done so in the case of Iceland, with that country's credit rating now restored to health, thus allowing it once more to borrow on the markets.Some people argue that we cannot know the consequence of a failure to repay the bondholders.  However, there are certain facts of which we can be sure.  We will still be producing just as much food as we are now and there will be a demand for it from all corners of the planet.  People will still want to come to this country for tourism reasons.  The multinationals are not here for the craic or because we pay back debts we do not owe.  They are here for other reasons and those reasons will still apply following a default.  It will not all fall apart if we default, a word which some are afraid even to say.How will the Government succeed in terrifying people after it has put through the next several budgets?  The only threat that will be left in three years' time is that if we do not pay the bondholders we will not have enough money to pay the interest on our debts.  According to the figures from the Department of Finance, we will have a primary surplus in 2014.  The only fiscal deficit we will have in that year will be the interest we are paying.  How will the Government frighten us into submission then?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1326	Today, €1.25 billion was paid to unnamed and unguaranteed bondholders.  This country is being bled dry by Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and a conglomeration of hedge funds.  Reliable sources indicate these are the principal holders of the bonds.  Anglo Irish Bank is likely to end up costing the Irish taxpayer close to €50 billion by 2031, with future related borrowings and interest charges bringing the possible total bill to approximately €85 billion.  While Greece and Portugal are negotiating haircuts to their debts of more than 50%, Ireland is held to ransom and obliged to pay bondholders their full capital plus interest, which in some cases is charged at up to 8%.The taxpayer is being forced to pay through the nose for the reckless behaviour of Mr. FitzPatrick and Mr. Drumm.  Between 1978 and 2008 Anglo Irish Bank's loan book grew from IR £1 million to €78 billion.  To cover these loans, it bridged the gap by borrowing cheap money on the international markets and issuing bonds.  Many huge transactions were not approved by the board of directors and there were ad hoc arrangements whereby massive sums were approved over the telephone.  The regulator was gone missing at this stage and good ship Ireland was drifting towards the rocks.  This reckless and irrational borrowing by developers was facilitated by irresponsible lending on the part of banks, lending which amounted to acts of criminality.One of the most worrying aspects of all of this is that these people are still at large, whether abroad or still in this State, and are continuing to trade.  By contrast, we saw what happened in the United States where such persons were brought before the courts in a very public manner and the appropriate custodial sentences were handed down.  It irritates and disgusts the people that we have not acted in a similar manner to the authorities in America.  There is no sign on the horizon that this will happen.  Irish people are experiencing unprecedented hardship and the most vulnerable and helpless in society are bearing the brunt of all these wrongs.  The most extreme draconian measures are being inflicted on them to address the financial quagmire in which we find ourselves.No one envies the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in terms of the dilemma he faces.  Despite that the sum of €1.25 million was paid out today, I am sure we are all agreed that he, with the support of Government, should play tough and hard ball in the negotiations on the promissory note of €3.1 billion due to be paid at the end of March.  It is hoped the Government will be able to obtain a sizeable write-down in this.  If we do not secure a better deal or have our debt repayments spread out over a longer period, this country will remain deflated, with more unemployment, emigration and austerity measures of the type introduced during recent years.  If this continues, the backbone of the country will be broken.  It is hoped that will not happen.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1327	I refer to the troika's warning this week that a financial bomb would go off in Dublin if Anglo Irish Bank senior bondholders are not repaid.  This was a horrendous scaremongering tactic designed to create anxiety and panic among the people.  The implication that the troika holds a bomb that could decimate the Irish economy is shameful and wholly inappropriate.  It is emotive and threatening behaviour.  The people will not fall for this PR stunt.  They have more to be worried about given that the latest statistics show that 60,000 householders are in mortgage arrears, Irish householders now owe twice their income and 100 people a day are leaving the country.  All this despite the €20 billion plus we have already slashed in budgets.What is confusing and angering people is why, despite the harrowing austerity measures they are being forced to endure and our 14.4% unemployment rate - 18% in my constituency - the budget deficit remains static.  How can this be?  People have now realised the implications of the austerity measures, which bow before the greed of the bondholders.  Despite all their sacrifices and the cuts they have sustained, there is no improvement in their daily lives.  All we hear are warnings that we face more of the same for years to come.  People throughout the country are asking - Members of the Government must be hearing it too - why we are handing over to private bondholders and banks €1.2 billion, which we have no legal or moral obligation to pay.  The argument that we do so because we promised to is ludicrous and offensive to the people.  That is the only argument being made by the Government side.People are asking why, if the country is broke and they had to sustain cuts of €2.8 billion in the last budget, we are giving €750 million to unsecured bondholders.  Fine Gael promised prior to the last election that it would burn the bondholders and bring about change and reform in this area.  I have listened carefully to some of the words and phrases used in this debate, including "austerity", "default",  "zombie banks" and "not our debt".  Fine Gael used these words prior to the last election.  It came up with the word "austerity".  It accused the previous Government of implementing austerity measures.  It used the word "default" and the Labour Party most definitely used it.  There is no one here from the Labour Party, members of which used the word "default" on every television and radio programme.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when in Opposition used the phrase "zombie bank".

The people no longer believe the Government, members of which are deliberately trying to confuse them.  The Government has not succeeded.  The people believed Fine Gael and the Labour Party that they would not pay the bondholders because they told them so.  Both parties used the phrase "burn the bondholders" on television programmes and so on.I remind Members opposite of the criticism they fired at the Independents.  That was a bad mistake.  Each of them was elected with a sizeable majority.  We were elected based on what we told people, namely, that we would do everything in our power to ensure the bondholders were burned, to prove the Government wrong and to put it down because of what it was doing to the people.  This Government is destroying the economy and people's livelihood.  There are people who are hungry.  We recently gave money to a Greek bondholder who is a multimillionaire.  The Government needs to explain that to the people, including the people on the dole and the 100 people that will emigrate from our airports tomorrow morning.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party should be ashamed of themselves: they lied to the people.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1330	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important and urgent debate, in light of today's payment of €1.25 billion to unsecured bondholders.  While for me this is a huge issue, for the citizens of this State, it is a major drain on our economy.  It is important to have a clear and honest debate and less spin and waffle from this Government.  The people deserve better: they deserve the truth.I was a Member of the previous Dáil and witnessed first-hand senior bankers appearing before committees, conning politicians and misleading the people.  Their lending policies were economic vandalism of the worst sort.  At that time Members of this Government were very excited about payments to bondholders and so on.  Their high moral ground antics were breath-taking yet today they paid out €1.25 billion to those bondholders.  These bondholders are anonymous speculators, many of whom bought Anglo Irish Bank bonds at between 50% and 80% discount, who stand to make huge profits if paid full face value for those bonds.  This Government intends to make a further payment of €3.1 billion on a promissory note for the Anglo Irish Bank-Irish Nationwide Building Society debt on 31 March.  It will also make similar payments every year up to 2023 with further payments due after that.  This debate is about reality and the facts in regard to the banking crisis and bondholders.Last week, the Taoiseach said the growth rate for Ireland next year would be 1.3%.  My colleague, Deputy Ross, exposed the truth and, along with the IMF, said that growth would be 0.5%.  Did the Taoiseach come in here yesterday and today and accept that he got it wrong: he did not.  That is the type of leadership I will not accept.  It is dishonest leadership that should not be accepted.  The people had no hand in this debt, will not benefit from its repayment and do not consent to paying it.  That is the message I hear across my constituency every day.  The people do not consent to paying this debt.The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, also got it wrong last Sunday in relation to his comments on Denmark.  He did not put his hands up in acknowledgment either.  Denmark is now back in the markets.  We need to stand up to the ECB.  We need to tell it the truth.  Elements within the IMF accept the analysis of the Technical Group.  In addition, one should consider the real issues.  In the context of cutting expenditure, the Government should stop cutting DEIS schools or services to people with disabilities but should consider the ongoing waste in the public service.  For example, the Members opposite all jump up and down in respect of electronic voting machines about which the previous Government cocked up to the tune of €50 million.  Do they know it costs €145,000 per year to store the aforementioned machines?  Are they aware the State was forking out €500,000 to rent empty offices?  I challenged the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, on this issue.  I have cited two small examples but there is no logic to spending and wasting money.As for blaming mortgage payers and those who were hammered during the Celtic tiger years in respect of their apartments, flats and houses, I note the Taoiseach's brass neck in attacking people who are opposed to the household charge.  However, in 1994 Deputy Enda Kenny stated "It is morally [wrong,] unjust and unfair to tax a person's home".  This is the kind of politics I will not accept.  The people demand truth and an honest debate.  The Independent Group and the Technical Group in the Dáil are working hard to deliver such a debate.  The Government should get on with the issue, negotiate on behalf of this country, put on the Ireland jersey and deliver for the Irish people.  They deserve truth and honesty and, above all, they deserve respect.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1331	This time last year, people were short of only one thing, namely, the date for the general election.  They were about to head into a month of debate in which they listened to declarations that it was either Labour's way or Frankfurt's way and listened to the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, talk about not paying a cent more.  The Government should not lecture Opposition Members about rhetoric because it provided the Government with a large part of the majority it enjoys in this House.  This is because people paid attention.  Government Members visited the same doorsteps as did Opposition Members and know people were paying attention.  They did not talk about local issues on those doorsteps.  They expressed their unwillingness to take on board the responsibility for bank debts and certainly for unsecured bondholders.The point is it is now dead money, as of today, because it has gone and it is disgraceful that it was paid.  The bondholders must be the luckiest people ever, as what happened today is the equivalent of someone giving them the winning lotto numbers.  It was noted earlier that these bonds were even traded on the secondary markets.  While the Government may not wish to know who these people are, I wish to know who they are, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the 40,000 households in my constituency.  I wish to know to whom the €700 per household is being paid.As this Government is supposed to be about job creation, how many jobs could be created with €1.25 billion?  If one takes the average industrial wage, one could create 35,000 jobs for one year with €1.25 billion.  There would be wealth generation, consumer spending, increased Government revenue and a reduction in social welfare payments.  This is the kind of opportunity that has been lost by not retaining that money in this economy.  As for the work that could be done, the €1.25 billion also could be used to deal with the ageing water mains infrastructure, thereby saving money and creating jobs.  It would provide enough money to construct offshore wind energy that could then be exported.  It could be used to retrofit homes, which again would create jobs and save money.  This would not be money going down the drain and would not be expenditure without return.  The money also could dramatically enhance the rail network or would allow the construction of two hospitals of the size of the proposed national children's hospital.  This is the kind of project that could be carried out with that kind of money.The promissory note, which is due to be paid on 31 March, is absolutely unsupportable.  Gene Kerrigan wrote an article recently in which he discussed who would pay this debt.  He noted the 60,000 children who were born in 2002 will be 21 in 2023 and will be paying the interest rate and residuals arising therefrom.  Similarly, the 74,000 children who were born last year will be paying it in 2031.  What is being done in respect of the promissory note has a consequence way beyond Ireland's reputation with the troika.  In this context, the Technical Group met representatives of the troika last week and I listened to their press conference, at which they stated they read the newspapers and that they pay attention to what people say.  They told us there had to be buy-in and that they thought there was buy-in to this programme in Ireland as, otherwise, they would see resistance.The point is that resistance in Greece brought a reduction in Ireland's interest rate.  Resistance paid off, while this passive slapping of people's backs will not deliver for Ireland.  It will not be a success if Ireland ends up getting a small interest rate reduction on these promissory notes.  There must be either an almost complete write-down on them or, as was suggested last night, or an extension of their terms to enable inflation to take care of the problem.  Two things are required to control people, namely, fear and insecurity and this is what the Government is dishing out in abundance.  It is making a population passive, which I believe to be highly dangerous in the longer term, because the people will boil over at some point.  Moreover, I believe they are not too far from so doing.

Having listened to the contributions and debate, the Minister for Finance is of the view that there is considerable common ground on all sides of the House.  All Members are agreed that every effort must be made to reduce the cost to the Exchequer of the promissory note.  They are also agreed, to various degrees, that the State should continue discussions with its international partners on how this can be achieved and, in general terms, that the State should not act unilaterally in this regard.There is a clear recognition that the situation with regard to the eurozone is evolving and that developments in this respect may provide opportunities for the State to revisit certain matters, including the cost to the State of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, arrangements that were entered into by the previous Government.  As an independent State, Ireland has taken the initiative to deal with its problems.  The Government has taken the hard decisions and will take whatever other decisions are necessary to get the country back on track as quickly as possible.  The Government must ensure, and our international partners must have regard to the need to ensure, that Ireland's capacity to repay its debts is maintained and enhanced.The Minister accepts the necessary adjustments in State expenditure have affected and will affect the level of services and the living standards of people.  The Minister accepts the impact of the adjustments must be fair and proportionate.  The Minister accepts it is galling to be obliged to pump State resources into supporting the financial sector.  These actions are, however, necessary as our economy will not operate without a banking system.  Moreover, we must get back to the financial markets for funding, we must re-establish our financial credibility and we must return to growth and prosperity for the good of our people.  We must do all these things in order to exit the programme of financial assistance from the EU-IMF at the earliest possible date to avoid this country being hamstrung for years or even decades by an enforced regime of austerity.  The Government is committed to delivering a return to a successful vibrant economy.  In this context, the Minister has indicated there is no private sector involvement for senior bank paper or Irish sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners.  This commitment has been agreed with our external partners and is now the basis on which Ireland's future financing strategy is built.There appears to be a suggestion that it may be possible simply to make the promissory note go away and that the Central Bank or the ECB would continue to fund the institution through the working out of the remaining loan book.  The Minister refers Deputies to the balance sheet of the bank.  In the first instance, the Central bank and the ECB are effectively funding the bank.  If the promissory note was removed from the balance sheet, there would be certain consequences, namely, the gap on the asset side of the balance sheet would still have to be filled; in the absence of this asset, the bank would fail, leading to insolvency and a requirement to repay all amounts due under all contracts; the Central Bank and the ECB could not continue to fund the bank under their own rules because the institution would no longer be a going concern or a licensed bank; the Central Bank-ECB funding of approximately €40 billion would have to be repaid and, as this is State backed, it would fall to the Government to repay it; and the assets of the bank would have to be disposed of in a fire sale, which would increase the losses to the taxpayer.  Is it realistic, in the current environment, to consider default as an option or to assume that the Central Bank or the ECB would continue to fund the bank in the circumstances I have outlined?As indicated, the Minister is committed to reviewing the approach to the promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State.  The troika has agreed to engage with Irish officials in a process to produce a common paper in which all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate, etc., would be considered.  In tandem with this technical review, the Government has commenced an intensive campaign at political level to garner support for an approach which would be more beneficial to the State.  The Minister met Commissioner Rehn and the President of the European Central Bank this week to progress the matter.The Government is committed to restoring sustainability to the public finances.  Clearly, this presents challenges for policymakers.  However, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to reduce the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015.  To this end, the Government has committed to increase the tax base and reduce expenditure as part of an overall budgetary strategy which is fair and measured.  It is essential, in conjunction with this approach, that productivity and efficiencies are achieved in the delivery of public services.The Minister thanks Deputies for this constructive and helpful debate and I ask them to support the Government's amendment.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1336	The Government thinks it is a good idea to pay €1.25 billion to unsecured bondholders.  It is of the view that it is not a good idea to upset the ECB or the financial markets.  However, it appears to be okay to upset people who depend on one-parent family payments, carer's allowance, the fuel allowance and the rent allowance and parents whose children are losing their guidance counsellors.  It also seems to be fine to cut the funding for DEIS schools and community employment schemes.  Those in government made one argument before the general election and a different one afterwards and they were unable to back up what they had said on both occasions.  They gave the impression prior to last year's general election that it would be a good idea not to give money to unsecured bondholders and the people believed them.On the household charge, in January last year Fine Gael stated:But the Government's proposal to introduce a steadily–rising, annual, recurring residential property tax on people's homes is unfair for two reasons ...• It will be difficult to pay for asset–rich but income poor households, particularly the elderly and the unemployed.• It will be deeply unfair for a young generation that paid exorbitant amounts of stamp duty and VAT on the purchases on over–valued houses, many of whom now find themselves in negative equity.There was one story before the election and a different one afterwards.  What does power do to people?At Question Time last week I referred to the continued use of Shannon Airport by American military aeroplanes on their way to Afghanistan.  In October 2007 the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, stated:The war is wrong and Ireland was wrong to support it through the use of Shannon Airport.  The war was wrong on grounds of international law, wrong on grounds of morality and wrong because it degenerated into an assault against the most basic principles of our common humanity.When I challenged him last week on the fact that the Government had done nothing in respect of the US military continuing to use Shannon Airport, he stated, "There are no plans to change the arrangements for the overflight and landing of US military aircraft, which have been continuously in place under successive Governments for over 50 years."  He thinks it is okay for military aeroplanes to land at Shannon Airport and then proceed to Afghanistan in order to drop bombs on people asleep in their beds in the middle of the night.The difference is standards is incredible.  Making one argument when in opposition and arguing the complete opposite when in power is so dishonest.  How, in God's name, can anyone expect politicians in this country to have credibility?  The people threw the previous Government out on its ear.  During the election campaign those opposite stated they would take a stand on various matters, but when they entered office, they did the exact opposite.  That is completely unfair to the people who voted for them.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1337	I wish to respond the Minister of State's comments.  His attempt to wrap those in opposition around him and state we were united in agreement on the bones of the motion was complete and utter nonsense.  He said: "They also are agreed, to various degrees, that the State should continue discussions with its international partners on how this can be achieved and in general terms that the State should not act unilaterally in this regard."  I reject this assertion.  The State should act unilaterally.  That is what we are seeking, particularly if it proves necessary and we are pushed in that direction.There is a gross misunderstanding among those on the Government benches of what is happening in respect of these and other bonds.  I accept that I sometimes speak from a different perspective from those on these benches who are opposed to the Government.  I do not know what those in government believe was in the minds of those who were buying bonds at 55 cent, 60 cent or 70 cent.  However, Deputy Catherine Murphy put her finger on it when she stated the people concerned thought they had won the lottery.  The market had clearly indicated that there was no one on God's Earth who would pay 100 cent on the bonds in question, unless, of course, they were mugs.  The only mugs who have emerged from this episode of market madness are those in the Government.  The Government has actually paid 100 cent on bonds which were purchased at 55 cent.Because I used to work in the financial world I am familiar with the individuals to whom I refer.  They would not have been too worried if the Government had not paid them back.  They did not expect to be paid back, which is why the market had priced the bonds in question at the level to which I refer.  Those who bought them cannot believe their luck.  The Government did not have to pay back the money for these bonds and it would not have suffered any great hit to its credibility if it had burned bondholders who had expected to be burned.What is the Government doing?  It is showing extraordinary deference to the ECB.  Like the gladiators in ancient Rome, it is saying to that institution, "Those who are about to die salute you."  It is showing deference to the ECB when it does not need to do so and the ECB is responding by kicking it in the teeth.When commenting on this issue this morning, the Taoiseach made two large mistakes.  The first, as Deputy Finian McGrath stated, relates to the fact that the Taoiseach continues to refer to the 1.3% growth rate on which the deal with the troika is based.  That is nonsense and the rate in question no longer applies.  On that basis, the Taoiseach is going to have difficulty in paying back the money to the troika.  The second error he made was when he stated we were not going to write off any of the debt and that we were not looking to do so.  The first thing we should be seeking to do is write off some of the debt on all counts.The Taoiseach was mealy-mouthed and uttered weasel words when he stated the Government was seeking to reduce the cost of the debt.  All that would involve is the lowering of interest rates and extending the period for repayment of the debt.  The first thing the Government should be seeking to do is not pay back the principal amount.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1338	I thank the United Left Alliance Deputies for tabling this motion and I thank the Deputies who supported it.There is no doubt in my mind that in the major financial centres of the world, from Wall Street to London and Paris and further afield, there have been celebratory lunches and champagne receptions today organised by the sharks of the financial markets who, courtesy of the Irish Government, have just pocketed €1.25 billion in funds belonging to the Irish people.  These are speculators who cannot believe their good fortune that the Irish people have now been put in a position of virtual financial serfdom by their own Government, at the diktat of the European Union and European Central Bank bureaucrats, in order to pay the toxic debts of the European financial system which recklessly lent to Anglo Irish Bank in pursuit of private profit in the crazed property market in this country.However, while the champagne is flowing freely in the financial capitals today, while the hedge fund gamblers are toasting the capitulation of a spineless Irish Government that has channelled these huge funds into their coffers, our education system is being shorn of its teachers and other crucial supports.  Children in disadvantaged areas are faced with a rowback of advances made in education over recent years.  Children in rural Ireland are losing teachers in their hundreds, and children in Gaeltacht schools are even more harshly treated.  All of this is for want of the very resources that are being transfused from our society into the bloated bellies of the major players of the European and world financial markets.  Likewise, our health service and elderly care is being stripped, layer by painful layer.Labour Party Deputies came to this debate with weasel words, denouncing the United Left Alliance and our motion.  What was their rationale for that?  It is that the Irish people should give €1.25 billion to the Anglo Irish Bank bondholders in order that we may impress those who wrongly dictated that this money should be paid in the first place, namely, the EU and the ECB, and in order that these masters would deign to allow some relief from the €47 billion in further funds from the same toxic bank that is supposed to be paid again by the Irish people over the next 20 years.  Labour Deputies justify throwing €1.25 billion into the snouts of these Anglo Irish Bank speculators, with outstretched hands to the bosses of the ECB and the EU to go easy in the matter of the promissory notes.  How far the Labour Party Deputies are from the founders of their party, Connolly and Larkin, and their approach to the financial markets of their day.The crazed casinos that are the financial markets today arise from a diseased system.  It is a capitalist system that is now in acute crisis.  Finance capital has become a bloated parasite over the last 30 years as it moves money from productive manufacturing investment into crazed speculation and starving production.  The crash and the crisis worldwide is the result.The answer to this is a financial system that is in public ownership and democratic control, directed towards the well-being of society.  Across Europe, hundreds of millions of ordinary people are the victims of this capitalist crisis.  The Labour Party is part of a Europe-wide network of parties that call themselves socialists and democrats.  Why do they not use that network to have a Europe-wide campaign in opposition to this crazed financial system that is lording it over the working people of Europe at the moment?  It is because the Labour Party Deputies have long since bought into the capitalist markets.  They have embraced financial capitalism and, therefore, they implement its law.  They are, therefore, pathetically inadequate in front of this crisis.  When we in the United Left Alliance say, "Don't pay" - I do not use the word "default" because they were never our debts to default on - our alternative is a financial system publicly owned and democratically controlled.The Irish people must intervene decisively to stop these crazed policies.  For three years they have endured this horrific austerity.  They voted massively a year ago for change.  They have been cheated in that regard.  They now have an opportunity.  New taxes have been put on top of them - the household tax and the septic tank tax - in order to continue this austerity and bailout.  They can now say, "No".  The Irish people can now organise a mass boycott of these taxes, which is what they should do and I believe they will do in their hundreds of thousands of households, which means millions of people.The Government has set 31 March------

That will then create a situation where this Government has to think.  We will hold the line with a massive and powerful campaign to force a change of policy, to stop the crazed bailouts and payments to the bondholders, to stop the crazed promissory note situation, to change the austerity policy and to bring about a policy of investment, job creation and reinstatement and reinstitution of our society.Deputy Stagg is wrong.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1352	The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) monitors business cost and competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland's position in these areas.  The NCC does not rank the top 5 barriers, it uses 127 indicators to benchmark competitiveness across a wide range of issues, including:Macroeconomic stabilityBusiness InvestmentExport PerformanceCost Competitiveness.While the NCC does not rank the challenges in order of priority, in its "Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard 2011" report, published in July, the Council listed the 6 priority challenges to be addressed as:Productivity and InnovationAccess to CreditLabour Market ActivationTaxation PolicyEducationInfrastructure.In their most recent publication, "Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2011", they have added Reducing the Cost of Doing Business, public sector reform and corporate governance.Clearly the steps needed to meet these challenges require a whole of Government approach.  Through actions already taken in the Jobs Initiative and the recent Budget, we have taken steps to address many of the issues.  The NCC has acknowledged that a series of measures have already been taken to remove structural barriers to growth, on reducing costs, up-skilling and re-skilling, investing in infrastructure, reducing the budget deficit, improving access to finance for enterprise and public sector reform.Minister Bruton is currently working with Government colleagues to finalise the "Action Plan for Jobs", which will include a number of actions across these priority areas designed to bring about further improvements in Ireland's competitiveness.  Final proposals are still under consideration by Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1353	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 28 together.As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am acutely aware of the number of jobs lost in recent years in every region of the country and I fully appreciate the impact of these job losses, not just on the employees concerned and their families, but also on the wider community.  Therefore, job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  Our objective is to put the country back on the road to economic recovery and full employment.While in the past, Task Forces have been used as part of the response to particular regional job loss crises, in more recent years the concept of an Interagency Response Group has been advanced.  This type of initiative worked well in relation to a particular job loss situation in the border region recently where representatives of relevant agencies such as EI, IDA, FÁS and the County Enterprise Board came together to provide a comprehensive suite of supports to those affected by job loss.Last month, in recognition of the particular impact of the economic downturn on the South East Region, I published the South East Employment Action Plan, a key part of which was that a clear priority would be assigned to the region by the State enterprise agencies under the remit of my Department.  While the region's problems will not be addressed overnight, my plan to bring employment to the South East is a recognition that the structural challenges in the region can only be addressed through a concerted process over several years involving Government, political, community, and other stakeholders in the region.Other national efforts such as the Jobs Initiative, announced on 10 May 2011, concentrated on the measures that offered the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy, particularly tourism which offers real opportunities in the Border and South East regions. Promoting regional balance is an important objective for our enterprise agencies. IDA has a target of securing 50% of all its investments in locations outside of Dublin and Cork. Research clusters which back up sectoral opportunities are spread widely across the country and seek to develop a competitive advantage in different regions and the County Enterprise Board structure is designed to support enterprise in each county.In relation to the work of the enterprise development agencies, approximately 62% of Enterprise Ireland client companies are located outside Dublin.  These companies employ around 137,000 people of which 67% are located in the regions.  Of the 79 investments announced by the IDA in 2011, 37 were located in the Regions outside of Dublin and Cork.  These announcements alone have the potential to create more than 3,000 jobs.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1354	The Deputy is referring to the targeted Temporary, Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme which is currently being progressed as a matter of priority by my Department. An Invitation to Tender was published on Monday 5th  December to select on Operator who will be contracted by my Department to act as its agent for the practical oversight, management and operation of the Scheme. The tendering process for the selection of an Operator is nearing completion.  Primary legislation is required to make the necessary statutory provision for such a scheme.  Formal drafting of the Bill is being progressed urgently with the office of Parliamentary Counsel.  The Bill will be published within the Spring session.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1355	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 27 together.The Pharmaceutical and ICT sectors make a very significant contribution to the Irish economy in terms of export earnings and employment.  The Medical, Pharmaceutical and Chemical sectors accounted for €46 billion, or 51%, of total Merchandise exports in 2010.  Computer components and electronics accounted for €8 billion of Merchandise exports, while computer services accounted for €28.2 billion, or 38%, of all Services exports in 2010.  Between them, the two sectors employ over 110,000 people in Ireland.  These sectors will therefore continue to play an important role in the Irish economy.However, building a strong enterprise mix can ensure that Ireland is not overly reliant on a limited number of sectors for future growth.  We must also seek to capture the opportunities afforded by the growth of emerging sectors, with a view to maximising the employment potential they offer.  Ireland cannot be leader in every sector. But there are many sectors where we can create and sustain a competitive edge.  Sectors which have been identified as holding particular potential for Ireland include Agri-food, Health and Life sciences, Digital Games, the Green Economy, International Education and International Financial Services.Within the Chemicals and ICT sectors, new sub-sectors are also emerging which afford employment opportunities for Ireland, including in "Silver technologies", nutraceuticals and Cloud Computing.  The Government is also committed to supporting more mature sectors such as Tourism and Manufacturing to avail of new opportunities and improve their product offering.Ireland has established a strong platform in Financial Services, Medical Devices and Food to mention some areas, and achieved strong growth in these sectors in recent years. Our agencies are constantly assessing emerging sectoral opportunities that offer a good fit for Ireland. A Research Prioritisation exercise has been undertaken to identify how research spending should be channelled to maximise opportunities.  The Government will shortly be publishing its 2012 Action Plan for Jobs which will set out a series of clear actionable measures across Government to support the creation and retention of jobs in the sectors outlined above.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1356	The role of Government is to create the conditions where enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish and quality employment opportunities can be grown and maintained, and all of the actions that we have taken since coming into office have focused on creating these conditions across all regions.  The sustainability of our regions will be significantly shaped by interaction with the international economy — in terms of investment, tourism and the growth of indigenous businesses. Changing the over-reliance on construction and other boom-time sectors of unsustainable growth for employment, is a key focus of Government,  and I will shortly be bringing forward an Action Plan for Jobs 2012 which has this objective as a priority.Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with the relevant County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support enterprise development in the regions in question.  One of the high level goals of IDA's strategy "Horizon 2020” is that in the period to end 2014, 50% of new FDI projects will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  Of the 79 investments announced in 2011, 37 have met have met this criteria.  These announcements alone have the potential to create more than 3,000 jobs.  At present, there are a total of 120 IDA supported companies employing over 17,500 people between both regions.Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of programmes to address the multi-disciplinary demands of entrepreneurship and the diversity of business types. Between the two regions, the agency has almost 700 clients employing over 17,500 people.  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland-assisted companies created 457 new full-time jobs in the Midlands region and 1,144 in the West.  In addition, over €6.7m was approved for the agency's client companies in the West regions.In 2010, the County and City Enterprise Boards in the Midlands and Western Regions paid out over €2.3m in grant assistance to 207 clients.  The CEBs will continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development and engage and work with microenterprise businesses on an ongoing basis with strong referral to sister agencies to progress the needs of the businesses in their respective areas.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14294	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1357	My Department, through the work of the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offers a range of supports to assist and enable Irish entrepreneurs and enterprises to engage in the optimal exploitation of innovation, research and development and to apply for patents.  The Patents Office provides information supports to applicants through the Office's website www.patentsoffice.ie   regarding patenting procedures in Ireland and abroad. The Patents Office also provides an Intellectual Property (IP) clinic service providing members of the public, inventors, entrepreneurs and business people an opportunity to discuss on a one to one basis with Patents Office staff their ideas and matters concerning IP.Since April 2010, the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland, the Enterprise Europe Network and County Enterprise Boards have partnered to present a series of one day free seminars at a range of regional locations under the working title of "Building a Business on your Ideas".  Support nationally and locally for micro enterprises, small businesses and new start ups is provided through the wide range of assistance offered by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland.   Both the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland tailored programmes and supports in the form of grants, business advice, training and mentoring elements of which are directed at ensuring that innovative technologies and intellectual property are secured and protected.EI has strengthened the resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property and have recently appointed (January 2012)  an Intellectual Property Manager,  whose role is to act as the central point in EI for enquiries and advice on IP matters as a strategic tool in business development.  In addition, EI's Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme drives the national effort in transferring IP from the research base in the HEIs and Research Institutes in Ireland into industry, while the Technology Partnering Programme aims at partnering Irish client companies with multi-national corporations with a view to facilitating access to and promotion of significant technologies via licensing of IP and technology spin-outs.  EI also provides funding support for innovative High Potential Start-Ups under which assistance is provided towards the patent costs of the company to protect its in-house intellectual property.  Under the EI R&D Fund patent costs are an eligible expenditure item which can be included in the support offered.While it is first and foremost a matter for owners of IP to decide on the best way to protect IP rights, those owners can be confident that the Government is committed to ensuring Irish IP legislation reflects best practice in IP protection systems in Europe and elsewhere.  Indeed, the Government has been making a sustained effort over recent years to ensure that patent, trademark, industrial design and copyright laws, among other IP areas, are kept as up to date as possible. This work arises primarily in the context of EU and other international obligations.In the area of patents, my Department continues to make it easier for enterprises to patent their innovations. The Patents Amendment Bill 2011, currently in the Seanad, will enable Ireland to implement the London Agreement with the effect of lowering the current high level of translation costs for patent applicants. At EU level, Ireland is actively participating in the enhanced cooperation process for a unitary patent that will further reduce costs for Irish innovators wishing to obtain patent protection across Europe.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1358	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 26 together.Inspectors of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), following complaints, called to all of the Jane Norman stores and concessions operating within the State in an effort to establish the position on the ground. The NERA Information service gave information to the employees on their entitlements and on the practical business of the submission of the various claims for monies owed to them.The Jane Norman closure did indeed have similarities with the recent closure of the La Senza group in that both retail groups closed suddenly without notice to the employees, both were placed into Administration in the UK and both communicated poorly with their staff at the outset. A settlement was however subsequently reached at La Senza following talks by both sides.  In both cases better communications and the following of established procedures by the employer side would have permitted an orderly closure whereby all employees would have been aware of their entitlements and the uncertainty as to whether and when they would be paid would have been avoided.Although this is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, my understanding is that in cases of insolvency, unpaid wages due to workers prior to it being placed in administration can be paid directly by that Department from the Social Insurance Fund up to a maximum of 8 weeks pay and within a pay ceiling of €600 per week.  Any such claims should be submitted by employees to the administrator of the group who will certify and forward them to the insolvency payments section in the Department of Social Protection.  I am not in position to advise on the status of any particular claims or progress in relation to their processing as these are matters for the Minister for Social Protection.Unpaid wages that were incurred after the group entered administration do not come within the protection of insolvency legislation and accordingly could not be reimbursed from the insolvency fund. These outstanding entitlements can be pursued through the Rights Commissioners Service. Any decision in favour of an employee issuing from such proceedings may be enforced (against the administrator) as though it were a civil order made by a judge of the Circuit Court. The Single Complaint Form downloadable from the Workplace Relations website (workplacerelations.ie) should be used. I understand that a number of such claims are currently being pursued under various provisions of Employment legislation before the Rights Commissioners Service in respect of the companies at issue.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1359	Responsibility for the operation of the statutory Redundancy Payments Scheme falls within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection and the legislation governing that scheme does not fall within my Department's purview.  I understand that in accordance with the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007 employees who have two years continuous service with an employer, are aged 16 years or over, and are in employment, which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, are entitled to statutory redundancy payment from the employer in the event of being made redundant.Where employment has been terminated, the employees have an entitlement to redundancy, and where the employer fails to pay the employee's statutory entitlement, a claim may be referred by the employee to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).  On receipt of a favourable determination by the EAT the employee should submit the determination along with a completed RP50 form to the Redundancy Payments Section of the Department of Social Protection for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.In a case where the employer cannot afford to pay an employee their entitlement, an employer and employee can apply to the Social Insurance Fund for a Redundancy Lump sum using form RP50. Proof of inability to pay is required together with an acknowledgement of the employer's liability for 85% (from 1 January 2012) of the statutory redundancy payment. The Minister for Social Protection will make the payment from the Social Insurance Fund and subsequently seek to recover repayment of 85% of the statutory redundancy payment.Redundancy payment entitlement is two weeks wages for each year of service with a bonus week added on subject to a maximum ceiling on gross wage. The current ceiling on the weekly wage used for calculation purposes is €600.  Where a company is forced to close, monies owing to workers (including redundancy) have a preferential status in the distribution of assets.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1360	Over many years, Ireland's pharmaceutical strategy has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breath of operations over multiproduct sites including associated services and development of new compounds.  Ireland has been enormously successful in attracting eight of the global major players and the world's number one biotechnology company to Ireland. In addition, Ireland has a large number of companies outside of the top ten who manufacture and successfully export from Ireland. IDA Ireland has focused on biopharmaceuticals which represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry and it has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, and Pfizer as examples. Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of Pharmaceutical products.In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to attract leading investment in the pharmaceutical industry and, in the last 2 years, has attracted manufacturing companies of the quality of Warner Chilcott, Biomarin, Alkermes, Sangart and one of the world's leading generic manufacturers, Mylan. This is in addition to major on-going investment by existing companies.From across its existing companies, IDA Ireland continues to win large scale investments in product development and capability building to take on new product mandates. Ireland already has successful generic manufacturers such as Clonmel Healthcare, Ranbaxy, Wockhardt, Teva and Rowa. These companies have operated successfully from Ireland competing with low cost competition for many years.  IDA Ireland has assured me that it continues to operate an extensive programme of business and site transformation, working with all its manufacturing sites and Pharma Chemical Ireland, the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing arm of IBEC.I am aware that a series of major patents will expire in the coming year and that patent expiry can result in reduced selling prices for pharmaceutical companies. However, manufacturing location decisions are rarely made on a single product basis and companies also consider factors such as quality, safety, competence, costs and tax.  In addition, transferring production lines from one pharmaceutical site to another is a complex undertaking and cannot be done easily.   Multinational companies practice optimal site loading to ensure high efficiency and productivity within a global plant network.Whether available as a generic or a brand, global companies strive to ensure that the products they produce are produced to the highest international standards.  Ireland retains an exemplary global record in this regard with an excellent regulator in the Irish Medicines Board and with much improved competitiveness through wage reduction and restraint which is helping Ireland to compete with lower cost locations.The overall export performance of the sector, therefore, is multifactorial and whilst there are challenges with regard to patent expiration, IDA Ireland is succeeding in renewing its patent protected volumes through winning new product mandates in small and large molecule manufacture.  The future export performance of the BioPharma industry will be a reflection of all of these drivers of activity and the flexibility of the Irish operating environment to support continuous improvement and transformation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1361	Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  Our objective is to put the country back on the road to economic recovery and full employment.  The achievement of balanced regional growth is a core objective of Government.  Promoting entrepreneurship and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entrepreneurial activity.This objective is consistent with the EU Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines, which govern the areas in which the enterprise and industrial development agencies in Member States may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid.  Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  The Guidelines specify rules for the selection of regions that are eligible for regional aid and define the maximum permitted levels of this aid.  Under Ireland's current Regional Aid Map, regions covering 50% of the population are entitled to Regional Aid grants.  The details of the support in terms of aid intensity for each county are available on my Departments website, and are also listed in the chart at the end of this answer.Funding was secured by Ireland from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for a package of measures to re-train, up-skill and offer further entrepreneurial and educational opportunities to workers affected by the closures of Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics. While the bulk of the EGF funding was delivered in the retraining and up-skilling area (generally via FAS) the enterprise support strands of the Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics EGFs were, in the main, delivered through the County and City Enterprise Boards in the regions affected by the closures of those companies.  Almost 500 people availed of such supports.On a national basis, both the Jobs Initiative, announced last May, and Budget 2012 in December, set out measures that aim to return this country to growth, pay down our debt and focus our efforts on policies that facilitate job retention and expansion, as well as addressing unemployment.  The enterprise development agencies which come under the aegis of my Department are also active across the regions.  Currently, approximately 62% of Enterprise Ireland client companies are located outside Dublin.  These companies employ around 137,000 people of which 67% are located in the regions.  Of the 79 investments announced by the IDA in 2011, 37 were located outside of Dublin and Cork.  These announcements alone have the potential to create more than 3,000 jobs.The County and City Enterprise Boards have continued to support enterprise development across all the regions.  The latest figures available indicate that almost 33,000 people are employed in companies supported by the County and City Enterprise Boards throughout the country.  Currently work on the Government's Action Plan for Jobs is nearing completion.  This Plan, that I am taking the lead on, will set out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs.Border, Midlands and West RegionLarge FirmsMedium FirmsSmall FirmsPeriod2007-20102011-20132007-20102011-’132007- ’102011-’13Aid Rate (Gross Grant Equivalent)30%15%40%25%50%35%Designated AreasLarge FirmsMedium firmsSmall FirmsSouth East sub-region (Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, South Tipperary) and designated islands1

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1362	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 107 together.Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. The Government's Jobs Initiative, which was announced last May, was aimed at building confidence to encourage consumers to spend, providing opportunities for re-skilling for those who have lost their jobs and helping to get people back to work.  It is a cross-Government initiative and the impacts are being seen across a range of sectors.It is not possible to indicate the exact number of positions which have been filled as a result of the measures which were taken in the Jobs Initiative, as there are indirect as well as direct impacts arising from the Initiative.  However, I do have some data in relation to some of the measures we have taken.  The Jobs Initiative introduced a 9% VAT rate from 1st July on a range of services, including hotels and restaurants. The Government also halved employer's PRSI for those on modest wages.  These measures are of considerable benefit to tourism and hospitality businesses, lowering their cost base, and allowing them to offer a more competitive product to overseas tourists and domestic consumers.These measures were credited by the Restaurant Association of Ireland for the creation of 490 new jobs in that sector within the first two months of the implementation of the Jobs Initiative.  These measures have also helped in making Irish hotels rooms the cheapest in Europe at present, which has been a factor in boosting Irish tourism numbers.  The Jobs Initiative targeted Capital spending at labour-intensive local projects, focussing on school works, local roads, energy efficiency and smarter travel projects.  Work undertaken between May and October on sustainable travel projects has created over 14,000 days of employment for local contractors around the country.The level of take-up and activity under the domestic retrofitting schemes to date is demonstrably supporting employment, given the labour intensive nature of energy efficiency upgrades.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advised that over 5,800 full time jobs were supported in 2011.  This represents an increase of some 2,000 jobs last year over the 3,800 jobs already being supported under the Schemes.Overseas tourist numbers for the first eleven months of 2011 are up 6.8% on the same period in 2010.  The number of visitors from mainland Europe were up 8.5% and visitors from North America were up 5.6%, while trips abroad by Irish residents were down by 4%, which suggests higher domestic tourism.  The latest trade figures show that, in the first nine months of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010, Irish exports increased by 4% to €69,425m.  The increased activity in both of these sectors is expected to lead to additional jobs.Building on the Jobs Initiative, I am currently preparing an Action Plan for Jobs for Government.  This will be launched in the coming weeks and will set out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1364	As stated previously, my priority is that any decision taken by Bank of America will have minimal impact on employees at the Carrick on Shannon operation and ensure that jobs are maintained at the facility. The process regarding the sale of Bank of America's Irish and UK credit card businesses is ongoing.  There is considerable interest in both the MBNA Ireland portfolio and the MBNA UK portfolio, which will almost certainly be sold separately. Negotiations regarding the sale of the MBNA Ireland portfolio have continued to advance in recent weeks.IDA has met the relevant parties, is monitoring the situation closely and is providing relevant input into the process as it is moves forward.  IDA is in regular contact with local Bank of America management in Carrick on Shannon and Dublin and at corporate level to monitor developments.Separate to the above, IDA has been and continues to market Carrick on Shannon and the Bank of America MBNA capability there to other potential investors, should the above negotiations fail to lead to a positive outcome result.  This has included creating a detailed profile/factfile in conjunction with Bank of America MBNA management to highlight the skillset, experience and facility in Carrick on Shannon.  This profile is being used by IDA's international network of offices to market both the centre itself and the location.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1366	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 100 together.Policy responsibility for upward-only rent reviews comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  I do not have specific data on the impact of upward-only rent agreements but the National Competitiveness Council provides some data on rents generally.  Rent represents an average of 2% to 7% of total costs for manufacturing businesses, and 5% to 6% of total costs for services businesses.The Council reported in its Competitiveness Scorecard 2011 that Ireland experienced a fall of 22% in rental costs for prime industrial sites in 2010, with a decline of 12.3% in prime office space rental costs.  Both of these were the largest annual declines experienced across the countries benchmarked and both marked a continuation of falling prices seen since the peak in 2007.  Rental costs in many of Ireland's competitor economies rose in 2010.  Nonetheless, upward-only rent reviews have kept rents for some businesses at an artificially high level compared to open market trends and property values.The Land Conveyancing and Law Reform Act 2009 abolished upward-only rent reviews for all new leases signed on or after 28 February 2010.  However, upward-only rent review clauses continue to apply to leases which were entered into prior to that date.  Following legal advice, the Government has decided that it is not feasible to proceed with legislation to abolish upward only rent review clauses in existing business leases.  However, businesses can make use of the rent review arbitration code, which provides a mechanism to deal with disputes on commercial rents and can help to resolve issues at a lower cost, in considerably less time, and in a less adversarial way for the parties concerned.NAMA also has a policy guidance for dealing with tenants' difficulties arising from upward-only rent reviews.  This provides an opportunity for NAMA to approve rent reductions where it can be shown that rents are in excess of current market levels and a tenant's viability is threatened.  The policy also provides for the appointment of an independent valuation of market rent where necessary.  NAMA has advised the Minister for Finance that where a tenant is not getting satisfaction in the negotiations with his NAMA landlord, the tenant can contact NAMA directly.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1367	Multi National Enterprises are a very significant component of the Irish enterprise sector and will continue to play an important role in our economy.  IDA Multi National client companies support over 146,000 direct jobs and spend €19 billion in the Irish economy each year.  The environment for Foreign Direct Investment remains robust and has created core strengths in key sectors.However, an indigenous engine of export growth is also an essential ingredient for economic recovery.  We must now create the environment where Irish companies can consistently build market share, where more companies start to export for the first time, where clusters of competitive advantage develop, and Irish-owned and foreign-owned companies work more closely together to forge new areas of opportunity.Although exports from the indigenous sector have increased over recent years, the overall contribution from the sector needs to be further enhanced.  Our goal for increasing exports is to support enterprises to achieve challenging targets by building their share in key markets and to increase the proportion of output exported by indigenous companies.  Indigenous companies are also finding opportunities in emerging sectors which have been identified as holding particular potential for Ireland.  These include sectors such as Health and Life sciences, Cloud Computing, Digital and Media Services, Digital Gaming, and the Green Economy.The Government will shortly be publishing its 2012 Action Plan for Jobs which will set out a series of clear actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs.  The Action Plan will include specific measures to support indigenous start-ups and help indigenous business to grow.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1368	Support for micro-enterprises, small businesses and new start-ups is provided by my Department through the wide range of assistance offered by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland.  The role of the CEBs is to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.Subject to certain eligibility criteria, CEBs can provide direct financial assistance to a project promoter in the form of Priming, Expansion/Development Grants and Feasibility/Innovation Grants. The CEBs also provide a range of indirect non-financial assistance such as business advice, mentoring, management capability training and development programmes.  In addition, in order to promote increased levels of entrepreneurship activity amongst young people and females, the CEBs operate a Student Enterprise Award Scheme and numerous Women-in-Business Networks.  Potential entrepreneurs of all age profiles are encouraged to contact their appropriate CEB through their national website address, www.enterpriseboards.ie, to discuss what options may be available to them and their potential business.Beyond the microenterprise sector, Enterprise Ireland operates a range of measures that provide participants with the business skills, contacts, mentoring and support to potentially transform their innovative ideas or technologies into exporting businesses.  Under the auspices of Enterprise Ireland, the Government has also invested significantly in the broader environment for business start-ups, including investment in incubators, seed and venture funds, angel networks and mentors.Over 90% of EI's company clients are SMEs. EI works with companies to strengthen their business plans, build their leadership and management capability, connect them for opportunities with overseas buyers and researchers, and provide them with access to finance.  In addition to the Agency supports outlined the Government is developing a temporary targeted partial credit guarantee scheme and a Microfinance fund, both of which will be designed to help viable businesses at start-up and expansion stages.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1369	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 36 and 46 together.During 2011, I attended the Trade and Business North South Ministerial Council, which I chaired, and two meetings of the North South Plenary between the Taoiseach and First and Deputy First Ministers.  The Ministers of State at my Department and I also attended a number of North South conferences and events during the course of 2011.  On 1st March next, I will attend the next meeting of the Trade and Business Development North South Ministerial Council.  Inter Trade  Ireland was established under the Good Friday Agreement to “exchange information and co-ordinate work on trade, business development and related matters in areas where the two administrations specifically agree it would be in their mutual interest”.Enterprise policy co-ordination and practical all-island business co-operation in the areas of Trade, Innovation and Business and Economic Research are already a reality through InterTradeIreland's work, which is underpinned by joint funding from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.  North South economic co-operation is and will remain a priority for myself and the Government. This is evidenced by the fact that despite the enormous pressures on our budgets, I have secured an allocation for 2012 for InterTradeIreland which will be maintained at 2011 levels.The enterprise development agencies North and South of the border have for many years co-operated where this has added value to their activities, and this collaboration has greatly increased in recent years. Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes.  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the Northwest Now initiative. More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.My Department also provides funding support for Interreg projects, which are supported by the EU and the Northern Ireland Executive.  Through Interreg, we have supported a number of North South enterprise projects, including enterprise networking for the border counties and Northern Ireland, for example, for renewable energy and sustainable development.  I understand that a number of other network projects are currently under consideration by the Interreg Managing Authority, the Special EU Programmes Body.  The Government, along with the enterprise development agencies, will work diligently with the Northern Ireland Executive and its agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-border co-operation and the work of the North South Bodies.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1370	The Campus Incubation Centre Programme is delivered by Enterprise Ireland and supports the development of projects at the micro-enterprise stage.  Over the last 15 years, funding of approximately €55 million has been provided through the Enterprise Ireland programme for the establishment of business incubation centres on higher education campuses throughout Ireland.  The programme has fostered the development and expansion of small companies on campus, has supported the commercialisation of research carried out in the third level sector, and has made a contribution to more balanced regional development.A total of 22 facilities are now operational in the campuses of Universities and Institutes of Technology and about 300 new companies are currently in Incubation Units employing over 1,300 people.  These start-up enterprises are operating in a wide range of sectors, including digital media, environmental technologies and medical devices.  The provision of a new Incubation Centre at NUI Maynooth is about to get underway and it is anticipated that this investment will be completed over the next two years.With the establishment phase of the programme, which has involved significant infrastructural investment, now largely completed, the priority moves to ensuring that a maximisation of economic activity, in terms of business and job creation potential, will come through the Incubation Centres. The emphasis will be sweating the assets created by the investment, in terms of economic output, and of ensuring that there is coherence between these facilities and the delivery of two allied programmes, the Business Partners Programme and the Enterprise Platform Programme.  Enterprise Ireland will promote its Business Partners Initiative to drive the commercialisation of emerging research in Universities by way of start-up firms and also, in collaboration with the Institutes of Technology, Enterprise Ireland will shortly be rolling out a significantly revised Enterprise Platform Programme, which is an intensive entrepreneurship development programme.Funding of just over €1 million was provided from this Department's Vote through Enterprise Ireland for this incubation programme in 2011 and it is projected that €2m will be provided in 2012.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1371	The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reform public procurement so that it supports innovative firms and allows greater access to public procurement by SMEs.  The Jobs Initiative of last May also reinforced the Government's commitment to promote greater access to procurement opportunities for SMEs, including through identifying and overcoming barriers to their participation in the procurement process.As the Deputy may be aware from previous replies given in the House, I established a Steering Group on SME Access to Public Procurement last July to identify clear and decisive measures which can be taken to improve SME access to public procurement.  The Steering Group was informed by work carried out by the High Level Group on Business Regulation on barriers to SME access to procurement, and by the Small Business Advisory Group, both of which are chaired by the Minister for Small Business, Deputy John Perry, TD.The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs which I am currently finalising for Government approval will include a series of actions designed to improve access to procurement for SMEs.  Practical measures will include the strengthening of Enterprise Ireland's engagement between SMEs and procuring authorities, the identification of key projects where close collaboration and sub-contracting between "Tier 1" principal contractors and pre-qualified "Tier 2" SMEs could be developed, and a new initiative to encourage contracting authorities to consider more innovative solutions to their procurement needs.Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, met with the Minister of State for Public Service Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes TD, who has responsibility for public procurement policy, to discuss the dual aims of ensuring a level playing field to allow SMEs to compete for public contracts, while also ensuring best value for money for the Exchequer in the procurement process.  Both Ministers pledged their continued support to the attainment of these objectives and to continuing to encourage SME participation in the public procurement process.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1372	The cost base of doing business is one of the key issues which determines Ireland's national and international competitiveness.  Through actions already taken in the Jobs Initiative and the recent Budget, the Government has taken steps to address many of the competitiveness challenges facing the Irish economy, including reducing costs, improving access to finance for enterprise and reforming the public sector.Banking policy falls within the remit of the Minister for Finance.  The decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on the interest rates they charge to customers are commercial decisions for the institutions concerned.  Interest rates are determined by a broad range of factors including ECB base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, and an institution's overall funding.  Neither I, nor the Minister for Finance, have any statutory function in relation to business interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time.As the Minister for Finance has indicated previously in the House, it is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  I am also working on other measures to improve access to credit for viable businesses, particularly SMEs.  A targeted Temporary, Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is currently being progressed as a matter of priority by my Department.  Work is nearing completion in relation to selecting an Operator to act as agent for my Department for the practical oversight, management and operation of the scheme, while drafting of the Bill necessary to implement the scheme is being progressed urgently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.In November 2011, the Government also sanctioned the establishment of a Micro-Finance Loan Fund to generate up to €100 million in additional micro-enterprise lending which will benefit over 5,000 businesses over a ten year period.  It is intended to establish the Micro-Finance Loan Fund facility in the first quarter of 2012.  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Microfinance Loan Fund will not solve all the issues around access to credit but they will form key components in the suite of initiatives aimed at ensuring the flow of credit to SMEs to sustain employment and create new jobs.Policy responsibility for upward-only rent reviews comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  The Land Conveyancing and Law Reform Act 2009 abolished upward-only rent reviews for all new leases signed on or after 28 February 2010.  However, upward-only rent review clauses continue to apply to leases which were entered into prior to that date.  Following legal advice, the Government has decided that it is not feasible to proceed with legislation to abolish upward only rent review clauses in existing business leases.  However, businesses can make use of the rent review arbitration code, which provides a mechanism to deal with disputes on commercial rents and can help to resolve issues at a lower cost, in considerably less time, and in a less adversarial way for the parties concerned.NAMA also has a policy guidance for dealing with tenants' difficulties arising from upward-only rent reviews.  This provides an opportunity for NAMA to approve rent reductions where it can be shown that rents are in excess of current market levels and a tenant's viability is threatened.  The policy also provides for the appointment of an independent valuation of market rent where necessary.  NAMA has advised the Minister for Finance that where a tenant is not getting satisfaction in the negotiations with his NAMA landlord, the tenant can contact NAMA directly.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1373	While I am informed that the company in question is not an enterprise development agency assisted company, I am most concerned to hear about these potential job losses in Navan.  I fully appreciate the impact that job losses have on the employees concerned and their families, but also on the wider community.This Government is fully committed to its role of facilitating employment creation.  Since coming into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  Our objective is to put the country back on the road to economic recovery and full employment.  Both the Jobs Initiative, announced last May and Budget 2012 set out in December each set out measures that aim to return this country to growth, pay down our debt and focus our efforts on policies that facilitate job retention and expansion, as well as addressing unemployment.Currently work on the Government's Action Plan for Jobs is nearing completion.  This Plan, which I am taking the lead on, will set out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs.In relation to the town of concern to the Deputy, the Enterprise Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with Meath County Enterprise Board are committed to supporting enterprise development in the area and County Meath generally.  I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, together with the policies and initiatives being pursued by the State Development agencies and the Meath County Enterprise Board will continue to bring about employment and investment opportunities for Navan and County Meath generally.

Anyone interested in these supports should consult the agency's website at www.enterprise-ireland.com.The CEBs provide both financial and non-financial assistance to business start-ups in the micro-enterprise sector. Subject to eligibility criteria such assistance is available to any person interested in starting their own business whether they are currently unemployed or not.  Anyone interested in setting up their own business should seek advice from their local CEB and in this regard should consult the website www.enterpriseboards.ie   where they will be directed to their most appropriate Enterprise Board.In addition, for more general information on developing a business in Ireland you may wish to contact the BASIS (Business Access to State Information and Services) Initiative, which is administered by my Department. The aim of the BASIS website, at www.basis.ie, is to deliver Government information and services to business.Labour activation measures specifically targeted at the long term unemployed are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  That Department operates a number of schemes which are aimed increasing the rate of business start-up and entrepreneurship among the long-term unemployed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1375	As part of the Forfás Annual Employment Survey, the overall cost per job is calculated each year by reference to the cost of jobs created during, and sustained at the end of, a seven-year period. The accepted accounting measure for cost per job is ‘Cost per job Sustained'.The cost per job sustained by the development agencies Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development for the period 2004/2010, calculated by taking into account each agency's expenditure to firms in the period of calculation, are €12,254, €14,287 and €7,552 respectively. In the case of each Agency, only jobs created during, and sustained at the end of, each seven year period are credited in the calculations.  These figures are published in the Agencies' Annual Reports 2010 which are available on their respective websites.I am informed that information relating to the period 2005/2011 for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development will be included in each Agency's respective Annual Report 2011, which will be published later this year.A different system is used by the City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) to calculate cost per job data. In the case of the CEBs the cost per job supported is €5,756. This is calculated on the basis of the 38,672 gross jobs created or sustained in the 10,920 enterprises which received assistance amounting to over €222 million from 1993 (their year of establishment) to 2010 (the most recent year for which figures are currently available).The significant contribution of the companies assisted by the enterprise development agencies to the Irish economy should be noted.  Indeed, according to the latest available figures in Forfás' Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact 2009, agency assisted companies were responsible for direct expenditure of €38bn in the domestic economy, delivering a significant economic impact nationwide.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1376	As the Deputy will be aware, the role of Government is not to create jobs directly, but to create the appropriate business environment by making the right policy decisions to help enterprise to grow, to create new jobs and maintain existing jobs.Since I came into office, I have been working with my Government colleagues to achieve these objectives.  We launched a Jobs Initiative last May, within two months of the Government coming into office, to stimulate domestic demand and restore confidence in the economy internationally.  The Jobs Initiative included an extra 20,900 places in training, education and upskilling for those who have lost their jobs, with a particular emphasis on those sectors which have experienced structural unemployment.It is unlikely that employment levels in certain sectors such as construction will return to pre-recession levels.  We must, in any event, ensure that Ireland is not overly reliant on a limited number of sectors for future growth.  Therefore, it is important that we build a strong enterprise mix and encourage employment growth across a range of sectors.Key areas which I have been working on to support job creation by enterprise across all sectors include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance and supporting innovation.  I have also been coordinating the preparation of the first annual Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, which will outline the measures to be taken across a range of sectors to support job creation in 2012.The Government will also shortly publish a policy statement on labour market activation, "Pathways to Work", which will set out further strategies to support those who are unemployed to re-enter the workforce.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1377	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 102 to 104, inclusive, together.I am currently finalising an Action Plan for Jobs for Government approval which will set out a series of clear actionable measures across Government to support the creation and retention of jobs in a range of sectors.In preparing the Action Plan, I have consulted with my Ministerial colleagues and with a wide range of stakeholders from the public, private and community sectors, to obtain their views on actions to support employment creation. I received over 600 individual ideas through this process.  Some of these ideas can be actioned in the short-term and will feature in the Action Plan for Jobs for 2012.  Other proposals can be delivered in a longer timeframe, or require further consideration.  These will be examined further over the coming months.To support economic recovery, it is important that we build a strong enterprise mix to ensure that Ireland is not overly reliant on a limited number of sectors for future growth.  We must also seek to capture the opportunities afforded by the growth of emerging sectors, with a view to maximising the employment potential they offer.Sectors which have been identified as holding particular potential for Ireland include Agri-food, Health and Lifesciences, Digital Games, Cloud Computing, the Green Economy, International Education and International Financial Services. The Government is also committed to supporting more mature sectors such as Tourism and Manufacturing to avail of new opportunities and improve their product offering.As well as setting out measures to support the growth of these sectors, the Action Plan for Jobs will seek to address key factors which can act as obstacles to job creation and retention.  These include issues such as costs of doing business, access to finance, administrative burdens on business, the need to improve company capability and access to new markets.The Action Plan will be published in the coming weeks, following its approval by Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1378	My Department, and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear focus on the development and support of manufacturing and services firms in Ireland. In order that enterprises can be successful and thrive and grow, they must be efficient, competitive and innovative.   In this regard, realizing the potential to increase efficiency and improve competitiveness across Irish enterprises has driven a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes delivered by Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland.  These enterprise development Agencies provide financial, technical and experiential support to help manufacturing and services companies become more innovative and more efficient. These programmes encourage and support companies to increase competitiveness, grow their sales and exports and thus develop a basis for sustained and increased employment.Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, is focused on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland provides research, development and technological innovation support relevant at all stages of company development, enabling companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&D activities. Enterprise Ireland funds the undertaking of R&D to support significant in-company projects which have the potential to develop new processes, products and services.In addition, Enterprise Ireland is engaged in efforts to extract maximum value from Ireland's research system — the objective is to work with companies to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales, for technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions. Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.The core role of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)  is to develop and assist the carrying out of oriented basic research in strategic areas for the development and competitiveness of Irish based industry. At present the SFI remit covers the three specific areas of Biotechnology; Information & Communications Technology; and Sustainable Energy/Energy Efficient Technologies (Energy).  During 2012 the Government will be extending SFI's remit to include the capacity to fund both basic and applied research and this will help derive further impacts from the research investment to contribute further to Ireland's economic development.SFI invests in assembling world-class research teams, and in increasing the number of high quality researchers in Ireland so as to make available new scientific knowledge, increased commercial opportunities, and a larger pool of available talent to the Irish workforce — all of which can assist the effort to achieve efficiency and competitiveness gains across various sectors of Ireland's economy.SFI funded researchers involvement with Irish based enterprise continues to grow significantly. The number of SFI researcher collaborations with industry in Ireland has doubled since 2008 to in excess of 530 companies now. These companies employ over 82,000 people in Ireland and through their connectivity with SFI funded researchers, the companies can often avail of new ideas, processes and products to enhance their respective operations.Research, Development and Innovation plays its strategic role as part of Ireland's FDI landscape, embedding existing employment and setting the groundwork for increased future employment. The IDA continues to attract high-quality Foreign Direct Investment projects to Ireland and increasingly Innovation and Technological Development plays a key role in this endeavour. IDA Ireland leverages significant investment in Science Technology and Innovation, at present half the FDI wins are Research and Innovation projects and in 2010 there were 37 investments, worth around €500m. IDA is focused on winning new investments, in particular in sectors such as Life Sciences (Pharma, Biopharma and Medical Devices), ICT and Financial Services.In overall terms that IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies directly accounted for the employment of approximately 300,000 people in the Irish economy. These companies also supported an estimated additional 300,000 indirect jobs.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1379	Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.  The Taoiseach and I discussed these issues with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May last year in Dublin.  During the course of 2011, I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton and Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate Judiciary committee.  I also met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York.  The Government has provided almost $365,000 to support that organisation since 2006.A particular focus of the Government's efforts has been on the achievement of E-3 visas for Ireland.  These E-3s are non-immigrant worker visas, renewable every two years and are currently available to Australian citizens.  Provisions which would allow Irish nationals to apply for E-3 visas were amongst those included in the comprehensive immigration reform Bill as introduced in the US Senate last June by senior Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez.  This Bill would also have helped to resolve the position of the undocumented, including the Irish.  Unfortunately, and not least due to the current US domestic political climate and the Presidential elections taking place there later this year, to date that Bill has not yet received the additional bi-partisan support which it would require to make further progress.Another significant development occurred at the end of November when draft legislation entitled the ‘Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act' (Bill No. HR 3012) emerged from the House of Representatives. Although the political climate for any immigration reform measures remains challenging, the broad bi-partisan support which this draft legislation secured suggested that there might be scope to make progress on Irish E-3s.In early December, Senators Schumer, Leahy and Durbin, all of whom hold leadership positions on the Democratic side of the Senate, came together to co-sponsor a further version of the ‘Fairness' legislation that would include provision under which Irish nationals could apply for up to 10,500 E-3 visas each year.  The Schumer/Leahy/Durbin Bill (number S.1983) also included ‘administrative waiver' provisions which would allow undocumented Irish migrants in the US to apply for E-3s without suffering certain applicable penalties for having been out of status.Separately, Senators Scott Brown and Mark Kirk of the Republican Party tabled further stand-alone legislative proposals (Bill number S. 2005) that would also make Irish nationals eligible to apply for up to 10,500 E-3 visas each year but which do not include the additional ‘administrative waiver' provisions.  Both Bills have since been referred for examination by the US Senate's Judiciary Committee.While recent developments have been encouraging, the prospects for these Bills are uncertain.  Acting on my behalf, our Embassy in Washington, working with the Irish-American immigration community, continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the US Administration at senior levels and with both parties in the US Congress.  I will also be in Washington in early February where I will be engaging with key players to further advance our support for an Irish E-3 visa.

The total cost saving in a full year is estimated at €845,000.The wind down of the resident Embassy has now been completed and the Holy See has agreed to the Government's nomination as our non-resident Ambassador.   He is expected to present his credentials to Pope Benedict later this year.  The Government will continue to review our diplomatic network and it may be that, as public finances recover, we will at some time in the future be able to reopen a modest resident embassy to the Holy See.

I would agree that the pace of progress on necessary constitutional and political reforms in Bosnia-Herzegovina in recent years has been disappointing.  It is important that the newly formed government gives fresh impetus to domestic reforms to ensure Bosnia-Herzegovina moves forward on its path towards EU candidate status.Safeguarding the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the cornerstone of the EU's policy towards Bosnia-Herzegovina and the EU has not hesitated to reject statements questioning the legitimacy of the country's post-Dayton institutions. Ultimately, the EU perspective of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the most powerful tool at the disposal of the international community to help build and maintain stability in the country. The EU is closely engaged in assisting Bosnia-Herzegovina to undertake the reforms necessary to achieve EU candidate status.In terms of the EU's commitment to safeguarding stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would also note the presence of EUFOR Althea, the EU military mission in the country. The mission of Operation Althea, to which Ireland has made a significant contribution over the years, is to provide a military presence in order to contribute to a safe and secure environment, deny conditions for a resumption of violence, and help to implement the Dayton agreement.

In carrying out this role, I will offer my full support to the OSCE's extensive network of institutions and field operations working for regional stability throughout the Western Balkans, as well as the South Caucasus and Central Asia.The OSCE has maintained a Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1995. Mandated by the Dayton Peace Accords, the Mission carries out vital projects in the areas of human rights, judicial reform and security sector capacity building. It has been supported in this work by a number of the OSCE's central institutions, including the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and Strategic Police Matters Unit (SPMU), with whom it has provided training for members of the judiciary and law-enforcement agencies. I commend these operations and their important contribution to the ongoing reconciliation process in the country and wider region.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recently attended the official closing of the OSCE Office in Zagreb in neighbouring Croatia. The Office's successful completion of its mandate is a testament not only to the progress made in the Western Balkans since the 1990s, but also to the effectiveness of OSCE field presences in fostering stability and democratic development in the region.Ireland brings its own unique perspective on conflict resolution to its role as Chair. While recognising that the particular circumstances of all conflicts are very different and that no single set of lessons can provide all the answers, I hope that, where appropriate, we can share our own experience of the peace process in Northern Ireland with other members of OSCE. In my address to the OSCE Permanent Council earlier this month, I outlined my intention to host a conference in April this year presenting aspects of the Northern Ireland example as a case study. Invitations will be issued to all 56 OSCE participating States. In hosting this event, I hope that we can assist others who are engaged in similar peace building efforts throughout the OSCE area.

While it is too early to identify the specific issues as Ireland's main Presidency priorities, enlargement is likely to be a significant item for Ireland's and the European Union's foreign policy agenda during the Presidency.   Bosnia-Herzegovina is a potential candidate country for EU accession since the Thessaloniki European Council of June 2003 reaffirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. As a first step, the Union signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2008 and this will enter into force once its ratification process has been completed. Work arising from this Agreement will continue throughout Ireland's EU Presidency.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1384	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government are of the view that the inability to pay clause for Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) and Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) should be strengthened. In this regard, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly present an amendment to the legislation to provide an inability to pay clause that will allow two consecutive exemptions within the overall two year time limit where this is necessary to safeguard employment.The Deputy will also be aware, in relation to correspondence during an ongoing crisis, that it is important for relationships between institutions to be developed, in order to allow for confidential negotiations to take place, especially on particularly sensitive issues. This is particularly the case in relation to the Irish authorities dealing with the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB (the Troika). It is normal practice for states to protect the confidentiality of these discussions, and in fact is usually enshrined in the rules of association of international institutions.Indeed, this is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act, which provides for exemptions for records relating to, for example, information received in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the financial and economic interests of the state in sections 24, 26 and 31. These factors counterbalance the public interest, protecting the ability of the Government when negotiating or deliberating on matters of national importance. It is considered that release of these records would impact on the integrity and viability of the decision-making process to a significant degree without a countervailing benefit to the public, and would prejudice our relationship with the Troika.  For this reason, I do not intend to release this information.

The most serious risk in this regard is the large scale laundering of markers from mineral oil (diesel), and the onward supply and sale of the laundered product as auto diesel. Marked mineral oil is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition that it is not used in road vehicles.Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils. These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.The Revenue Commissioners are conscious of a number of suspect retail outlets that have opened in various parts of the country and are taking steps to review their compliance with all aspects of the law. In the latter half of 2011 Revenue commenced a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and the challenging of other instances of non-compliance. As part of this drive, warning letters have been issued to unlicensed retail outlets and a number of these have been effectively closed down by the actions of Revenue enforcement teams. This campaign is ongoing and Revenue is in the process of seizing illicit product and closing down a further number of unlicensed or otherwise illegal retail outlets.In 2011 nine oil laundries and 327,000 litres of laundered fuel were seized, together with nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles. Sixteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of two of the cases.   In addition to this a further 718,181 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. To date in 2012, a total of 53,530 litres of Mineral Oil has been seized from retail outlets.The Revenue Commissioners would advise the public to purchase their diesel from known branded outlets, and where they have any concerns or suspicions about a particular outlet to report these to Revenue or the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, which represents the majority of legitimate retail outlets in the State, and who are working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to counteract the threat posed by the sale and distribution of illicit mineral oil.

The Central Bank has advised me that the process of issuing new senior bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors.  Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue. The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the eventual owners of the bonds; also these owners may over time sell the bonds to other investors.Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream). When interest and principal payments are made the bond issuer transfers the required funds to the securities depository company who in turn pay the funds through to the bondholders.  Securities depository companies, such as Clearstream and Euroclear, usually manage, safekeep and administer the securities that it holds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the bonds and the identity of these owners is not disclosed in the public domain or to the issuer.The Department has made detailed enquiries through normal channels to establish the identities of the current owners of the senior bonds. Though it may be possible to establish the geographic location by country of the financial institutions and hedge funds which hold the bonds, it has not been possible to ascertain with any certainty the identities of the relevant bondholders.

It should be noted that such securities were freely tradeable once issued, dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have access to the records of the clearing house and therefore no means of establishing the underlying ownership. Therefore, the offers were communicated to holders via various means including stock exchange announcements, notices to holders via the clearing systems and newspaper notices (where applicable). Holders could then decide whether or not they wished to participate in the offer.

Accordingly, I contacted the respective covered institutions, on behalf of the Deputy, to source the requested information.  The position in relation to the institutions is as follows:InstitutionNumberAverage(rounded)Range of top ten payments (rounded)AIB (overseas disposal of assets)89€69,000€155,000 —€438,000EBS (27 May 2010 on)57€62,800€150,000 —€197,000IL&P (27/06/11 to 31/12/11)316€90,800€241,400 —€451,300IBRC (Jan 2009 on)385€47,800€242,000 —€747,400I am informed by Bank of Ireland that, in the time available, it has not been possible to reply definitively on the issue.  When received I will communicate further with the Deputy.The Deputy should note that the redundancy terms which gave rise to these payments are generally no longer available due to the changed and challenging circumstances at the institutions.  As I have stated previously, the Deputy will appreciate that it is an inevitable, but unfortunate, consequence of the necessary restructuring of the banking system that job losses will arise. The latest terms to be offered were at IBRC and are more reflective of the terms that will be available at the State supported banks.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1389	I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.The Deputy is referring to services on which a taxi operator incurs VAT.  These services (taxi booking service, hire of radios and the provision of administration) are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  The transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage is exempt from VAT under Paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 1 to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  Accordingly, the provision of a taxi service is exempt from VAT.  This is in contrast to the 9% reduced rate of VAT that applies to many services in the hospitality sector.While the provider of a service that is exempt from VAT does not charge VAT on the service they supply, they are also not entitled to deduct, or claim a refund of, any VAT incurred on goods and services used for the purposes of their exempt business.  Thus, a person who provides a taxi service does not register for VAT and cannot recover VAT incurred on costs associated with running their business, such as taxi booking services, the hire of radios and the provision of administration.In relation to the revenue raised through the VAT on taxi booking facilities, radio hire and administration for the past year, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information sought by the Deputy is not directly available from the data maintained by them.

The position is that the tax relief, including the proposed new 30% rate of relief, in respect of interest paid on qualifying loans is given by qualifying lenders.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have already, in advance of the passing of the Finance Act, been in contact with all qualifying lenders to ensure that the necessary software changes to the tax relief at source (TRS) system will be made to cater for the new 30% rate of tax relief and to ensure that, when the full detail of the legislation is available, the relief can be passed on to borrowers by qualifying lenders without undue delay.All qualifying lenders have been requested to confirm when they will be in a position to work with Revenue to implement the Budget 2012 mortgage interest relief changes.  However, it should be noted that the speed with which the software changes necessary to grant the new 30% rate of tax relief to borrowers can be developed and implemented by lenders may vary from lender to lender.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1391	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data available on incomes from which information of the type requested by the Deputy could be derived for all income earners on the income tax record are in respect of the income tax year 2009. The information requested on effective rates of income tax of all income earners in the specified income bands is set out as follows insofar as it is available.Range of Gross IncomeTotal Numbers in income rangeNumbers with an effective tax rate of 30% or less€100,000 —€250,00096,09986,842€250,001 —€500,0009,8955,147€500,001 —€1,000,0002,4951,050Over €1,000,000620261It should be noted that the effective tax rate used to derive the figures in the table above only relates to income tax and does not take account of PRSI and previous charges such as the Income levy and Health Levy.  In 2012, in addition to income tax, high income earners would be liable to PRSI of 4% and top rates of Universal Social Charge of 7% on PAYE income and 10% on self-employed income.The Deputy will be aware that from the tax year 2010 onwards, the high earner's restriction, applicable to those who make significant use of certain specified tax reliefs, has been further tightened such that a 30% effective tax rate applies for those subject to the full restriction.  These reliefs do not include those for health expenses and the standard tax credits, which are available to all taxpayers.The figures in the table are based on details from tax returns on record at the time the data for each year were compiled for analytical purposes. This was generally based on coverage levels representing in or about 95% of all returns expected.  The effective rate of income tax for each income earner with gross income in excess of €100,000 in 2009 is calculated as the percentage of total tax liability to gross income.It should be noted that the income ranges shown in the above table relate to Gross Income as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2010.  A married couple that have elected or have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one taxpayer.

For completeness I have included the relevant figures for INBS.  In 2009 the Government provided capital in the amount €4 billion to Anglo Irish Bank. The capital was provided in the cash paid directly from the Exchequer.  Further, during 2009 it was determined that Anglo and INBS required additional capital. A commitment was provided by the Minister to Anglo and separately to INBS to provide capital of €8.3 billion and €2.7 billion, respectively. This capital was provided on 31 March 2010.In relation to Anglo, this €8.3 billion of capital was injected by way of a capital contribution. This capital contribution is treated as equity capital for regulatory capital purposes. In relation to INBS, a special investment share was acquired for €100 million in cash and a further €2.6 billion was subsequently injected by way of a capital contribution.The Government did not pay for these capital contributions in Anglo and INBS with cash. The Government effectively issued an IOU, in the form of promissory notes, to Anglo and INBS for €8.3 billion and €2.6 billion, respectively.  As the State had a debt to the institutions, it also had an associated interest charge. This interest charge was set by reference to Government yields at the date of issue on 31 March 2010.Subsequently, it was determined that Anglo and INBS needed additional capital, which was again provided by increasing the 31 March 2010 promissory notes. The final promissory note increase was on 31 December 2010 bringing the total promissory notes in Anglo and INBS to €30.6 billion. See table below for the increases:€billionAngloINBSTotal (IBRC)31 March 20108.302.6010.9028 May 20102.00—2.0023 August 20108.58—8.5831 December 20106.422.709.1225.305.3030.60When the final capital contribution was made on 31 December 2011 an interest holiday was inserted into each of the promissory notes which meant that between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 no interest was payable. Absent the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate on these promissory notes would have been 5.8%. However, as a result of the insertion of the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate from 1 January 2013 is 8.2%.While there was an interest holiday this does not affect the promissory note repayments of the principal amount. The cash flows on the promissory notes are 10% (€3.06 billion) of the original amount per annum until the full amount is repaid. Set out below is a detailed aggregated schedule of capital repayments and interest payments on the promissory notes.€bnTotal Interest Paid: ATotal Capital Reduction: BRepayments: A + B31/03/20110.552.513.0631/03/2012—3.063.0631/03/20130.492.573.0631/03/20141.841.223.0631/03/20151.751.313.0631/03/20161.651.413.0631/03/20171.551.513.0631/03/20181.441.623.0631/03/20191.321.743.0631/03/20201.191.873.0631/03/20211.062.003.0631/03/20220.912.153.0631/03/20230.752.313.0631/03/20240.571.522.0931/03/20250.450.470.9131/03/20260.390.520.9131/03/20270.330.580.9131/03/20280.260.650.9131/03/20290.190.730.9131/03/20300.100.810.9131/03/20310.010.050.0516.830.647.4*These numbers may not tot exactly as a result of roundingAs set out above, the total interest cost for the State for all tranches of the Anglo and Irish Nationwide promissory notes is €16.8 billion with annual repayments of €3.06 billion per annum until 2023, reducing thereafter until 2031 when the final repayment is made. These annual repayments reduce over time as the various tranches of the promissory notes are repaid. The final payment on the promissory notes of circa €0.1 billion will be made on 31 March 2031. The total cost of the promissory notes including the principle amount and interest will be €47.4 billion over the life of the promissory notes.The Deputy will be aware that the funds which become available to the State as a result of borrowing undertaken by the Exchequer are not generally assigned to one particular area of expenditure. Rather they are available, along with the funds sourced from revenues such as tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital receipts, to fund overall expenditure. Accordingly, there was no one tranche of borrowing that was undertaken solely for the purpose of funding the Promissory Note payments to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.The draw downs of funds so far under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support have been used for a range of different purposes including of course the general running of the day-to-day operations of the State. It is not possible therefore to isolate borrowings undertaken to fund the Promissory Note payments or their costs. However, for illustrative purposes, on the basis of the original 5.8% blended average interest rate which applied to borrowing under the Programme, the interest costs on borrowing of €3,060 million would be just under €180 million per annum. In light of the recently agreed reduction in interest rates on funding available under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support however, the estimated interest cost on such borrowing reduces to approximately €115 million per annum.While the State has budgeted to meet both the interest and cash requirements I am eager to have the Promissory Notes examined to see if they can be re-engineered in a better way for the State, for example, by lengthening their maturity and reducing the interest rate on them. This examination, which has commenced, will have to be completed in a manner which does not impact on the capital position of Anglo. The Troika have recently agreed to engage with us at a technical level to prepare a common paper which will examine the various options in terms of structure, interest rate, duration etc. with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State. In tandem with this the Government is engaging at a political level, with the ECB, the Commission and across Member States to garner support in this regard.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1393	The position is that with effect from 1 January 2012, the annual threshold for exemption from the Universal Social Charge (USC) has been increased from €4,004 to €10,036.  An individual who will have income in the tax year 2012 that will not exceed this amount will not be chargeable to USC.  However, where this threshold is exceeded, the entire amount is chargeable.  Where an individual has a number of employments, the threshold applies to the aggregate income from all the employments and not to income per employment.Since 1 January 2012, the way in which USC is deducted by employers and pension providers and paid over to Revenue has been brought into line with the way in which the PAYE system operates in respect of income tax.  This is known as the cumulative system of deduction.  As part of the changeover to the cumulative system, Revenue reviewed its historical records to identify those individuals who are most likely, based on this review, to have annual income below €10,036 in the tax year 2012.  The employers and pension providers of the individuals identified as a result of this process were then formally instructed by Revenue in December 2011 not to deduct USC from wages and pensions paid in 2012.The review of historical records to identify those individuals who are most likely to be exempt based on the level of their income over the past number of years had to be done before the end of the 2011 tax year; consequently income levels in 2011 could not form part of this exercise.  This meant that instructions may have been issued to employers and pension providers to deduct USC from some individuals who should have been exempt.  Likewise, instructions may have issued to exempt some individuals who will not be exempt from USC in 2012.Examples of the type of cases where this may have happened include:Where the historical records show that an individual's income in recent years was greater than the new USC threshold of €10,036, but because of a change in the level of income in   2011, the individual's 2012 income is now unlikely to exceed the threshold.Where the historical records show that an individual's income in recent years was under the new USC threshold of €10,036, but because of a change in the level of income in 2011, the individual's 2012 income is now likely to exceed the threshold.Where an individual may have returned to the workforce sometime in 2011 after a considerable absence and there is no historical data on record to establish the possible level of their income in 2012.Where an individual may have retired in 2011 and the change in their income has not yet been reported to Revenue.Where the instruction that was issued by Revenue to employers and pension providers does not reflect the fact that the individual is likely to be exempt from USC in 2012 and who, as a consequence, is now having USC deducted from his or her wages or pension, the individual should contact the Revenue office dealing with his or her tax affairs (either by telephone, email or letter) and Revenue will issue a new instruction to their employer or pension provider to cease the deduction of USC and to refund any USC already deducted since 1 January 2012.  Likewise, in a case where Revenue has instructed an employer or pension provider not to deduct USC where USC should have been deducted, the individual concerned should also contact Revenue to allow Revenue to issue a new instruction to the individual's employer or pension provider to deduct USC from wages or pensions.  Individuals are encouraged to contact their Revenue office without delay in order to obtain refunds as soon as possible or to avoid the build up of arrears.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1394	I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.With effect from 1 January 2012, there is an exempt annual threshold of €10,036 for Universal Social Charge (USC) purposes.  An individual who has income in a tax year that does not exceed this amount is not chargeable to USC.  However, where this threshold is exceeded, the entire amount is chargeable.  The standard rates of charge are:2% on the first €10,036,4% on the next €5,980, and7% on the balance.There is no general exemption from USC for individuals in possession of a full medical card, and/or who are aged 70 years or over.  However, the maximum rate of charge for such individuals is 4% irrespective of the level of their income, unless they have self-employment income in excess of €100,000 for a tax year, in which case the maximum rate rises to 7% on the amount of the excess over €100,000.  For medical cardholders, this reduced rate of USC only applies to individuals who have a fullmedical card and not to individuals who have a G.P. Visit Card or a European Health Insurance Card.A new development for the tax year 2012 and future tax years is the regular transmission of data from the HSE to Revenue in relation to individuals who have been issued with a full medical card.  The first transmission of this data was received by Revenue in October 2011.  This data was used as the basis for instructing employers and pension providers to deduct USC at a maximum rate of 4% when paying wages or pensions to the relevant individuals during 2012.  Given that the data only related to the holders of medical cards prior to October 2011, employers and pension providers may not be deducting USC at the correct rate from individuals who received full medical cards subsequently.  There is also the possibility that an individual who had a medical card prior to October 2011 may have had the card withdrawn or cancelled subsequently in which case employers and pension providers may be deducting too little USC.If an individual who has a full medical card, and/or is aged 70 years or over and who will not have self-employment income in excess of €100,000 for the tax year 2012, is being charged USC at a rate in excess of 4%, he or she should contact their local Revenue office and advise them of the correct position.  Revenue will then issue a new instruction to the employer or pension provider to reduce the rate at which USC is being deducted and to refund whatever excess USC has already been deducted since 1 January 2012.Likewise, in a case where a medical card has been withdrawn or cancelled and Revenue has instructed an employer or pension provider to deduct USC at the lower rate where USC should have been deducted at the higher rate, the individual concerned should also contact Revenue to allow Revenue to issue a new instruction to the individual's employer or pension provider to deduct USC from wages or pensions at the correct rate.  Individuals are encouraged to contact their Revenue office without delay so as to obtain refunds as soon as possible or to avoid the build up of arrears.

Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 provides the legislative basis for the requirement for manufacturers or distributors to provide a declaration to the Revenue Commissioners of statutory chargeable values (or open market selling prices —OMSPs — as they are referred to) for all new vehicles in the State for vehicle registration tax (VRT) purposes.The OMSPs of new vehicles are required as the basis for assessing VRT liability. They are considered by the declarants to contain commercially sensitive information, which they declared to the Revenue Commissioners on a confidential basis and on the understanding they will be held in confidence by them and not released to third parties.

Quoted investments in the Discretionary Portfolio were valued at close of business on 31 December 2011 and investments in indirect investment vehicles were based on the most recently available valuations as at that date.  Final year-end valuations in respect of the Discretionary Portfolio and the Directed Portfolio will be provided in the NPRF Commission's Annual Report for 2011 which is expected to be published in the middle of 2012.  At 31 December 2010 the total value of the Fund was €22.7 billion, comprising the Discretionary Portfolio of €15.1 billion and the Directed Portfolio of €7.6 billion.At 31 December 2009 the total value of the Fund was €22.3 billion, comprising the Discretionary Portfolio of €15.3 billion and the Directed Portfolio of €7.0 billion. 2009 was the first year in which investments were made under the direction of the Minister for Finance in securities issued by Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  At 31 December 2008 the total value of the Fund was €16.1 billion.  At 31 December 2007 the total value of the Fund was €21.1 billion.  At 31 December 2006 the total value of the Fund was €18.9 billion.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1401	I understand from FÁS that it is not appropriate to change the entry profile for these type of courses because the nature of the course is built on the learner having prior knowledge as ultimately the graduates from these programmes will work for ordinary house holders and occupants/owners of commercial enterprises.  FÁS must be able to stand over the quality of the training that these graduates receive in the context of standards of competence/prior qualifications for safety around, for example, plumbing and live electrical systems and panels.  This prior competence needs to be transparent in the form of a recognised qualification.In that regard recognition of prior learning is a possible option.  If the learner was registered with FÁS or ANCO then application should be made to FÁS for recognition of prior learning.  However, if the learner was never registered with FÁS then application to FETAC for award determination should be made.  In relation to the formal recognition of trade related work experience of the person in question FAS have informed me that those with trade related work experience can validate their competence through the apprenticeship system.  To avail of this the person must: 1. Register as an apprentice with a FÁS approved employer; 2. Submit a portfolio of evidence and application for Phase exemptions.  No applicant will be awarded a full exemption and all applicants will be required to undertake a minimum of phases 6 and 7.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1403	The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department's main responsibility is  to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  In this regard, the Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands nationally, as well as the demands in the area to which the Deputy refers, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  I have previously committed to publishing shortly a five year plan outlining the school building projects to be constructed in that time.It is the responsibility of individual managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied  fairly in respect of all applicants.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Education Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

Chinese and Portuguese are not on the curriculum. A Post Primary Languages Initiative has been in place since 2000 with the objective of diversifying language provision in schools, focusing particularly on Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Russian.  81% of second level pupils study three languages, Irish, English and a continental language, to completion of upper second level, and over 70% of schools offer two foreign languages or more.  Russian is offered as a curricular language as part of the Post-Primary languages initiative.  It is offered in 20 schools and 625 students are currently studying Russian.  The State Examinations Commission also provides examinations in a range of "non-curricular EU languages", including Portuguese.Students at third level have access to a wide range of foreign language courses that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines.  Details of Portuguese, Russian and Chinese language programmes which are offered in the third level institutions are available on the Qualifax website www.qualifax.ie.  There are no statistics available to my Department regarding the numbers of students studying those languages in third level  institutions.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1405	The information requested by the Deputy is set out in tabular form.It will be seen that participation in Physics has declined, but a greater proportion are taking the subject at higher level than heretofore. Chemistry and Applied Maths have shown modest increases. Biology has expanded rapidly, allied with an increase in the proportion taking the subject at higher level. Participation in higher level Mathematics has declined from a high of 18.9% in 2005 to 15.8% in 2011.  In all subjects other than Mathematics, participation is predominantly at the higher level. Across all subjects, students who choose higher level generally score well, with 70-81% gaining at least a grade C3 at higher level.A major programme of reform under Project Maths began in all second level schools in September 2010, building on the experience of 24 project schools which started the initiative in 2008. Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and to ensure better curriculum continuity across the system. A key objective is to improve grades in Maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.It has also been agreed to provide 25 bonus CAO points for all candidates who score Grade D3 or above for higher level Maths in the Leaving Cert from 2012.  This should incentivise more students to continue with higher level. It is hoped that the bonus points for Maths and the new project maths syllabus, alongside the Government's Literacy and Numeracy plan, published in July last will improve students' grasp and grades in Mathematics.The Literacy and Numeracy Plan provides for an increase in the amount of time spent teaching maths in primary schools, by 70 minutes per week as well as a range of other measures to promote improved performance in this area. In regard to science, where students perform above the international average in PISA, I expect to receive revised syllabuses for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology from the NCCA later this year.

The ratios which had previously applied are set out in my Departments Circular SP ED 02/05, which is available on www.education.ie.There are no plans to reduce the overall number of learning support/resource teachers provided to schools under the General Allocation Model (GAM). GAM allocations for primary schools will be updated from September 2012, through a redistribution of the existing GAM learning support resources, based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year, which are themselves based on the preceding years enrolments.The rationale for applying differing ratios for boys and girls schools is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls.The NCSE Report on the Implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, of 2006, also examined a range of sources to establish prevalence rates, including national databases, local and international studies and expert estimates, which indicated significantly higher rates of Mild General Learning Difficulty and Specific Learning Disability prevailing in boys, in comparison to girls.The revised arrangements will apply to all of the all girls primary schools from September 2012 and the actual allocation which will be made for each school will be based on the based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year.

It is the duty of the board to provide, or cause to be provided, an appropriate education for all students attending the school.  In September 2009 my Department issued circulars 59/2009 and 60/2009.  These circulars provide a framework for schools to manage underperformance and conduct issues.In relation to professional competence the procedures recognise that, in the first instance, it is the responsibility of each teacher to maintain appropriate standards and address any professional competence issues he or she may experience.  It is also accepted that a significant majority of teachers discharge their duties competently and efficiently, and that the procedures for addressing professional competence issues are aimed at a minority within the profession.  The procedures also note that these issues may be of a transient or short-term duration.  Where a parental complaint raises an issue of professional competence the parent will be advised that these procedures have been invoked and the outcome of the process.

It will be a post primary school for 1000 pupils and it is anticipated that the first intake of pupils will be in September 2013.The construction of the new school will be delivered in phases. The first phase of accommodation will be capable of catering for a minimum of 350 pupils and comprise of circa 2,400m2.  Along with general classroom accommodation, phase one will include specialist accommodation such as music/drama area, business/computer room, science laboratory, art/craft room, home economics, technical graphics and construction studies/engineering/technology rooms.Phase two of the building project will provide over 7000 additional square metres of accommodation to cater for the full projected enrolment of 1000 students. The brief for this phase of the development will include general classrooms, specialist rooms, a Special Educational Needs Unit and ancillary accommodation. The brief will also provide for a PE Hall and, subject to the provision of funding by Fingal County Council, an enhanced Community Facility. The combined PE Hall and Community Facility will comprise just over 2000 square metres of the accommodation to be provided in this phase. It is anticipated that phase two of the new school will be ready for occupation by students in September 2014.

However, the change must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.  I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in second-level schools over the level originally planned. This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students.A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.

Applications are processed in date order of receipt and every effort is being made to process these applications as quickly as possible.  Applications received in July 2011 are currently being processed.Extra resources have been assigned to the Redundancy Unit to ensure that Special Needs Assistants that have been made redundant will have their claims for payment processed as quickly as possible. My Department is also now prioritising the processing of redundancy applications from those SNAs who have not obtained alternative employment in a non-teaching capacity in primary, secondary or community/comprehensive schools in the current school year.

The Office of Public Works on behalf of the Department are engaged in pre-contract enquiries in relation to the special conditions within the contract. Due to commercial sensitivities, I am not in a position to comment on the matter any further.  Once the site acquisition process is concluded, the proposed school building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including the school in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year. The Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years. In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands nationally as well as the demands in the area to which the Deputy refers, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. I have previously committed to publishing shortly a five year plan outlining the school building projects to be constructed in that time.

Under the recent budget measures this will increase to 21:1 with effect from September, 2012. The budget measures also provide for guidance to be managed in the future by all schools from within their standard staffing allocation.Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its pupils. Decisions on how this is done are best determined at individual school level.

The most recent information available relates to the 2010/2011 school year. Statistical information in respect of the current school year is currently being compiled in my Department and is due for publication in September 2012.The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedules for the current school year and for the coming school year were published on my Department's website in March and December 2011 respectively.My Department's focus is on implementing the staffing arrangements for the coming school year and I do not propose to divert scarce staffing resources to deal with the individual type queries from the Deputy.  My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for 2012/13 school year.

However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the telephonist service in Revenue's Athlone office was provided on a temporary agency basis by the National Council for the Blind following the retirement of a Revenue employee in 2005. However, the telephone system for the Westmeath-Offaly district needed to be replaced as the older system could no longer provide the required business functionality and replacement parts were no longer available. The replacement system, which operates effectively in many Revenue office, enables the service to be provided without the need for an operator thereby resulting in significant cost savings.

The Agreement sets out the detailed arrangements that apply.  The Agreement provides that redeployment in the local government sector "will generally take precedence over recruitment (including fixed term employees), transfers and promotions except in circumstances where special skills are identified or where the post cannot otherwise be filled through redeployment arising from geographical or other constraints, or to meet essential manpower planning and business needs" (para 6.5.5, page 80 of the Agreement).
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1424	The issue of restructuring the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is under consideration within my Department and various options have been considered. It is my intention, however, to ensure that any opportunity presented by CEB restructuring will not simply be about reducing or changing the numbers of CEBs in existence but will be used as an opportunity to fundamentally reform, streamline and revitalise the manner in which the State supports the valuable micro-enterprise sector.In particular, I want to ensure that State support is delivered in a cohesive manner and that there is a targeted local delivery of enterprise support, driven by a national enterprise policy, in a manner which eliminates overlap and duplication and which makes it easier for the end-user to access the necessary supports and services which can help the sustainability and growth of his/her business. Any savings to be made through any restructuring programme will only become known when the final details of the restructuring are agreed.An Exchequer allocation of funding for the CEBs is made each year under the Estimates process. The Capital allocation for 2012 is €15million as, notwithstanding the pressures on public sector finances, the Department has sought to maintain its provision of Exchequer Capital funding for direct supports to CEB micro-enterprise clients (i.e. grants and their range of "soft supports" such as business advice, training and mentoring). Individual allocations of funding are made to each CEB by their CEB Central Coordination Unit (CCU), located within Enterprise Ireland, based on well-established criteria and are being finalised at this time. In addition, subject to additional funding becoming available during the course of the year, full consideration is given by the Department to make such funds available to the CEBs for their micro-enterprise support activities.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1425	I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 98 together.Last year, I secured the agreement of Government to draft legislation to ease the regulatory burden on co-operative societies and to make it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation.  I hope to publish a Draft Bill during 2012 and I expect that the amendments I am proposing will make the co-operative model more attractive for those wishing to use it.By introducing these legislative changes for co-operatives, the Government is recognising the value of the co-operative business model to our economy, particularly at the present time.  The primary objective of these legislative changes is to provide a regulatory environment that is supportive of the co-operative movement and of its capacity to contribute to economic and social well-being into the future.   By applying the limited resources of my Department in this way I hope to play my part in facilitating the development of co-operatives in the International Year of Co-operatives.My responsibility lies in the legislative provision for co-operatives in general.  Any initiatives to facilitate or promote the development of co-operatives in particular sectors, for example group water schemes, renewable energy or agricultural co-operatives, would be a matter for my colleagues in the respective Government Departments.In relation to ILO recommendation 2002 (R193), this is a matter which will be considered in the context of a wider review of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, work on which is dependent to an extent on progress made on the finalisation and enactment of the Companies Bill, which is my priority in this area at present.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1426	Data on the levels of employment in the economy is compiled by the Central Statistics Office on a quarterly basis through their Quarterly National Household Survey. This survey measures the total numbers in employment and the total number of people unemployed each quarter and records the net annual change in these categories.Figures in respect of the number of jobs created or lost in firms assisted by the enterprise development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, are compiled annually by Forfás and published in the agency's Annual Employment Survey. Details of the number of jobs created in agency-assisted companies in 2009 and 2010 set out on Table 1.  These are the last two years for which complete information is available.Full data for 2011 will not be available until later this year.  However, the IDA has already indicated that it supported the creation of 13,000 new jobs in 2011 and the number of jobs lost in its client companies decreased, resulting in a net increase of over 6,000 jobs.  Enterprise Ireland has indicated that employment in its client companies stabilised last year.Building on these positive results, I am currently finalising an Action Plan for Jobs for Government approval which will set out a series of clear actionable measures across Government to support the creation and retention of jobs across the economy.  As well as setting out specific measures to support jobs growth, the Action Plan will seek to address key factors which can act as obstacles to job creation and retention.  These include issues such as costs of doing business, access to finance, administrative burdens on business, the need to improve company capability and access to new markets.20092010Job Gains14,27217,582Job Losses45,92723,704Net change-31,655-6,122Source: Forfás Annual Employment Survey
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1427	In general terms, business decline, resulting in job losses, often arises due to a combination of issues affecting the long-term viability of a company, rather than a singular difficulty. In this context, some of the most commonly stated primary reasons for business decline and consequent job losses include:significant decreases in customer/market demand due to the recession in Ireland and in key trading partners;financial difficulties (insolvency, bankruptcy, bad debts, inability to raise finance);increased competition from competitor companies (in some cases exacerbated by volatility in exchanges rates);loss of key customers;rationalisation/consolidation/restructuring of Group structures involving the closure of a company unit.Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core. The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate job creation. Key areas which I have been working on to support job creation by enterprise include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance and supporting innovation.The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving the Smart Economy.  The allocation of €514 million in Capital funding to my Department's agencies for 2012 will ensure the core programmes of the enterprise agencies are sustained and targeted as well as driving investment in research and development. This investment will drive recovery in the economy by facilitating the winning of foreign direct investments, the growth of indigenous exports and the creation of sustainable jobs.The Government will shortly be publishing its 2012 Action Plan for Jobs which will set out a series of clear actionable measures across Government to support the creation and retention of jobs in a range of the sectors, including the manufacturing, services and the commercial sectors.  The Action Plan will be published in the coming weeks, following its approval by Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1428	I propose to take Questions  Nos. 105, 106 and 108 together.The Government is determined to address the jobs crisis in a real way. If we are to create the numbers of jobs we need we must build aggressively on the major strengths we have.  We recognise that indigenous Irish companies have the potential to significantly increase their trade, in particular their exports, and become real indigenous engines of growth.  We have in Ireland a foreign multinational sector that has served us well and we will continue to encourage world leading companies to locate pioneering parts of their businesses here. We must seek to attract international entrepreneurs to start new businesses in Ireland.  We are striving to ensure that the companies located in Ireland can lead the world in vital processes that add value and create employment.  Ireland's open economy needs to have the export of goods and services at the heart of its economic strategy.  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have set-out an approach which is focused on economic recovery, by delivering improvements in competitiveness, ensuring companies have access to the finance they need to grow and by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success which will lead to jobs and export growth.In this endeavour, my Department and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created. Enterprise development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland,  provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes, that deliver  financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which  sustainable employment will grow and expand. It is my view that Innovation and the use of technology will be among the core drivers of job creation in Ireland's key sectors during 2012 and into the coming years.The detailed information which you have requested is not available but I can provide information which will give you a snapshot of the present situation and provide an appreciation of the grave situation and the challenges we, as a Government, face in achieving a turn around.Total employment (full and part time) in Enterprise Ireland client companies stood at 162,692 in 2011.  Of these, 141,228 are full-time jobs — a similar number to last year while 21,464 are part-time/contract jobs — a slight increase on last year. During the year  9,076 full-time jobs were created by EI client companies while 9,070 were lost. A gain in part-time/contract jobs of 2,012 was made in 2011 over 2010. Employment in client companies of Enterprise Ireland therefore stabilised during the year 2011.IDA investment is a key stimulator and driver of the economy through its contribution to exchequer finances, exports and R&D.  In making his 2011 end of year statement, the Chief Executive Officer of IDA Ireland announced that IDA Ireland's client companies created over 13,000 new jobs, up 20% on the previous year's level of 10,897, increasing the total number of those employed directly in companies supported by the agency to almost 146,000. Overall there was a net employment increase of over 6,000.  In line with its revised strategy "Horizon 2020" IDA is charged with creating 62,000 direct new jobs by 2014. This stretch target requires IDA to grow job creation from 10,000 in 2010 to 17,000 per annum while reducing job losses through transformation. The total impact from this new jobs creation will be 105,000 jobs by 2014 due to the multiplier effect of FDI jobs. In overall terms IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies directly accounted for the employment of approximately 300,000 people in the Irish economy. These companies also supported an estimated additional 300,000 indirect jobs.Science Foundation Ireland supports initiatives to make available new scientific knowledge, increased commercial opportunities, and a larger pool of available talent to the Irish workforce — all of which can assist the effort to achieve efficiency and competitiveness gains across various sectors of Ireland's economy.  The number of SFI researcher collaborations with industry in Ireland is in excess of 530 companies. These companies employ over 82,000 people in Ireland and through their connectivity with SFI funded researchers, the companies can avail of new ideas, processes and products to enhance their respective operations.The extent to which companies access and benefit from Innovation and Technology programmes may be seen from the following — Enterprise Ireland has a range of programmes and soft supports focusing on innovation which will support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets. The following were  among the supports accessed by businesses over 2010 and 2011:173 new High Potential Start-Up Companies supported.166 client companies were approved financial support in excess of €100,000 for significant R&D projects.More than 730 EI client companies undertook R&D projects in excess of €100k in 2011.Close to €65m in International Research Funding secured for companies.Over 1,000 Innovation Vouchers redeemed by small companies to carry out specific company related research.More than 100 licences transferred to industry from research which will be the basis for new developments and opportunities.A total of 225 companies were supported to undertake Lean projects to increase productivity, drive down costs and introduce continuous process improvements in their business.In excess of 500 Managers participated on long-course development programmes.137 companies were involved in Technology Centres at end-2011 which facilitates collaborative research on  an industry led agenda.Research, Development and Innovation plays a strategic role as part of Ireland's FDI landscape, embedding existing employment and setting the groundwork for increased future employment. In 2011, IDA highlights of the impact of IDA Investment  included—Over 13,000 new jobs created, up 20% on 2010.A record total of 148 investments won, up 17% on the previous year.Circa €700 million in new R&D investment.61 new companies investing in Ireland for the first time, up 30% on 2010.IDA client companies spend €19 billion in the Irish economy.IDA client companies paid €6.9 billion in payroll.Of the 148 FDI investments made in 2011, a record number of 61 were from multinational companies investing in Ireland for the first time while 87 were made by existing client companies. Of existing client investments, 46 were expansions while 41 were in research and development.The remit of Science Foundation Ireland covers the specific areas of Biotechnology, Information and Communications Technology and Sustainable Energy/Energy Efficiency Technology. SFI investments have had the following impacts—Over the past decade SFI has built a community of approx. 3000 researchers in Ireland's higher education institutes, led by 300 lead scientists.Having built a solid research base SFI has constructed 28 large, industry-connected centres, where companies partner with SFI research groups to pursue industrially relevant research.245 SMEs and 237 multinationals now link to SFI research groups, ranging from informal connections to collaborations that involve significant financial sponsorship. The goal of these relationships is to make those companies more competitive via transferring technology and trained people out of the labs and into the companies.As regards the future I intend to bring about a step change in public investment in research and innovation. The Steering Group on research prioritisation, led by Jim O'Hara, recommended 14 areas of application which should receive the major part of public investment in research because of the potential of these areas to deliver jobs.  I am bringing forward proposals to Government imminently to give effect to the recommendations of the Steering Group and focus research funders' programmes accordingly.  I will also be publishing the report of the Steering Group so that the evidence and analysis underpinning the recommendations is available to all stakeholders.The Government will shortly be publishing its 2012 Action Plan for Jobs which will highlight the importance of innovation to enterprise growth and job creation.  The Action Plan will also identify a number of sectors where Ireland has strengths and can gain a competitive edge and will set out a series of clear actionable measures to maximise job opportunities in those sectors.  I am currently finalising the Action Plan for Approval by Government.

As of 20 January 2012, 2,395 persons are engaged with 5,000 to be employed when Tús is fully operational later this Spring.  Tús is focused on those people who are on the live register for 12 months or more and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance. Participants are identified by the Department of Social Protection by applying the following conditions:A person must be unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for at least 12 months, andCurrently be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, andBe fully unemployed.Following selection, participants are referred to one of the 52 Local Development Companies or Údarás na Gaeltachta where their skills and interests are profiled and matched to available positions offered by the community, voluntary and not-for-profit sector locally.  In general, all works and services undertaken or delivered by the community and voluntary sectors for the benefit of the general community or specific sectors can be considered eligible.  The funds allocated for 2012 amount to €84m.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1436	The average time taken to award a claim for carer's allowance in the quarter ending Sept 2011 was 17 weeks.  The average time to award for the last quarter of 2011 is unavailable as, due to the phased introduction of a new claims processing system in the carer's allowance area, new claims are being processed on the new system while older claims are still being processed on the old system.As mentioned above, a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.Some 7,800 applications are awaiting a decision at present, down from 8,540 at the beginning of September 2011.   I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.  In addition to dealing with the approximately 330 new carer's allowance applications that are received each week, overtime working is being applied to help reduce backlogs that have built up chiefly as a result of the effort associated with the service delivery modernisation project.  However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted that some individual claims may continue to take a longer time to process because of their complexity. Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet his or her needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, he or she can apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from the department's community welfare service.
Question No. 117 withdrawn.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1437	Community Employment schemes provide a very important and valued contribution to social employment, training and progression for unemployed people. Furthermore, many Community Employment schemes provide vital community services right across the country.  There are currently 1,143 CE schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 participants. I have protected the number of places on CE so that the most vulnerable in our society can continue to avail of Community Employment and provide value services to their communities.  There are no reductions in the number of CE places for 2012.Following on from changes to the materials grant for Community Employment schemes announced in Budget 2012, I have directed that an initial review of the financial resources of all schemes this is now ongoing and will be completed in March 2012. It is also being carried out in the context that there are community and voluntary sponsoring organisations that receive funding from a multiplicity of state agencies. Alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly with reference to funding from other state agencies to avoid duplication.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.The outcomes of this review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.  I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no Community Employment Scheme will close pending the completion of this review.Those persons currently engaged on a Community Employment (CE) programme and in receipt of any of the following social welfare payments will retain their concurrent payments until they have either exhausted their eligibility to participate on the scheme, they leave the scheme voluntarily or if they are still present on the scheme at the final cut-off date for receipt of the concurrent payment in December 2014.One Parent Family PaymentDeserted Wife's BenefitWidow(er)'s PensionIllness BenefitDisability AllowanceInvalidity PensionBlind PensionPersons in receipt of One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Benefit and Widow(er)'s Pension will no longer retain the CE-funded child dependant allowance. They will retain the child dependant allowance on their original social welfare payment. The net reduction in combined income to a person currently on CE and in receipt of One Parent Family Payment (OPFP) is as follows:No. of Children€1 child€22.30 per week2 children€37.10 per week3 children€51.90 per week4 children€66.70 per week5 children€81.50 per week6 children€97.30 per weekThe reason the difference is less than the basic €29.80 child dependant rate is due to the retained OPFP being reassessed upwards due to less Community Employment (CE) income being means-assessed against it. The reduced €130 income disregard has also been taken into account in these calculations.New participants to CE will only receive the equivalent of what they received on the original social welfare payment plus the €20 CE participation bonus, all paid under their CE allowances.  Given the exigency of the current budgetary situation facing my Department, I cannot reinstate the budgets to 2011 levels.

However, according the SWAO annual reports, of the time taken to process appeals, the number of weeks attributable to the Department were as follows:YearNo. of weeks20068 weeks200710 weeks20089 weeks200910.5 weeks201012.7 weeks201113.7 weeksIt is clear from these figures that the average length of time taken to submit files has increased and this is attributable to the increased workloads being experienced by the scheme areas and the increased volume of requests for submissions from the SWAO as economic conditions deteriorated.These processing times cover all aspects of the work involved in reviewing cases where appeals are received and in preparing files for submission to the SWAO.  In the majority of cases, where notice of an appeal is received, the case will be reviewed by the Deciding Officer who made the initial decision.  As part of that review:there may be additional evidence which may impact on his or her original decision and which must be followed up with the customer;there may be additional evidence which may warrant further investigation by a social welfare inspector;the customer may be afforded a second medical assessment by a different Medical Assessor to the one who gave the original unfavourable opinion.The file is returned to the Appeals Office once the Deciding Officer is satisfied that his or her original decision is robust and once he or she has prepared a submission addressing the issues raised by the appellant in support of the appeal.The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers and works to ensure that claims are processed in the most efficient way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme and to ensure, insofar as is possible, that funding is targeted at those most in need. In order to meet the challenges posed by the increasing volumes of claims, the department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the deployment of new computer systems.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1445	My Department accepts reports of possible fraud from members of the public in relation to the operation of its schemes and uses both a dedicated phone number and a facility on the Department's website for this purpose. Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail as possible about the case they are reporting and they can do so anonymously.  All anonymous or confidential reports are examined and, where relevant, are referred to Scheme owners and/or to the Department's Inspectors.The 4,036 cases to which the Deputy refers were cases received in 2011 where it was not possible to issue a report for investigation due to a number of reasons.  These included (i) a lack of information, (ii) a claim not being in payment, or (iii) the information reported did not impact on entitlement.   These reports are made anonymously to the Department and, therefore, it is not possible to identify who has made them.  In view of the anonymity of these reports, it would not be feasible to introduce any new legislation in this regard.However, the Deputy should note that it is the experience of the Department's inspectors that only a very small minority of these anonymous reports may have been made maliciously.  It is also important to note that a payment is not normally suspended or stopped solely on the basis of an anonymous report. The anonymous report, however, may be a trigger for the instigation of a review of a customer's entitlement.A Social Welfare Inspector may then deem it appropriate to interview the customer and to carry out a full review of the circumstances and means of the customer in order to determine on-going entitlement to the relevant payment. The Inspector may then send his report on the case to one of the Department's deciding officers for a decision regarding entitlement. Where the review indicates that the customer is not entitled to the relevant payment, the claim may be suspended, reduced or terminated.My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  Therefore, it is the Department's policy to review all customers on an on-going basis, and in addition, all cases of suspected abuse are referred for investigation. However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.

It is organised in every Member State by the Public Employment Service of that State. Some Member States with land borders and a high degree of mobility across these Borders also have regional Eures Partnerships which aim to facilitate workers who commute across the Border for work purposes. The purpose of Eures is to help Employers who are having difficulties sourcing qualified staff locally and nationally to find workers from other Member States. At the same time Eures helps Job Seekers find work in other Member States. It offers them a comprehensive advise and information on labour opportunities as well as information on living and working conditions in all Member States of the EU and EEA.The Commission have identified efficient free movement between Member States as key measure to increase the competitiveness of the overall European Economy and are suggesting changes to the way Eures operates and how it is funded.  They propose to increase the remit of Eures to actively match jobs across the Union and EEA, to increase the funding available to Eures through changing its current funding (voted from the European Parliament) to that of the European Social Fund.The programme ‘your first Eures Job' is an initiative to promote mobility in Europe by offering ‘internship' type placements to young workers from a Member state in another Member State. DSP/Eures are currently working on this programme and hope to successfully offer placements to Irish Job Seekers in other Member States as well as positions in Ireland to a small number of Job Seekers from the other Member States.  The question of involving the Private recruitment Sector is still under discussion between the member States and the Commission.

As reflected in the commitments contained in the Programme for Government, it is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to address a number of specific issues and to make cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.In line with this rationale, the Group has been asked to examine a number of specific issues and make recommendations on these, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and any other issues that may be referred to it.The Group's method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget/estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1449	Tackling poverty and protecting the most vulnerable is a key priority for the member states of the European Union and a core element of the jobs and growth strategy set out in Europe 2020. In 2010, the EU Council of Ministers adopted an EU poverty target, with the aiming of lifting 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020.  Meeting this target requires ambitious national targets and the necessary measures to meet them.My officials and I have contributed to a number of EU considerations on the social impact of the economic and fiscal crisis. At the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council in June 2011, the Council adopted Conclusions on tackling child poverty and promoting child well-being. At the meeting, I welcomed the Council Conclusion and outlined Ireland's commitments to tackle child poverty and to support the development of a recommendation on child poverty and well-being in 2012.In October, 2011, I led the Irish delegation at the First Annual EU Convention on Poverty held in Krakow under the Polish Presidency, which was attended by some of my EU counterparts, as well as many other European stakeholders. I spoke at the opening plenary session about the challenges Ireland faces in meeting its national poverty target given the current economic and fiscal situation. The main messages from the Convention were to re-affirm the need to tackle child poverty and to promote employment as the most effective route out of poverty, despite the economic situation not being conducive to employment growth.My officials are also part of the EU Social Protection Committee which is monitoring the impact of the crisis as part of the open method of co-ordination on social protection and social inclusion. The Committee is current finalising its third report on the social impact of the crisis and the on-going fiscal consolidation. A key message from the report is the role of social protection in cushioning the impact of the economic crisis on individuals and in providing an automatic stabiliser for the economy by underpinning aggregate demand. The report shows that Ireland performs well in this regard, with social transfers reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate in 2010 from 51 per cent to 16 per cent. This represents a poverty reduction effect of 60 per cent from social transfers, one of the highest in the EU.A rapid return to economic growth and the development of inclusive labour market policies are crucial to reduce poverty and social exclusion in the EU and in Ireland. My Department will be playing a key role in this through the establishment of the National Employment and Entitlement Service which will be supporting people back into the labour market.

However, a Structures at Risk Fund was established by my Department to assist with works to safeguard structures, both in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010. This fund was administered by local authorities. I intend to provide an allocation for the Structures at Risk Fund in 2012 and I will be notifying local authorities of the details of the scheme shortly.  It should be noted that the Heritage Council also provides some funding for the protection of the built heritage.

It is the case that voluntary housing associations are currently eligible to apply for grants under Better Energy: Homes for properties in their ownership.  A number of voluntary housing associations have already availed of funding through the Better Energy: Homes scheme.

The total amount of revenue raised by the TV Licence to date in 2012 is unavailable until month end.  The 2011 Census estimated the number of occupied households to be circa 1.7 million.  A minority of these have to date made statutory declarations that they do not own a television set (approximately 44,000), which in theory leaves the potential revenue from the remainder of households to be in the region of €266m (i.e. 1.66m households x €160.00).However, the current difficult economic situation is reflected in the actual level of sales in 2011.  Final figures for 2011 show a total of 1.425m licensed households (a combination of direct sales of 1,021,443 and Department of Social Protection "free licences" of 403,815).  This final figure would have an expected revenue intake of €228m.  However, with the money being received from the Department of Social Protection in respect of free licences being capped at €57,184,565 the realised income amounted to €217.7m.  The difference between income implied by TV Licence sales in 2011 and licence fee income actually realised in 2011 is accounted for by the timing of direct debits received.In 2011, evasion was estimated to be over 15%, and thus costing upwards of €25 million.  Every effort is made by An Post to bring evaders into the licensed pool and a considerable amount of its time and resources are spent in dealing with evasion.  My Department is currently examining the latest projections for 2012 with a view to providing a revised estimate of evasion for the coming year.  In the event that the current TV Licence is replaced with another funding model, many of the issues surrounding the question of evasion will become obsolete.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1455	As the Deputy may be aware, the current TV licence system is such that, except for certain classes of social welfare recipients, if you own a television set in Ireland you are liable to pay a television licence.  An Post is currently responsible for the collection of television licence fees and for identifying those persons who have unlicensed televisions sets.The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content.  The issue of exemptions under any new Irish system is one which will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, the current list of exemptions from the TV licence is likely to continue to apply to pensioners and those people who are entitled to the Household Benefit Package.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1456	The Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act, 2010 makes provision for the safety of petroleum exploration and extraction (upstream) activities and associated infrastructure to be regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  It provides that the regulation of upstream safety will be achieved through the establishment and implementation of a new risk assessment based Framework in line with best industry practice.I understand that as part of its initial planning and scoping for the establishment of the new Safety Framework, the reports referenced by the Deputy were produced.  These reports, i.e. Report on the Existing Legislative and Regulatory Framework for Petroleum Exploration and Extraction in Ireland; and Review and Comparison of International Petroleum Safety Regulatory Regimes were undertaken by consultants GL Noble Denton on behalf of the CER.While the specifics on how unconventional gas exploration and extraction were not explicitly addressed in the above documents, neither were the specifics with regard to any other petroleum activity to be regulated by the CER.  It was never the intention I understand to cover the detail on how specific petroleum exploration and extraction activities are regulated in Ireland or the comparator countries in these reports.  The reports simply set out the broad legislative and regulatory approach to the regulation of petroleum activities, thereby providing the background information to enable the CER to begin its work on the consulting on the Petroleum Safety Framework itself.The CER published its consultation paper on the High Level Design of the Petroleum Safety Framework in August 2011, and hopes I understand, to publish its draft decision in this regard shortly.  As exploration drilling and extraction are likely to be designated by CER as petroleum activities, unconventional gas exploration and extraction would fall to be regulated under the Petroleum Safety Framework by the CER from a safety perspective.

My Department entered into a contract with 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS in late December 2008, following the conclusion of a competitive dialogue procurement process.  The objective of the NBS is to deliver broadband to certain target areas in Ireland in which broadband services were deemed to be insufficient.  Since October 2010, 3 has made broadband available in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  This includes 52 of the 149 EDs located within County Donegal.The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3 with financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  Under the NBS contract, specific service level agreement (SLA) standards are in place, which define the service and support levels to be provided by 3 to NBS subscribers.As part of this SLA, 3 has engaged a team of engineers to address NBS maintenance and service issues.  3 has confirmed that its customer and network field engineers serve the NBS areas in County Donegal, as and where required.  The provision of modem and networking devices for the delivery of the NBS is an operational matter for 3 who have confirmed that all such devices deployed in customers' premises conform to the EU Low Voltage Safety Directive insofar as safety of information technology equipment is concerned.Any NBS customer experiencing problems with the NBS service can contact3's customer care centre 24 hours a day 7 days a week by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to nbssupport@three.ie   or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.  My Department has a role when customers have fully utilised the established complaints process.  It operates a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1461	The project referred to in the Question is being held on the basis that the promoter has already received combined grant aid of €200,000 during the period 2010/2011 for other projects which is the limit of what is allowable under EU State Aid rules.State Aid refers to any aid granted by a Member State which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or goods.  EU Member States are required, under State Aid rules to submit a notification to DG Competition in the European Commission (EC) when they propose to provide state support for schemes and programmes that could be considered to distort competition in any way. Commission Regulation EC 1998/2006 allows for aid of up to €200,000, known as de minimis aid, to be provided from public funds to enterprises over a period of three years as this amount is considered too small to have an effect on economic activity between competing forces.In the original Rural Development Programme (RDP) document approved by the EC in July 2007 Ireland outlined that, as the aid to be granted under two of the Axis 3 measures of the RDP would not in any way distort competition, it would not constitute State Aid and would, therefore, not require notification to DG Competition.  The measures concerned — Basic services for the economy and rural population —€49.61m and Village Renewal and Development —€54.2mprovide support for non-commercial community based projects and focus particularly on community infrastructure.Recently Ireland was notified by the EC that only DG Competition has the competence to judge whether or not state support can be deemed to be State Aid and that a State Aid notification in the context of these two measures should have been submitted when the original programme was being prepared in 2006/2007.The notification process was not undertaken at the time of programme design and Ireland is now required to complete the notification process as soon as possible and obtain the necessary state aid clearance to proceed with projects requiring grant aid in excess of €200,000.  As the consequences of non-compliance with State Aid rules are significant, particularly for project promoters, it is necessary to suspend the allocation and approval of projects with grant amounts of over €200,000 in order to avoid non-compliance.The documentation for the State Aid notification has been submitted through the relevant EU notification systems and as soon as my Department receives the Commission decision we will notify all Local Development Companies. The project referred to in the question will be reconsidered should clearance be granted to award amounts over €200,000.

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has independently assessed the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012 indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.

I received the first five year report from the outgoing Ombudsman Commission late last year covering its activities since its establishment and this report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 11 January 2012.The role of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission as set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for an independent body with statutory functions relating to police oversight. It is vital that such a body is fully independent and I have no plans to alter this position.The Deputy has also referred to the Report of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Thomas Hammarberg who has stated that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission model "can serve as a role model for other countries".  I welcome the support of Commissioner Hammarberg for the Irish police oversight structures. He has made a small number of recommendations in relation to reducing the workload through restructuring and in relation to supervised investigations.  I will be meeting the newly appointed Ombudsman Commission within the next week and I will discuss both reports with them. On foot of that meeting, I will consider if further action is needed.

I have been informed by the Commissioner that, notwithstanding the reduction in Garda numbers, the Garda Traffic Corps, the primary role of which is roads policing, remains in place.  The strength of the Corps, as of the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 969.  All members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing criminal legislation, including the Road Traffic and Road Transports Acts and relevant regulations.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1480	The Deputy may wish to note that Part 10 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring, or tagging as it is also known, in this jurisdiction.  My predecessor made the relevant order in 2010 commencing the provisions in the context of a restriction of movement condition applying to the granting of temporary release.In tandem with the publication of the Discussion Document on the Management of Sex Offenders in 2009, a Project Board was at the time set up to examine the whole area of electronic monitoring (EM).  The Board recommended that a pilot project be initiated in order to test EM technology in this jurisdiction and assess its value for money in the management of offenders.  This recommendation was accepted and a decision was taken to explore, on a pilot basis, the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite Tracking monitoring technology on a small number of volunteer prisoners.Following a public tender competition, the Irish Prison Service tested the use of this technology on a small number of prisoners, 31 in all, who were given temporary release.  The test phase began in August 2010 and ran up until Christmas.  The group of prisoners involved were carefully selected having regard to a range of criteria including the nature of the offence, public safety and overall conduct in prison.   I am informed that prisoner compliance was high and only one prisoner was recalled due to a curfew violation.  Following the pilot project, the Irish Prison Service has undertaken a comprehensive review of its viability in the management of offenders along with a cost benefit analysis.  That review will be considered in due course.Finally, in line with the recommendations in the Report of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group, the Deputy will know that I am establishing a group to carry out an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy.  That group will also look at this issue.

The Deputy will appreciate that, given the sensitive nature of such duties, it would be inappropriate for me to give any further detail in this regard.  Furthermore, I am informed that statistics of this nature are not available prior to 2006, nor is the cost readily available.

I should also mention that the White Paper on Crime process, which is underway at the moment, has involved consultation with a wide range of interests about best practice on crime prevention.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1484	Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from An Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.As part of fulfilling its mandate the CSO publishes a range of statistics on Northern Ireland, including statistics relating to crime and justice, in cooperation with the corresponding agency in Northern Ireland.  Examples include the annual Statistical Yearbook of Ireland and Ireland North and South, a Statistical Profile.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1485	Crime prevention and reduction is a core part of the mission of An Garda Síochána.  The Force attaches great importance working in co-operation with the community, those directly affected by crime and relevant Government Department and agencies.  One example is the response of An Garda Síochána to an increase in the theft of metal, which involves targeting such crime, and burglaries and theft related crimes generally, through a number of initiatives based on collaborative effort and a targeted multi-agency response.  An Garda Síochána has established a forum involving stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers Association, the Electricity Supply Board, telecoms, transport companies, brewing concerns and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.There are dedicated Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs) within each Garda Division, who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention both the private and business community.  In addition, there are CPOs based at the National Crime Prevention Unit in Garda Headquarters.  Because Garda activity in crime prevention and reduction is part of core Garda activity, it is funded from the Garda Vote and does not have a specific financial allocation.At local level, inter-agency cooperation includes in particular the work of Joint Policing Committees, which are a forum to consult, discuss and make recommendations on policing matters arising in their area, including the prevention of crime.  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Gardaí.  Accordingly, my Department has commenced a review of how the Committees have operated since their establishment, in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities, to be followed by a broader consultation process, with the aim of seeing how their operation might be improved.  My Department is in contact with local authorities in this regard, and work on the review is ongoing.  Agencies represented on the Committees meet the costs arising from their involvement.My Department, along with the HSE, has for many years supported the work of the Community Alert programme, which is a voluntary community-based initiative in rural communities, set up in 1985 by Muintir na Tíre in association with the Garda authorities and which attaches a high priority to crime prevention and improving the security of older and vulnerable persons in the community.  In 2011 my Department provided funding of €160,000 to Community Alert.Neighbourhood Watch is a crime prevention programme which aims to enlist the active cooperation of the community in a neighbourhood, usually urban, by observing and reporting suspicious activities to An Garda Síochána.  Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch with the support of crime prevention officers and liaison Gardaí.  Garda costs related to Neighbourhood Watch are funded from the Garda Vote and do not have a specific financial allocation.Crimestoppers is a joint initiative between the Gardaí and the business community, which enables members of the public to report crime by calling a freephone number confidentially and anonymously.  Organisations and businesses provide funding.  My Department has also contributed funding to Crimestoppers, and future funding will be considered in the light of the available resources.The Probation Service works closely with other agencies of the criminal justice system on offender rehabilitation.  The Service also works in partnership with communities, local services and voluntary organisations to reduce offending and to make communities safer.  In 2011 the Service, through my Department, provided in excess of €9.5 million in funding to 48 community organisations.  The Probation Service is also represented on Local Drug Task Forces, Homeless Fora, the Parole Board, the Dublin Lord Mayor's Commission on Anti-Social Behaviour and other bodies.In line with the recommendations in the report of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group, I am establishing a group to carry out an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy.  That group will also look at the issue of support for reintegration and rehabilitation for prisoners.The Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) works with the Health Service Executive on a number of inter-agency initiatives aimed at ensuring better outcomes for children in detention, including the area of rehabilitation.  This work has been done on foot of the recommendations of the 2009 report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the Ryan Commission).The two agencies have worked together on the development of a HSE-led Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) and Forensic Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service which would be available for children in care in HSE high support, special care and in detention in the Oberstown Children Detention Schools.  It is currently expected that these initiatives will be in place by mid-2012, and they have been funded under the general allocation to the HSE for a range of child protection services on foot of the Ryan Commission report.The two agencies have also worked together on the development of a draft Protocol for Working Together between the HSE social work system and the Children Detention Schools.  This protocol will set down specific procedures and responsibilities for co-operation on the needs of children in detention who are also known to the HSE social work services.  It is expected that this Protocol will be agreed and put in place during 2012.  The draft protocol does not involve any additional funding requirements.The IYJS and HSE have also worked together in the past six months on an Aftercare Implementation Group.  The Group's remit includes the implementation of the HSE's leaving and aftercare services in relation to young people in the care of the HSE, who have served a sentence in the children detention schools.  It is expected that the Group's report, which will include consideration of funding requirements, will be made available in the near future.While generally other Departments do not have a direct role in the delivery of the crime prevention and reduction initiatives, such as the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and Garda Youth Diversion Projects, they can support them indirectly by the provision of services to children in the groups most at risk.More generally, work is underway in my Department on the development of a White Paper on Crime, following an extensive consultation process with a broad range of Governmental and non-Governmental agencies and the public.  It is intended that the White Paper will incorporate a framework National Anti-Crime Strategy, which will reflect and respond to issues raised during the consultation process, including issues relating to crime prevention and offender rehabilitation initiatives.  The White Paper on Crime is expected to be completed this year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1486	I have no plans to change the procedures already in place for considering the equality impact of legislative proposals.  When considering changes to legislation, Government Departments follow procedures outlined in the Cabinet Handbook. These require that, where proposals for legislation relate to matters on which Government policy has not already been laid down, or where they involve a new development or a material departure from existing policy, they should first be submitted to the Government by way of a memorandum for a decision in principle of the policy at issue.A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) must accompany any such memorandum seeking approval for either legislation which involves changes to the regulatory framework, or a Government Order involving changes to the regulatory framework. This Analysis includes an examination of possible impacts on poverty, gender equality, on socially excluded or vulnerable groups including people with disabilities, and on rural communities.Where no requirement for a Regulatory Impact Analysis arises, each memorandum is required to indicate clearly, as appropriate, the impact of the proposal for employment, gender equality, the impact on persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and on people with disabilities.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1487	From time to time it has been suggested that the proceeds of crime seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau should be used to fund community programmes.  It is an issue on which officials from my Department have previously consulted with the Department of Finance.  While it is accepted that there may be some symbolic value in the suggestion, it is problematic and raises a number of particular difficulties.  The Constitution requires and Government accounting principles provide that public monies be spent only as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann unless otherwise provided by statute.A policy of ring-fencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process.   Under this process, revenue which has been accumulated by the Criminal Assets Bureau is paid into the Government's Central Fund. It is this Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.  While allowing for a very small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.It could also be argued that a significant proportion of the monies secured by the Bureau are already owed to the Exchequer as it often relates to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.  There are also very practical difficulties with the proposal as the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Bureau in any given year in addition to the potential delays through the possibility of legal challenge to court disposal orders is problematic in terms of the provision of ongoing funds to community programmes.   Such a revenue source would not facilitate the proper planning of such programmes by organisations involved in the delivery of community development services.  There is also the problem of additional costs which would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert such funds to local programmes and additional administrative costs without any additional revenues being generated.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1488	While the  Deputy's question is not very clear as to what exactly the subject matter is, I am assuming that he is referring to anti-social behaviour by children. The Deputy appears to have borrowed terminology from a neighbouring jurisdiction where, I understand,  these court orders are used as part of the response to anti-social behaviour by children.   Before debating the possible benefits of procedures used elsewhere, it would be best to examine the existing procedures in Ireland with regard to anti-social behaviour by children.The Children Act 2001, as amended, provides for civil proceedings to tackle anti-social behaviour by children. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for An Garda Síochána to address anti-social behaviour by children using a behaviour warning, followed by a good-behaviour contract, followed, where appropriate, by a behaviour order. The scheme is essentially part of the process to divert children from the formal criminal justice system and the intention was that behaviour warnings or good-behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour. In the event that they fail, the next stage is to consider the admission of the child to the Garda Diversion Programme which can involve supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer. If admission to the Diversion Programme is not considered appropriate, a behaviour order may be applied for in the courts or, if criminal offences are involved, prosecution is a further option.Parents or guardians are brought into this process by An Garda Síochána at all stages. The process operates on the basis that court intervention would only be considered if the system of behaviour warnings, good behaviour contracts and the intervention of the JLO do not work.  If court intervention is deemed essential and in the event that the process results in the successful prosecution of a child, it is then open to the courts to apply various sanctions on parents or guardians as set out in Section 98 of the Children Act 2001, as amended. Where a court is satisfied that a child is guilty of an offence, it may make an order for a community sanction involving supervision by a probation officer under Section 115 of the Children Act 2001 and providing  various support options, including mentoring and access to training and education.I am not convinced that additional court orders are needed to strengthen our response to anti-social behaviour by children. However the consideration of any further measures to promote community safety and combat crime will take place in the context of the ongoing work which my Department has undertaken to produce a White Paper Crime. This has already involved a wide ranging consultation process and I have previously stated my intention that this work will support the production of a comprehensive National Anti-Crime Strategy.

The Deputy will appreciate that An Garda Síochána is involved in a wide range of initiatives to help ensure the safety of people and I will bring to its attention the matters referred to by the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1491	One of the major challenges in prisons today lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons are viewed as highly valuable commodities among elements of the prison population.  Efforts are continually made to prevent the flow of contraband into our prisons by, for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, enhanced CCTV monitoring, the stricter control of visits, and the use of prisoner and random cell searches on a daily basis.  Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and other items have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  Nevertheless, the Irish Prison Service recognises that constant improvements are required in this area.The table below illustrates the total number of items seized in each prison over this timeframe.  It is important to note that a large percentage of these seizures are not directly from prisoners but are instead retrieved at entry point or before they get to the prisoner population.  The type of articles seized vary considerably and include mobile phones, drugs, weapons (including improvised weapons such as pieces of perspex or shivs), phone chargers, alcohol, SIM cards, cash etc.  The volume of items involved and the regularity in which seizures take place highlight the continuous attempts being made by criminal elements to access prohibited articles.PrisonTotal number of items seizedArbour Hill9Castlerea Prison908Cloverhill Prison447Cork Prison514Dochas Centre261Limerick Prison1,884Loughan House585Midlands Prison1,187Mountjoy Prison4,784Portlaoise Prison385St. Patrick’s Institution1,625Shelton Abbey388Training Unit598Wheatfield Prison1,501Total15,076The above total includes 2,787 weapons and 3,156 drug seizures.

The reduction between 2010 and 2011 is a direct consequence of the introduction of enhanced security measures which include:  tighter control and monitoring of prison visits; airport style security screening of all staff and visitors coming into the prison; x-ray scanners to scan all coats and bags/briefcases; increased random searches of prisoner accommodation and it's occupants; and stricter searching of those committed to custody and of those returning to the prison after temporary release, court and after visits.No level of inter-prisoner violence is acceptable and every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  While the prison regime is designed to limit the scope of acts of violence, it is not possible to completely eliminate the possibility of such acts in prisons holding a high proportion of violent offenders without introducing a regime that would be unacceptable.  There is also a trend towards more homemade weapons being used by prisoners, for example, weapons made out of perspex, sharpened toothbrushes, a pool ball in a sock, brush handles or water jugs, since these measures were implemented.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1493	Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions including the provision of statistical information. The Deputy will also appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing as they are in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy I have made enquiries and from the statistics available, the Courts Service has informed me that 94 life sentences were imposed by the Central Criminal Court during the last five years for which annual figures are available. A detailed breakdown is set out in the table:YearMurder CasesRape CasesOtherTotal Number of Life Sentences20101620182009183122200816101720071720192006171018Total849194As the Deputy may be aware murder carries a mandatory life sentence, however, life imprisonment is also available as a sentencing option for other serious crimes such as rape.  It should be noted that a person convicted in the Central Criminal Court may obtain leave to appeal a sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It is also important to note that a sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner is subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life. Imposing multiple life sentences does not increase the severity of the sanction and has no effect in practice or law.While a prisoner who has been given a life sentence may apply for some form of temporary release to the Parole Board, should this be granted he or she remains subject to the original sentence and can be recalled to prison at any stage.  Issues such as the gravity of the crime and the danger to the public posed by the individual would obviously be taken into consideration before any decision to grant temporary release is made.  There is no automatic right to temporary release and prisoners who have committed particularly grievous crimes and continue to pose a threat can be kept in custody indefinitely.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1494	Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions including the provision of statistical information. The Deputy will  also appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing as they are in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court having considered all the circumstances of the case to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  There are a small number of situations, however, where statute has created important exceptions to this approach.  There is a strictly mandatory sentencing requirement for murder and other provisions, relating to drug trafficking and firearms offences where a mandatory minimum sentence applies.Where the court is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances which would make a particular minimum sentence unjust, a lesser sentence can be applied.  The type of circumstances which a court may consider would include whether and when the accused pleaded guilty and whether they assisted the investigation of the offence.  In the case of certain second and subsequent drug trafficking or firearms offences the mandatory minimum sentence must be applied.In order to be of assistance to the Deputy I have made enquiries and from the statistics available, the Courts Service has informed me that 84 mandatory life sentences were imposed by the Central Criminal Court during the last five years for which figures are available.  A detailed breakdown of the figures is set out in the table:YearNo. of cases where a life sentence was imposed201016200918200816200717200617Total84Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended, provides for a mandatory minimum sentence or to give it its more correct name, presumptive minimum sentence, of not less than 10 years imprisonment for certain offences. The following table provides the Deputy with a breakdown of the number of convictions under the Act in the Circuit Court,  and the number of cases where a sentence of 10 years or more was imposed during each of the last five years for which figures are available.Year*Number of Cases where a sentence of 10 years or more was imposed201036200942200837200723200610Total148*The Deputy should note that the number of cases where a sentence of 10 years or more was imposed includes cases where part of the sentence was suspended or conditions were to be met.In the case of firearm offences, the Courts Service has informed me that court statistics on presumptive minimum or mandatory minimum sentences are not maintained.  I should add that the Law Reform Commission has recently published a consultation paper on this subject.  I look forward to receiving the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in due course and those recommendations will be given full consideration.

As the Deputy has not supplied details for the second person mentioned I can only answer in the case of the person whose details have been supplied.The ‘New Immigration Regime for Full Time Non-EEA Students' was published in September 2010 and has been in operation since 1 January 2011.

In addition, there was an intake of 32 Cadets from the 2011 Cadetship competition.  The Government has decided to accept my recommendation that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force will be maintained at 9,500.  I believe that this is the optimum level required to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.  It is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue in 2012, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, so as to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1504	The proposed National Children Detention Facility (NCDF) at Oberstown, North Co Dublin is a project to accommodate young people detained by the courts on criminal charges in the children detention school setting in Oberstown, North Co Dublin operated by the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The Oberstown campus includes Oberstown Boys School, Oberstown Girls School and Trinity House School.The Government is committed to ceasing the practice of sending 16 and 17 year old boys to St Patrick's institution.  It is a priority of mine to ensure that this practice cease as soon as possible.  I visited St Patrick's Institution twice in November last year, prior to assuming legal responsibility for the children detention schools from the Minister for Justice and Equality in January 2012.  I received a briefing from the Governor and his staff on the efforts that are made on a daily basis to provide appropriate, safe and secure care fro 16 and 17 males.The Government appreciates that, as far as possible, this group is accommodated and cared for differently from the other offenders held in institution, in line with best practice and child protection guidance procedures.  Nevertheless, it is unacceptable that children continue to be detained with adult prisoners and the Government is committed to ending this practice.I am pursing both interim and medium term arrangements to address this matter.  Following visits to St. Patrick's Institution, I have asked the Irish Youth Justice Service to work with the Irish Prison Service and explore all possible interim options for the care of the boys currently there.  I expect to have a report on the matter over the coming weeks and will examine the position in conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality.I have also asked that the Irish Youth Justice Service reassess the projected cost of the Oberstown project to bring it into line with current price levels and current economic realities.  This process is ongoing and the Irish Youth Justice Service has been tasked with progressing to completion during 2012 the design work and tender documentation for the NCDF project in Oberstown.  Even when funding for the construction stage of the project is finalised, the work will still have to be completed.  I am in ongoing consultation with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the funding of the subsequent construction stage of the project.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.The management of waiting lists generally is a matter for the HSE and the individual hospitals concerned.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the Executive for direct reply.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1515	The Special Delivery Unit has a special focus on trolley issues.  During October 2011, the SDU wrote to hospitals with the highest numbers waiting on trolleys seeking proposals aimed at reducing those numbers over the critical period of November 2011 to January 2012. A range of measures were approved across 16 hospital sites and funding of €4.85 million was allocated for the purpose with strict performance criteria laid down.In addition, the SDU put in place arrangements where a staff member was on duty every day over the Christmas and New Year period with each of the 28 EDs in the country submitting update on numbers waiting three times per day. This allowed for close monitoring of hospitals at risk and facilitated quick decision making in relation to corrective action where required. This process will continue during the month of January 2012.While it is too early for complacency, the signs so far have been very encouraging with significant reductions being recorded nationally in numbers waiting each day when compared with the same period last year.  The situation will be closely monitored and the appropriate action will be taken in relation to sites at risk up to and including postponing elective surgery for a short period.The SDU focused resources on Beaumont and allocated once off funding of over €0.4m to enable it to implement the various initiatives the hospital had identified as being key to alleviating the conditions in the emergency department.  These measures included:Increasing bed capacity through the development of a 31 bedded ward encompassing transit lounge, surge capacity and streaming of delayed discharge patients.Purchasing assisted discharge care packages.Provision of rapid access nurse service on seven day a week basis.Increasing cardiology diagnostics during the week and on Saturdays to enable weekend discharge of patients.I would also like to advise the Deputy that Beaumont was successful in achieving the objective of having no one waiting over 12 months for inpatient or daycase surgery by December 31st 2011.  All except two hospitals reached this target nationally.  This work will continue in 2012 to both maintain the 12 month maximum waiting time and to further reduce waiting times by the end of  2012.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-01-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1528	I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 to 221, inclusive, together.Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 makes provision for the introduction of very specific obligations on the health services, including a statutory entitlement to:an independent assessment of health and education needs (Section 8);a statement of services (Section 11) which it is proposed to provide;an independent redress and complaints mechanism (Section 14) if required;make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer (Section 18).The Disability Appeals Officer (DAO) is an independent officer appointed by the Minister for Health whose purpose is to provide an appeals service to people who wish to appeal (i) against a finding or recommendation of a complaints officer of the HSE made under the Disability Act 2005; or (ii) against the failure of the HSE or an education service provider to implement a recommendation of a complaints officer.    The Office of the Disability Appeals Officer (ODAO) was created to support the DAO in the performance of his/her functions. It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body. Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act. From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position.  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31/12/2011 and my Department is in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post.  In the interim, a Principal Officer on my Department's staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function. A longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible.The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. Because of the reduced volume of work a decision was made to monitor the low call number for one hour per day as the volume of calls averages five per week.  The person monitoring the calls is an official from my Department, who has worked in the ODAO since 2007 and is now assigned to these duties on a part-time basis.

During my visit I was satisfied that they were very well cared for and were comfortable in their new accommodation.  Furthermore the decision to temporarily transfer them at the time to another ward in St Brendan's was made after careful clinical assessments were carried out where their individual needs were taken into account.The trainee advocate whom the Deputy is referring to here is under contract with the Irish Advocacy Network, which is a voluntary organisation that is supported and funded by the HSE to provide Peer Advocacy Services nationally.  The initial decision to terminate this person's contract and the subsequent decision to offer re-instatement were both taken independently by the Irish Advocacy Network.  The HSE did not have any involvement in those processes.  I understand that a meeting is scheduled between the HSE and the Irish Advocacy Network this Friday and I will receive a report from the HSE on the outcome of that meeting.   I will be seeking to be assured that in taking decisions such as these, appropriate procedures are used and governance arrangements apply to ensure fairness of treatment for all concerned.

My Department provides infrastructure funding for some such local authority projects under specific defined programmes.  Funding was provided to Dublin City Council, at a cost of approximately €5.5 million, for the recently completed city centre elements of the Dublin Canals Cycle route.  The route runs from Portobello to the junction of Upper Sheriff Street and the overall design envisaged a link between the S2S and Canals route on the north side of the River Liffey which may incorporate an element of redevelopment of the Royal Canal path.  The primary funding source, however, for the provision by local authorities of sustainable transport infrastructure within the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) is the National Transport Authority's (NTA) sustainability funding, and it is a matter for the NTA to prioritise and fund projects in the GDA from this allocation.

However I am advised by Dublin Bus that currently 93% of their fleet is wheelchair accessible.  The fleet will be 100% accessible following the entry into service of the next phase of replacement buses in early 2013 and for which I have allocated funds to the National Transport Authority (NTA) under my Departments Capital Programme 2012-2016.In relation to Bus Eireann I am advised that currently 59% of their total service fleet is wheelchair accessible.  With the introduction of 88 new vehicles in early 2012 and for which my Department also provided funds, total service fleet accessibility will increase to 67%.

The traditional pub is an attractive offering to visitors particularly in regard to traditional music, general entertainment, the availability of food and a general feel for the Irish culture and people.The importance of the pub is recognised in the promotional and development work of the Tourism Agencies.  For example, Fáilte Ireland has developed a Pub Accreditation Scheme to ensure that all visitors feel equally welcome when they experience Ireland and its pubs.  The quality-based approval system allows the very best of Ireland's Pubs and Licensed Premises to become accredited by Fáilte Ireland, and marketed for domestic and international visitors, regardless of their location and independent of membership of industry bodies. Participation in the scheme is voluntary.I have referred the Deputy's Question to Fáilte Ireland to enable them provide further details of the scheme to the Deputy and further details of the work it undertakes with the sector.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.
