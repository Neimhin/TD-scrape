            <p eId="para_5">The support and liaison arrangements in place for the Independent Members of Dáil Éireann who support the Government continue as before.  They operate in the context of the political agreements with these Deputies, which are confidential and based on the programme for Government, which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual estimates for capital and current expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">The only staff costs associated with the provision of this support are of an assistant principal in my Department who assists the Government Chief Whip in liaising with these Deputies.

          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_7">I accept that it is practical politics to enter into arrangements with people who wish to support the Government.  However, we do not live in a secret society and nor should that be the case.  In the midst of a national crisis and a recession, secret deals — which were hammered out between the Government and several Independent Deputies — still exist and no one can obtain details relating to them, either through freedom of information requests or by some other means.  We were originally informed that the deals concluded with three Independents in June 2007 were worth millions of euro to various constituencies.  I can neither confirm nor deny whether that is the case because I do not know the position.  The relevant information will not be provided, unless it is in the form of visible evidence of corners of pages containing the signature of the Taoiseach's predecessor.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">In light of the current national crisis and the fact that we all have ideas about how best to get the economy moving again and get people back to work, is the Taoiseach of the view that, for good or ill, it would be appropriate that details of the arrangements be published?  Is there any truth in reports which emerged in recent days to the effect that at least two of the Independent Deputies involved have indicated that some shaving has been carried out in respect of the financial arrangements and that some of the matters that were listed as priorities have now been removed?  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that is the position?  Furthermore, will he indicate whether these Independent Deputies are part of the review he is obliged to conduct with the Green Party, the Members of which are absent from the Chamber, which is holding a meeting on 18 July to decide on its priorities?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_9">As the Deputy has been aware for some time, agreements entered into by my predecessor with a number of Deputies are political in nature and details relating to them are not covered by parliamentary questions.  These agreements are confidential but, as has always been the case, they are based on the programme for Government, which incorporates the national development plan, approved Government programmes and annual Estimates for capital and current expenditure.  For some time, that has been the established position with regard to agreements with Independent Deputies.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">It is open to people to continue to make representations in respect of a range of issues and we continue to be of assistance to Deputies who support the Government regarding matters they raise.  Those Deputies entered into political agreements with my predecessor and, as stated on previous occasions, I intend to honour these.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">I cannot comment on any speculation the Deputy may have read in respect of this matter.  The issues to which I refer are dealt with on an ongoing basis with the Deputies involved on a bona fide basis.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_12">I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the exercise of government is one of openness and transparency and that matters should be seen to be absolutely above board.  I have no doubt but that this is his conviction.  However, the arrangements to which I refer are secret deals involving the Government and two or three Independent Deputies.  The details relating to these arrangements are confidential and, therefore, cannot be made known to the House or to the remainder of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">An assistant principal officer has been appointed to deal with this matter.  I do not know how much time that individual allocates to deal with the whims and concerns of the Independent Deputies involved.  How many hours per week does this official devote each week to dealing with Deputies Healy-Rae and Lowry?  How much time was allocated in respect of the concerns of Deputy Finian McGrath when he still had a deal with the Government?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_14">I am long gone out of it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_15">Is there evidence with regard to the amount of time committed, on behalf of the taxpayer, in respect of dealing with the concerns and issues raised by the relevant Independent Deputies?</p>
            <p eId="para_16">At a time when efficiency in the public services is critically important, someone who is probably an experienced assistant principal officer is obliged to spend time each week discussing with Independent Deputies confidential arrangements they have in respect of the provision of bridges, roads or developments in their constituencies and assuring them that these projects retain the priority afforded to them under the programme for Government.  That programme is in tatters because, as the Taoiseach has pointed out on numerous occasions, it was predicated on a growth rate of 4.5% and such a rate has not been maintained.  The entire programme is off the rails and that is why a review, during which Fianna Fáil and the Green Party will decide on what are their priorities, is taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">For instance, am I to take it that the confidential arrangements with Deputies Healy-Rae and Lowry will be maintained in their original form or are they to be slimmed down?  Is the aforementioned assistant principal officer to be given a new role requiring the devotion of less time to the concerns of these Deputies and more time to providing part of the efficiency of Government?  Can the Taoiseach confirm these lists costing millions, as Members have been told, will be scaled back in view of the perilous state of the economy and the difficulties everyone is experiencing at present?  Secret deals have been made in this House about which Deputy  Burton often has asked and about which she cannot be given any information.  Speaking as a public representative, it is neither here nor there whether it is the improvement of a stretch of road, the removal of a bad corner or whatever is included in these deals.  However, at a time when people demand openness, transparency and accountability, the Taoiseach sits on the Government benches while an assistant principal officer in his Department allocates time, and consequently money, to dealing with the whims of a number of Independent Deputies who support the Government when they walk through the lobbies and yet no one can find out what these agreements are about.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_18">I know this issue is a matter of some frustration to the Deputy, who raises it every week.  However, these are confidential political agreements that are in place.  As I noted, they exist within the context of the programme for Government, which in turn is in the context of the availability of resources.  All these issues must be dealt with on the basis of established priorities and the manner in which one can accommodate issues as they arise.  This requires continuing liaison with those Deputies who support the Government.  The assistant principal officer, who is attached to the Chief Whip's office, obviously is available to the Chief Whip in respect of duties there as well.  It is a question of having in place a system in which people who support the Government have an opportunity to interface with Departments and to convey their views on various matters and this is part of the job of managing the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">Moreover, all the commitments made in the programme for Government are predicated on the availability of resources and the need to accommodate priorities as we go along.  As Deputy Kenny observed, I have stated that it was predicated on growth rates of 4.5% and that progress is being made in many areas of the programme.  In any event, all commitments within the programme are predicated on that financial provision which is the centre piece of any programme for Government, namely, on the availability of resources and the maintenance of strong public finances.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_20">I refer to the case, back in the 1980s, of a Fine Gael Minister of State who had a particular policy he wished to pursue.  He approached the Taoiseach himself, only to be told that unfortunately, no money was available.  Has the aforementioned assistant principal officer ever been instructed to tell either Deputy Healy-Rae or Deputy Lowry, in respect of a particular item, that no money is available and that the item in question will drop off the end of the list?  Finally, do such agreements extend to Deputy Behan, who has left Fianna Fáil and who now also is an Independent Member?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_10">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_21">As I have stated to the Deputy, in liaising, public servants obviously will pass on whatever information or views are expressed at interface with Ministers and Departments in the normal way.  Ministers are the people who make the ultimate decisions in respect of expenditure.  That is the normal provision and there is no need to involve public servants in that process, apart from doing their job in the normal course of events.  As I noted, the agreement relates to those Deputies who support the Government and it has been open to Independent Deputies to so do.  Deputy Kenny is aware that Deputy Finian McGrath no longer seeks to support the Government on the basis of that agreement, which is fair enough.  That is the political reality with which we must deal.  However, there has been no change in respect of the Deputies who had prior agreements with us.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_11">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_22">My understanding is that in recent months, an bord snip nua has been looking at expenditure headings in all Departments.  As the Taoiseach himself acknowledged, the gross cost of the attached assistant principal officer's salary, pension entitlements and so on probably is approximately €100,000 per annum.  Even if that person devoted only 20% of his or her time to looking after the two Independent Members, one still comes out with a cost of approximately €20,000 simply to massage the Independent Members and ensure they get the news out first, even before the Government Deputies.  Has the cost of the deal and the cost of servicing the deal been examined by an bord snip nua or otherwise?  We hear that all sorts of vital areas of expenditure, some 400 areas, have been offered for review, cut back or abolition.  There is no case in a parliamentary democracy for the basis of a programme for Government being held in part in secret.  Is the expenditure involved in dealing with Independent Deputies subject to examination by an bord snip nua?</p>
            <p eId="para_23">The Taoiseach referred to the cost of the civil servant.  Three of the Deputies indicated that the value of the deal to their constituencies amounts to many tens of millions of euro.  Deputy Finian McGrath claimed to have a commitment from Government on cystic fibrosis.  This was included in the cost of his deal.  Two of the Deputies who were subject to the deal have gone because Deputy Flynn has rejoined Fianna Fáil and Deputy Finian McGrath is no longer party to the deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">In these changed financial circumstances we have an expensive administrative superstructure.  Has Mr. Colm McCarthy's group examined this?  What is the value of the deal for each of the remaining Deputies who support the Government?  The Green Party has stated, and the Taoiseach has acknowledged, that there will be a review of the programme for Government.  Will this review take into account the Independent Deputies?  Will it involve one-on-one negotiations with the Taoiseach, the Chief Whip or the assistant principal assigned to look after them?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_12">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_25">It is important that people do not involve the assistant principal, who is simply a liaison officer who deals with queries from Independent Deputies and passes them on to Departments.  There is no need to involve him in political discussions or suggest he is involved in this.  That is not his role.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">With regard to the liaison that takes place for Deputies who support the Government, per head of Dáil Members it is far less than the cost involved when we set up programme offices, programme managers and the office of the Tánaiste when the Labour Party came into office.  Per head of population that was a far more expensive support arrangement than what currently exists, which is quite frugal in comparison.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">One need not make a mountain out of a molehill.  People supporting the Government have a liaison arrangement with the Office of the Chief Whip.  The person involved is an assistant principal and liaises with the Deputies on an ongoing basis, as the Deputies require.  This is part of the management of Government to ensure we have a majority in the House to implement the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">The political agreements they have are subject to the same constraints as other spending programmes.  The committee reviewing public service numbers and programmes has examined all spending programmes.  Priorities are established, decided on and implemented by the Government.  That will apply to these matters as well.  These questions provide opportunities for Deputies to suggest something other than what is the case.  I have outlined the basic arrangement and it makes clear political sense.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I thank the Taoiseach for the reply but it does not get us much further.  If we are in a life and death situation as an economy, with all expenditure being reviewed as to whether it is absolutely critical and essential, the allocation of an assistant principal in whole or in part to mind two Independent Deputies is difficult for many ordinary people to justify when it is compared to the cutbacks that schools will experience in September.  I would not have quibbled if the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance had employed an adviser or two to keep an eye on the banks because we might not be in the mess we are if, during his stewardship of the Department of Finance——</p>

Obviously, the issue of public service numbers is being reviewed and examined departmentally.  The point returns to the basic issue.  This is a political arrangement the Government has undertaken with those who support it on the Independent benches in the interests of ensuring that we accommodate views where possible, listen to their priorities and see in what way their issues can be advanced.  Many of these issues are of concern to all those who represent these constituencies.  There is nothing unusual about this and it is important from our point of view to accommodate in that respect, rather than not having any liaison arrangements whatever, in an effort to show our bona fides towards the issues they would raise on the basis that they are supporting the Government.  It is an arrangement that is totally defensible in that context.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_41">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">My most recent contacts with the British Prime Minister were on the Lisbon treaty and discussions which took place at the recent European Council meeting on which I have already reported to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">I last met with the Northern Ireland political parties at the eighth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council which took place yesterday at Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park.  The meeting was attended by the First Minister, Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, as well as a range of Government Ministers and Ministers from the Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">At the meeting we had positive and constructive exchanges across the full range of agenda items.  We had a broad discussion of the economic challenges facing the island and our respective responses to dealing with the downturn and its impact, particularly on the banking sectors in both jurisdictions.  We outlined our Government's intention to establish a National Asset Management Agency and it was agreed that there would be an early meeting of the two Finance Ministers to discuss those issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">The council noted the contribution of continuing practical and mutually beneficial North-South co-operation to assisting both Administrations in their efforts to promote growth and employment; the contribution that the all-island economy can make and how we can work together to provide better and more efficient public services North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">We noted progress on the A5 and A8 roads projects and agreed procedures governing payment of the Irish Government contribution.  In accordance with this, payment of €9 million will be made by the Minister for Transport to the Northern Ireland consolidated fund before the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">The council also confirmed its intention to conclude the St. Andrew's review process before the end of 2009 and it instructed the review group to accelerate its work on all the elements of the review and to provide a final report at the next meeting of the plenary session.  In addition, the meeting welcomed recent North-South co-operation on matters such as the swine flu outbreak and cross-Border arrangements for the removal of illegally dumped waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">Overall, there have been some positive developments in Northern Ireland.  I believe that the time is right to complete the process of the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Executive.  I am encouraged by the comments of the First Minister that discussions on the financial arrangements to allow this are making progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">I would also like to welcome the recent announcements made by the loyalist organisations on decommissioning.  Both Governments have always been firm in our demand that all weapons on all sides should be decommissioned.  We also welcome the moves that the loyalist organisations have been making in recent years to move on.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_22">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_50">Has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to address, with the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the British Prime Minister, the importance of moving on with the proposal to move policing and justice powers from London to Belfast?  Does he agree this is long overdue and is essential as an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement and all that was promised therein?  Does he also agree that for the new dispensation to function in the North, we need to see a new beginning to policing and justice?  Therefore, will the Taoiseach undertake to renew his efforts to encourage all concerned to move quickly to put policing and justice firmly in place in Belfast?</p>
            <p eId="para_51">I note from various print media this morning the progress reported from yesterday's all-Ireland ministerial council meeting with regard to a number of projects.  I have questions with regard to a number of those projects — outworkings of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement — including the A5 which joins up with the N2 on this side of the Border and which will complete the Dublin-Derry-Donegal connections.  The Taoiseach stated that confirmation of the expected routes would be announced shortly.  Can he be more specific as to when we will have the detail?  When does he expect this will be announced?</p>
            <p eId="para_52">With regard to two further elements to which reference was made, was there any progress on the Ulster canal project?  Can the Taoiseach give us an indication of the current status and the intention of both Administrations for this flagship project which is of tremendous importance and which has the potential to bring about significant economic rejuvenation of the Border counties, North and South?  Also, with regard to the Government's withdrawal of funding from the all-Ireland autism centre for excellence at Middletown in County Armagh, a joint North-South project, is there any change in the Government's position with regard to the indication by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, of a withdrawal of funding already committed for the development of that centre this year?  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Government will restore its joint commitment to the development of that important project for children with autism on this island?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_23">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_53">On policing, I understand the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will have a further meeting next week with the British Prime Minister on the matter.  There are financial arrangements and implications with regard to the decision and it is necessary to address those issues as part of the process that has been agreed for the transfer of devolved powers of policing and justice to Northern Ireland as soon as possible.  There is significant work going on in that respect.  It is important the issue is dealt with in that context as that is where the issue stands currently.  We support and encourage a speedy resolution of these issues so that matters can move on more quickly towards the ultimate objective agreed by all, namely, that there should be devolved powers of policing and justice to Northern Ireland.  This important part of the process needs to be completed as soon as possible in the interest of stability and wider ownership by everybody of the process itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">On the question of the A5, we have seen agreement on preferred routes recently and there has been significant work done between the roads authority in Northern Ireland and the National Roads Authority here.  I understand both sides are happy with the level of progress that has been made by their respective roads authorities on the issue.  We are ready to move to the next stage soon. I understand the Minister for Transport and his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive will meet to discuss the rate of progress shortly, as soon as the next arrangements are made for a meeting.  On both sides, happiness was expressed at the progress that has been made in regard to that major project.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">With regard to the Ulster Canal, the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, has made arrangements for a meeting with his new counterpart, Mr. McCausland, in a matter of weeks, at which that issue will continue to be discussed to see whether it can be progressed.  I have not got the up-to-date position on the Middletown situation but I will have the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, convey it to the Deputy.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_24">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_56">I thank the Taoiseach for his responses.  In regard to the A5-N2, there remains an amount of confusion in regard to the intentions concerning the development on this side of the Border — that element within County Monaghan from Clontibret to the Border at or near Aughnacloy.  In the absence of the Taoiseach's ability to answer the question directly today, is it possible he would ask that clarification be forwarded to me?  There is great concern that this will not be an A5-N2 but an A5 only, which would be a mistake with serious consequences.  We definitely need to see that joined up and properly considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">With regard to the earlier questions on the Middletown project, while I welcome that the Taoiseach will have an update transmitted to me, there is a tremendous concern among families and the organisations which represent families with children on the autism spectrum as to the Government's intentions <i>vis-à-vis</i> this project.  This was jointly announced by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, and the then Minister for Education, Mr. Martin McGuinness.  Can the Taoiseach give an indication that he is working towards restoring the commitment that existed up to recently and that the proposed development at that site in the current year can proceed unhindered and without delay?</p>
            <p eId="para_58">I note discussions are to be held between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the newly appointed Minister north of the Border, Mr. Sammy Wilson, on the implications of NAMA for the Six Counties.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what format that engagement will take?  What are the expectations of the impact of the advent of NAMA north of the Border?  With legislation to come here, will due consideration be given to any impact north of the Border in the legislative preparation here?  Will legislation be required in the Executive to mirror that effect and has this been considered?  Can the Taoiseach give us some sense of the position?</p>
            <p eId="para_59">Finally, it is appropriate that we would record a united rejection of the outrageous treatment meted out to non-national residents within the Belfast area recently.  I speak specifically of people from the Roma and Romanian backgrounds who have been subjected to very severe attacks, a significant number of whom have left our shores as a result.  Can we unite in agreed rejection of these outrageous racist acts?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_61">I do not have the technical detail on the A5 to hand.  The National Roads Authority is more specifically the body involved as these are technical engineering issues.  I know issues are being raised by Deputies in the area and I can get an update in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">On the question of what will happen in Middletown, I ask the Deputy to accept I will have the Minister set out the up-to-date position.  I cannot recommit to anything unless and until we see in what way that project will evolve.  There were certain ideas at the time and discussions had taken place as to how Middletown would be used in the context of the provision of services in this area, and this is still under consideration.  We have to work this out in detail as we go along but it is best that the Deputy would await a considered reply from the Minister as to the accurate, up-to-date position.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">The question of the agreement to meet, made between the Minister for Finance and the Finance Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, arose from a briefing by the Minister for Finance at a meeting in respect of the National Asset Management Agency and the role it will play in helping us to restructure the banking industry, provide long-term liquidity and more easily accessible credit to Irish business generally by way of bringing distressed assets under the aegis of the agency.  The Northern Ireland First Minister would have referred to the role the Executive has played in respect of identifying assets for possible disposal for use subsequently in the social housing area within Northern Ireland in terms of a policy objective it has identified.  The need for practical co-operation is emphasised when one considers the two policy objectives we have.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">All the activities of the National Asset Management Agency will be based upon purely commercial criteria.  It is not envisaged that there would be a fire sale of all assets that come under the aegis of the agency.  The idea is to put those on a longer time horizon such that we can recover value in respect of those assets the current value of which, because of present market failure or depression, does not correspond to the acquired value of the assets in recent times.  The reason behind the asset management agency concept in the first place is the need to find a longer time horizon in which to recover asset values in a way that could not be carried by private financial institutions and which must meet current market disciplines and at the same time make sufficient provision for bad or doubtful debt in the future.  Without going into the detail, that was all mentioned and explained by the Minister for Finance.  The meeting of finance ministers was to ensure the provision of a briefing by the Minister for Finance on a confidential basis for his colleagues in the North, that they understand and know not only the concept but the way in which the proposal would be implemented and applied, to keep them apprised of the issue so that they can understand in terms of their policy approach and know what it is that we must achieve as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">Assets are located in Northern Ireland that would come under the aegis of the National Asset Management Agency and the Executive would like to be apprised generally about the impact or otherwise the proposal would have on the property market as it evolves in the coming months and years as well.  It is entirely legitimate and a meeting and briefing between Ministers is an obvious way of clearing lines in respect of how things will progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">On the issue of racism, we all deplore any acts of violence or intimidation against anyone, particularly where there are racist overtones.  It was pointed out at the meeting on the Northern Ireland Executive side that while that matter, rightly, received a good deal of press and media coverage, including the utter condemnation by everyone against the acts, it was also highlighted that there are many good things happening within communities in efforts to integrate non-nationals into Northern Ireland society and that this should be highlighted to enable a full and rounded picture to emerge.  Without in any way justifying unacceptable racist activities or occurrences there are many things taking place which are a good deal more positive in nature which should be emphasised.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_27">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_67">I refer to the briefing by the Minister for Finance in respect of NAMA.  Remarks are attributed to the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, in respect of NAMA and the way in which it would operate.  He indicated his fears that assets, which would be presumably covered by Irish banks and, therefore, part of the NAMA process, might be put for sale on the market and sold off cheaply.  His major concern appeared to be that this would impact negatively on the Northern Ireland property market.  I refer to the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Deaglán de Bréadún.  Is the impact on the property market in Northern Ireland now a factor in respect of NAMA valuations?  Judging by what the First Minister was saying, they would like to keep asset valuations high so as to prevent the property market dipping down further.  This would imply that the taxpayer in the South would have to take those assets at an artificially high valuation because it does not sound like the value would be marked to market or anywhere near it.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">Is this issue of the Northern Ireland property market now a major factor in the approach to the valuation of assets in the NAMA process?  This would appear to be so from the report in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I am surprised that the discussion centred around the real economy and Main Street, rather than the property market and jobs because it is the restoration of jobs, sustaining employment and battling unemployment that I would have thought was the most important issue for Ireland, North and South.  Are the comments attributed to the First Minister, Mr. Robinson——</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I welcome the announcement by the UDA and the UVF of demilitarisation and the decommissioning of weapons.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach a few straightforward questions.  The Minister for Finance said that he made a mistake in increasing the VAT rate.  The real issue in respect of the difference in costs between the North and South was in the main due to the differential between sterling and the euro.  The perception among people in the Republic was that because of a reduction in VAT in Britain and Northern Ireland and an increase here, there were real bargains to be had and more than €700 million was spent north of the Border.  Was this matter discussed yesterday and was there any indication that the Minister for Finance intends to reverse that decision?</p>
            <p eId="para_72">In respect of climate change and energy, what is the position regarding the North-South interconnector?  There is a problem from the midlands to the Border.  Was this matter discussed between the Government and its Northern Ireland counterparts?</p>
            <p eId="para_73">Was there any discussion about the appointment of the North-South Parliamentary Body which is part of the Good Friday Agreement structure?  It is high time there was a move on this.  People in all parties here have an interest in seeing that we move on to build more completely on the Good Friday Agreement.  Was there any discussion or timescale agreed?</p>
            <p eId="para_74">In April last year the Taoiseach indicated that it would be in order for companies operating in the IFSC to set up offices in the North to deal with a skills shortage in the Republic.  He estimated at that time there could have been 3,000 to 5,000 jobs created in Northern Ireland.  Was this matter discussed at the ministerial meeting yesterday?  Has there been any progress on this matter or has it been decided that as a result of the conditions applying now it might be better and in everyone's interest to have as many jobs as possible created here?  Was this discussed?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_31">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_75">The general economic situation was discussed and it was in this context that the issue of NAMA arose.  It was part of the discussion.  I emphasise to Deputy Burton that her surmise regarding comments attributed to the First Minster is not correct.  I am sure the First Minister was accurately quoted about his various concerns and I explained in a previous reply the context in which those concerns were expressed.  I also made the point that commercial criteria apply in respect of the National Asset Management Agency.  There is no differentiated approach with regard to how assets are valued.  The question of valuation methodology must be approved by the European Commission in any event so there is no question of that arising at all.  These matters will all be dealt with consistently.  They are taken on a case by case basis but it is not a question of the National Asset Management Agency acquiring assets for the purpose of immediate disposal.  It is a question of providing, in the main, a longer time horizon to allow asset value recover rather than immediate disposal of assets.  That is the reason a briefing by the Minister for Finance with his counterpart in the North would be useful in that respect so that they will have a full understanding and view of what is involved and get a detailed assessment from us.  It was in that context that the meeting was arranged.  There is no change from what is envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">Regarding what Deputy Kenny said, the question of volatility of exchange rates between sterling and the euro is not something under the direct control of this Government.  The whole purpose of the North-South agenda is the long-term issues.  In what way can we provide building blocks that will make the island economy more competitive?  In what way can we bring the island economy to the fore?  In what way can we identify practical areas of co-operation across a range of areas, not only those set out originally?  The whole idea of the interaction at ministerial level and in plenary format is as a confidence building measure so that both sides see the value of that co-operation and the need to explore its potential.  In particular, in the context of the changed economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, a strong point I will be making is that now, more than ever, the need for close interaction and co-operation between North and South is important in the context of hard-pressed taxpayers in both jurisdictions providing moneys and trying to maintain service levels of public services.  At the same time there is a need to see in what way we can co-operate and avoid duplication.  This is an agenda that is all the more important and emphatic now than was the case before this, indeed more so.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">In the context of working through financial services, the purpose in that regard was the mix and match approach.  There are parts of the financial services industry in which we are well established, and there are very well paid jobs available here.  There are other aspects of the financial services industry where we are no longer competitive but in which the Northern Ireland area might be competitive.  Why would we not work together to try to ensure we maximise the island-wide approach?  That is what co-operation is about.</p>

        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if she will make a statement on the proposed job subsidy scheme which is proposed to form part of the national recovery plan; the types of companies to which it will apply; and the way it will be funded.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_32">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_80">The Government is working on the detail of a temporary employment subsidy scheme, the purpose of which will be to help the economy retain its productive capacity and help employers to retain the labour, knowledge and skills of the workforce, thereby supporting a faster return to sustainable growth; help employees to retain their jobs; and ensure that economic and fiscal stability is promoted by avoiding the costs of unemployment, including statutory redundancy payments and the longer-term cost of social welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">It is proposed the scheme will involve paying a subsidy to firms to retain a person in employment who may otherwise have been made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">The scheme is intended to apply to companies in the manufacturing or internationally traded service sectors that are currently engaged in exporting.  In addition, in order to qualify for support it is intended that a company must not have been in difficulty on 1 July 2008, and a financial assessment must establish that it is now facing such difficulties as a result of the global and financial economic crisis that redundancies are likely to have to be considered within 12 months.  It is also intended that a company must also be judged to be viable and capable of growth in the medium term to receive support under the scheme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_83">I thank the Tánaiste for her answer.  I have a number of questions, my first being whether the Tánaiste would be prepared to publish the draft proposal she is making.  I have heard it talked about in this House, by Ministers and the Taoiseach in the media, and we know it is being discussed with the social partners.  It is certainly being discussed in the media as well.  It would be appropriate at this stage and would show respect for the House and for the Opposition if the Minister were prepared to publish the draft of her proposal so that we may all see what is proposed and the potential consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">How will the Tánaiste assess which employees would "otherwise be made redundant"?  An employment subsidy regime can have a huge deadweight effect if it subsidises jobs which are not in danger.  In such cases there is cost to the taxpayer but no jobs are saved.  There is also the danger that subsidising a business which is in trouble will simply displace jobs from another business which may be equally in need of subsidy.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">I will not be in a position to publish the draft proposals as I must first bring them to my Government colleagues.  They will then be made available to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">It is proposed that the scheme will be administered by Enterprise Ireland, which has considerable experience of the stabilisation fund and the criteria set down for it, which are deemed appropriate.  Those criteria will deal with the issue of deadweight, to which Deputy Varadkar has referred.  It is not my intention that companies in the scheme will not be viable.  Qualification will be based on viability and on opportunities, particularly for exporting, which will be available to these companies when the market returns to where it needs to be.  The assessment will be based on the criteria set down by Enterprise Ireland and by agreement with a national monitoring committee, which will be set up to assure taxpayers and the people involved in the scheme that it will be working and that it is the right thing to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">It is interesting that the Tánaiste referred to the enterprise stabilisation fund.  The proposal, as she outlines it, is similar and will assist the same sort of companies as are already assisted by the enterprise stabilisation fund.  That fund is only barely in existence and it is too soon to know whether or not it is effective.  I am concerned that the Government is basing a new scheme on one which is only a few months old.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">I understand the new scheme will cost approximately €250 million, coming from the surplus in the training levy fund, and will only benefit exporters in the manufacturing or internationally traded sectors.  Given that the scheme is restricted to that sector, only a small number of workers will benefit from it.  People in construction, services, retail and other sectors will not benefit.  Only a small number of business and workers will benefit but all workers and businesses will have to pay.  Could that €250 million not be more effectively used to do some of the things Fine Gael has proposed, such as reducing both rates of VAT, abolishing the travel tax and introducing an exemption from employers' PRSI for employers who take on new staff?  Such a measure would benefit all businesses, consumers and workers and would save more jobs.  The Government's targeted subsidy approach will only benefit a small select area.</p>

Pilot schemes such as the graduate placement programme and the training initiative for people in part-time work, which was proposed by the Labour Party, need to be evaluated.  I hope they will prove successful.  I also hope the new job subsidy scheme will work.  The feedback from the stabilisation fund has been nothing but positive.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_41">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_95">I am aware of various surveys carried out by ISME.  The results of individual surveys from the enterprise and banking sectors can be useful in highlighting the generality of the credit supply issue but they must all be examined in the context in which they are carried out and the methodologies applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">The banks' recapitalisation package was about securing the long-term health of the economy and about enabling our banks to get back to the business of lending to viable projects and about saving jobs. The package includes many supports for small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.  This should ensure that sound businesses will receive support from their banks.  A €100 million environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15 million each to new or existing seed capital funds.  Much of this funding will flow to small and medium enterprises.  SMEs are also covered by the code of conduct on business lending to SMEs.  This code which was published by the Financial Regulator came into effect from 13 March 2009.  The application of the code will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.  Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will also provide funding for SMEs on foot of €300 million facilities provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">The recapitalised banks agreed to pay for and co-operate with the carrying out of an independent review of bank lending to SMEs.  Additional banks have now participated in this review with the result that the five major lending banks are now included.  The purpose of the review is to ascertain the position on credit availability to SMEs here and to recommend appropriate action to improve credit availability.  The independent review has now been submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and will be published shortly.  I welcome the completion of this review as it should allow all stakeholders an objective view of the state of lending from the banks to SMEs and provide some clarity on the level of credit being declined.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">Arising from the recapitalisation package, the Tánaiste, along with my colleague the Minister for Finance, also established a credit supply clearing group with bank, business (including ISME and SFA) and State representation.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">This group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.  The group is, however, not an appeals mechanism for cases where credit has been refused by the banks.  Individual business decisions remain the responsibility of the banks.  The credit supply clearing group is being chaired by my Department and will work to provide a clear picture of any emerging lending patterns while facilitating direct discussion by all the relevant interests in addressing problems.  The group met for the first time on 28 May 2009 and will meet again shortly following the publication of the independent review of bank credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">To assist and complement the work of the credit supply clearing group, I have held seven regional meetings, beginning in Cork on Monday 29 June, to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the State sector, their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level.  I have, to date, held  meetings in Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Bundoran, Shannon, Galway and Athlone.  The last meeting will be held in Dundalk on Monday next 13 July.  In the course of these meetings I met with local representatives of the major banks, business representatives from local chambers of commerce, ISME, SFA, IFA and the Irish Hotels Federation.  Local representatives from the various State agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, city and county enterprise boards and Fáilte Ireland, also attended.  The outcome of these meetings should facilitate a greater understanding of the issue at both regional and national levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">Outside of the banking sphere, my Department's continuous support for enterprises arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county and city enterprise boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009 for the development agencies ensures that we can continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">The Department has also introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Departments to their business suppliers from 30 to 15 calendar days.  This commitment has effect on all valid invoices received on and from 15 June 2009 and should help ease cash flow difficulties for SMEs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_104">The Minister of State will note that the focus of this question is jobs.  It is important that money flows to create new jobs and to sustain and retain existing jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">Ordinary people and owners of small businesses are saying banks are running rings round the Government.  They got huge funding for recapitalisation with no lending conditions attached.  There is a credit famine which knows no bounds.  Overdraft facilities are being withdrawn or renegotiated, loans are not being given or are given with huge conditions attached.  Additional security is demanded and punitive charges imposed.  Is the Minister of State concerned that banks are refusing to lend to 50% of small firm applicants and of the impact this credit famine is having on small businesses?</p>
            <p eId="para_106">The Minister of State and the Tánaiste doubted the ISME survey.  I will bring them up to date.  Does the Minister of State also doubt the county enterprise survey?  Mr. Michael Tunney, chairperson of the CEB network says, "If the situation continues many good businesses will be forced to close as a result".</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The number in receivership in the first half of the year has quadrupled.  Some 523 companies are involved in liquidation, the highest since records began.  Business closures outnumber formations for the first time since 2003.  The Minister of State may doubt the ISME survey.  Does he also doubt the county and city enterprise boards, which relay these figures to the Minister of State's Department?</p>
            <p eId="para_108">The Minister of State launched a credit evaluation programme in Cork on 29 June.  What did he hear from that programme which is inconsistent with what ISME and the CEB is telling him?  What is going on?  Why will the Minister of State not tell banks to release credit to businesses which need it?</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_109">I am well aware of the survey.  Mr. Mark Fielding, CEO of ISME attended one of the seminars I held in Dublin to discuss the whole issue.  I have also met the county enterprise boards and chambers of commerce throughout the country.  We invited regional bank representatives and the representatives of broader industry from farming to the chambers of commerce to the seven meetings to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">I have an in-depth knowledge of the difficulties facing small and medium-sized businesses, SMEs, but we must put such matters in context.  The most important decision to provide credit to SMEs was the bank guarantee of 30 September 2008, which was intended to stabilise financial institutions.  Subsequently, we recapitalised the two main banks and nationalised Anglo Irish Bank.  In light of the recapitalisation, we introduced a code of conduct in respect of lending to SMEs whereby the banks are obliged to have a capacity 10% greater than their 2008 lending figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">We are conscious of the SMEs' difficulties in accessing credit, but there is a fundamental issue that we should discuss at a later date, that is, normal lending practices stopped some years ago.  This is a fact.  Credit was generously and easily handed out.  SMEs must now submit projections and cash flow plans whereas submitting audited accounts to managers used to be sufficient to receive extra credit facilities.  There is a tightening, but we must ensure we can wean the country from excessive lending practices to sustainable practices and that, in the meantime, SMEs are not hurt.  With most of these exercises, the Government and every Deputy present have one purpose in mind, that is, the retention and protection of jobs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_112">Absolutely.  We can concur on that objective, but I want to ask a related question.  Into what black hole did the €350 million that was to be made available by the European Investment Bank, EIB, disappear?  It does not appear to be going where it was intended or was Mr. Fielding out of date when he stated that some banks were ignoring EIB funds for SMEs, that two thirds of bank staff had no knowledge of those funds and that many of them did not know what was the SME lending code?  Are the rescued banks snubbing the Government?  Now that they have the capital, are they trying to run the show their way on the basis that, even though the State was fairly good to them, that was nine months ago whereas they are now where they want to be and will tighten up the rules, thereby letting businesses go to the wall?</p>
            <p eId="para_113">This is a matter of jobs.  Thousands of jobs are being lost in the retail, manufacturing and technology sectors.  Every sector, including hotels, is being hit by this situation.  Why are the banks not lending the promised €350 million to SMEs at reduced interest rates?</p>

            <p eId="para_114">As I stated at the outset, ISME's survey was useful in that context.  Mr. Fielding raised this issue at one of our seminars and the banks gave an undertaking they would re-advertise through their staff or inform their staff of the importance of the EIB's funding.  The major banks have drawn down the funding.  It is not for normal credit and short-term working capital, as criteria apply.  It is for long-term working capital and liquidity purposes.  The major banks were in discussions with the EIB.  At a fine meeting this morning in Athlone in the Deputy's county, I met some people who spoke highly of him——</p>

            <p eId="para_120">The proportion of students studying science and mathematics at junior and leaving certificate levels has been stable since 2001 and Ireland ranks as one of the leading countries in the European Union in terms of science, mathematics and computing graduates.  However, in terms of engineering graduates, Ireland is ranked well below the EU 15 average.  This is a direct consequence of the prominence within Ireland's higher education system of science compared to engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">The National Skills Bulletin 2009 published last Friday by the <i> </i>Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, EGFSN, concluded that skill shortages persist within the economy and have been identified in the specialised high-skill areas of IT, science, sales-marketing, health, accountancy, engineering and management.  Demand is confined to those with third level qualifications and with specific expertise and experience.  For example, companies are still finding it difficult to source advanced IT system management skills, experienced engineers for the development and implementation of lean manufacturing processes and scientific technicians for the development and prototyping of specific medical devices.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Government employment permit policy is to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the EU.  Employment permits will issue only in respect of non-EEA citizens on a vacancy specific basis where skills or labour shortages in areas strategic to the economy exist.  The majority of employment permits in strategic high-skill areas are facilitated by way of our green card permit scheme.  Green cards may issue in respect of vacancies where the salary on offer is at least €60,000 per annum or in respect of any occupation where the salary is in excess of €30,000 per annum provided that occupation is listed on a green card occupation list maintained by the Department.  This list of occupations eligible for a green card has been recently reduced to reflect labour market conditions.  The main categories are IT, health care, industry, education and finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">In addition, the researcher mobility hosting agreement scheme, which provides for the entry into the State of researchers from third countries under Council Directive 2005/71/EC, has been operating successfully since 2007 with some 570 hosting agreements issued to researchers, representing more than 59 nationalities.  Some 18 third level institutes and one private enterprise have been accredited to issue hosting agreements under the scheme.  In addition, a hosting agreement extranet was established enabling relevant key departments, such as immigration authorities, embassies and consulates, access to an electronic database, thus expediting immigration procedures for third country researchers.  Under both of the above schemes, the person will be allowed fast-track access to the long-term residence status to be provided under the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I thank the Minister of State for his response and compliment the steps taken to fast-track specific positions.  I wish to flag an issue, namely, a comparison in the recently published Quarterly National Household Survey, which showed a decrease of 9,000 Irish nationals employed in the professional, scientific and technical sectors up to the end of the first quarter of 2009.  During the same period, the number of employees from the EU 14 countries and third countries increased by 2,000 and 1,000, respectively.  It would be worrying were this trend to continue, given the Government's planned significant investment in the smart economy and the Minister of State's comments last week to the effect that €100 million in EU research funding is entering Ireland per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">The concern is that we are not producing graduates to a high enough standard to fulfil the roles being created.  We must address this concern in terms of our education system and its focus on maths.  The Minister for Education and Science has suggested a loan scheme for third level students.  Elsewhere, this has been shown to force many people with technical skills out of their countries.  Has the potential impact on retaining such skills been evaluated?</p>

            <p eId="para_126">The Quarterly National Household Survey is an interesting reflection of what is occurring in the labour market, but we can do nothing about the 2,000 people from the EU.  If 1,000 people from outside the EU are securing jobs in the categories in question, we must examine the matter, but there are schemes whereby third country nationals can enter Ireland where——</p>

Obviously, a stringent test is applied to employers who make this case.  It is not true that employers can lightly invoke the reason of skill shortages.  Rather, they must rigorously prove that an appropriate person is not available or cannot be accessed within the domestic or EEA labour market.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_59" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_135">My Department and I closely monitor the operation of FÁS and the implementation of its labour market programmes.  The medium-term policy direction of FÁS is set out in its multi-annual statement of strategy, which is developed in close co-operation with officials in my Department.  Overall responsibility for the management of FÁS lies with its board.  Its internal governance structures include an executive board comprising the director general and seven assistant directors general.  The executive board reports to the senior board.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">Senior officials from my Department meet senior executives in FÁS on a regular basis to maintain the alignment of Government policy with programme delivery.  In addition, a senior official from my Department is a member of the board of FÁS.  The budget for FÁS is agreed on the basis of detailed discussions between FÁS, my Department and the Department of Finance in the context of the annual Estimates process.  The allocation of funding to FÁS is aligned to Government policy in the context of the provision of active labour market supports to meet the changing needs of the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">The annual financial accounts of FÁS are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These accounts include a number of statements relating to financial compliance, which form part of the FÁS annual report and, in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Services Act 1987, are presented to me by FÁS and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">When issues of concern relating to expenditure in FÁS were brought to my attention following my appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year, I acted quickly to seek assurances from FÁS that the issues highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report had been addressed.   I then proceeded to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out an examination of the activities of the FÁS corporate affairs division since 2000 and to report on the effectiveness of management and control systems across the FÁS organisation.  I have recently received a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General that deals with the examination of advertising and promotion in FÁS and it forms part of this investigation.  This report will be laid before the House in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">In addition, my Department is currently carrying out a review into the active labour market programmes funded by my Department, including those delivered by FÁS.  The review focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of these programmes in the context of current labour market policy changes and challenges.  The review will draw conclusions on the balance of resources and the rationale for the allocation of public funding in the context of current and future labour market policy challenges, including the implementation of the national skills strategy. It is expected that these conclusions will inform policy decisions on the allocation of funding in the context of the Estimates campaigns of 2010 and future years.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">The FÁS Science Challenge programme was established in 2003 and was described as being part of the Government's effort to promote science, engineering and ICT.  Another programme, Discover Science and Engineering, was also established in 2003 with the objective of promoting awareness of science and engineering.  Science Foundation Ireland was established formally in 2003 and has a similar remit.  It was recently brought to our attention that the FÁS Science Challenge programme was investigated on the initiative of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and abandoned.  An official of Science Foundation Ireland stated the programme was characterised by a lack of data on objectives and what was intended to be delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">We had better differentiate between the FÁS programme and that of Science Foundation Ireland.  The latter has been absolutely superb, not without the Minister of State and me keeping a cute eye on expenditure and determining where commercialisation opportunities arise.  Our focus is certainly on enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">The Science Challenge programme was established to encourage education and research and, eventually, high-level careers in science, engineering and technology.  This is what we wanted but, unfortunately, on the basis of expenditure, value for money analysis and outputs, I felt the programme needed to be reappraised.  On receiving the result of the reappraisal on my behalf by the Department, FÁS, Forfás and Science Foundation Ireland and senior officials from the Higher Education Authority, I decided immediately that although the programme was beneficial in one way, it certainly did not work within the remit of FÁS and was not good value for money.  It is on this basis that I decided not to continue with the programme.  I have instructed my officials to secure the orderly wind-down of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">There are a number of initiatives, contacts and opportunities within the programme that can be availed of by people such as Professor Frank Gannon of Science Foundation Ireland with a view to considering other types of opportunities.  In the context of the challenges that arise at present, FÁS would be best to focus on the unemployed.  We must continue to train those who are employed to increase productivity.  I decided on the basis of the views brought to my attention that we would not proceed with the programme.</p>

The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out an investigation on my behalf in consultation with the Committee of Public Accounts and a further investigation will be carried out.

         the average time taken by her to pay out redundancy payments upon receipt of an application for support; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_68" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_153">The considerable increase in the number of redundancy payment claims lodged with the redundancy payments section of my Department in the latter part of 2008, and to date in 2009, is unprecedented and is giving rise to delays in the processing of redundancy payments for individuals and companies within acceptable timeframes.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics for the first half of 2009, which indicate that the number of new claims lodged with my Department stands at 42,724, an increase of 160% over the equivalent period last year.  Moreover, claims lodged at this half-year point now exceed the total number of claims received for the full year 2008, which, of itself, was an exceptional year by comparison with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000 or less.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">I am acutely aware of the difficulties the inability to deliver an acceptable turnaround of redundancy rebate payments is giving rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Together, we have taken and continue to take all possible steps to address the issues.  Measures already taken include the reassignment of 19.7 additional staff, full-time equivalents, from other areas of the Department to the redundancy payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands; the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in redundancy payments section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and co-operation of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA; and the provision of better quality information on current processing times on the Department's website.  This enables the staff in the redundancy payments area to concentrate on and prioritise the processing of redundancy payment claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">The average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed on-line is six months while claims submitted by post take seven months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where the employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time, assuming all of the necessary supporting documentation is filed, is between six and eight weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">I agree with the Deputy that this is totally unacceptable and that is why I have streamlined a transfer of my human resources, and, to the disgruntlement of every member of my staff all of my overtime budget, to deal with this inordinate difficulty.  I appreciate that it is not good enough and we will do all that we can to correct this as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">I accept why there is a problem.  Allocating 19 extra staff is a good move but the figures have been very high for the past six months and will unfortunately be just as high if not higher for the next six months.  Can anything else be done to reduce those waiting times?  The Minister has said that a six or seven month wait is not acceptable.  It is a massive jump from six weeks and is not good enough.  We know that businesses are under great pressure.  They cannot get money from banks or from their customers or even from the Department.  The small sums, €1,000, €2,000 or €3,000, are a great deal of money.  They need that just to pay some of the bills each week.  It is very serious.  Does the Minister have any statistics on the average sum in rebates owing to companies and if so could she furnish them to me later?</p>
            <p eId="para_163">Is it possible, in prioritising those to whom money is owed, to examine the serious cases that are owed a large sum of money because some businesses are under immense pressure to get the money back?  They are legally obliged to pay it out and do so as the person leaves the premises.  We must work with them on this because it is not acceptable that they must wait six or seven months, which could become eight or nine months in some cases.  I will not argue with the Minister because she has given a fair answer, and has admitted it but we must do more to address the problem.  The Minister needs another plan A to deal with this for the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_164">The Deputy is right.  Had we discussed this four or five years ago the complaint would have been that the work permit section was not delivering quickly enough.  We have transferred many of those people to the redundancy section.  Following further meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, we have not just added 20 staff but transferred an additional 14.  I have also requested another staff transfer which I believe the Minister for Health and Children will facilitate with an additional ten people to effect that transformation as quickly as possible.  We will also use NERA so that people can do the work while someone else answers the telephone.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">I do not disagree.  I know that everybody is crying out for the few euro to which they are entitled, for one reason or another.  We have met several businesses which have asked us to transfer the money to the Revenue Commissioners to get these people off their backs.  We have facilitated that on an individual basis but only with the client's imprimatur.  We continue to do all we can to try to deal with this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">I hope that the Deputy will be proved wrong about the number of redundancy notices that have been put in.  There was a high number between January and March of this year but we will do all we can.  If other ideas, or initiatives that need to be taken, I will be forthcoming.  One suggestion was that we outsource this work but I have not yet come to a final agreement on that but if necessary it is another option.</p>

            <p eId="para_179">In the context of the Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009, the Government and the social partners agreed to the implementation of a series of measures, including the introduction of legislation, to strengthen the existing system for the making of both employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements and to provide for their continued effective operation.  The Bill to give effect to this commitment will be published as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_180">I thank the Minister of State.  This is important because it fulfils a commitment made under the 2016 agreement.  It is important that the measures are aimed at modernising and streamlining the joint labour committee systems, including the rationalisation of the number of the committees involved and the appointment of professional chairpersons with experience.  Does the Minister of State consider that bringing forward the Bill would give an impetus to the resolution of the current dispute which we will debate later today?</p>

            <p eId="para_181">We urge all parties involved in the present dispute to use the industrial relations machinery available to them and engage with the Labour Relations Commission because this is having a profound impact on the economy, as well as the immediate issue.  The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the joint labour committees and the employment regulation orders.  There was a commitment to streamline them but the hotel and catering sector and consequently the electrical contractors launched legal challenges to them.  The High Court found the law to be defective.  The commitment remains and we will publish the Bill quite soon but I doubt whether the Bill, published or unpublished, would have any impact on the present dispute.  I urge those involved to engage with the industrial relations machinery available to them.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_184">We do not need legislation for that.  A number of them, including the catering one, have been amalgamated already.  The issue which may require legislation is the fact that the courts may determine that employment regulation orders, EROs, are not legal because they have the sanction of the Labour Court and not ministerial sanction.  I understand that one of the actions that may be dealt with in the Bill is that if this court case goes in a certain way, all EROs would fall as they would never have had legal weight.  This Bill would require the Minister, rather than just the Labour Court, to sign off on all EROs.  Legislation on those grounds would seem reasonable.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">We also need to go further.  Does the Tánaiste agree that there must be more far-reaching reform of the way joint labour committees, JLCs, and employment regulation orders work?  With regard to the role of representative bodies, should there not be legislative definition of whether a body is representative of most employees?  On many of these, they are not entirely representative, and there must be a clearer legal definition of the role of the chairperson.  It is the case that with joint labour committees and EROs, the chairperson's casting vote determines the outcome.  Unlike what we have with the electricians, it is not an agreement, and employment regulation orders are imposed by a committee.  Often, they are not agreements at all and they are not claimed to be such.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">There are two issues at stake; first and foremost there was a commitment in Towards 2016 that there would be a streamlining of the JLCs.  As there are too many of them, we wanted to streamline them in order to have strong representation.  There is also the issue of the independence of a chairperson.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">Since then there have been challenges to the way we make the orders and it is required in the legislation that we would have the cover of the Oireachtas through ministerial order rather than us delegating too many functions from this House to the Labour Court.  That was the issue challenged in the courts.  I am sure people would not object to the streamlining of JLCs but in the actual detail——</p>

         if she has made a submission in regard to the review of the national minimum wage currently being carried out by the Labour Court; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_197">In November 2008, ICTU requested the Labour Court to review the national minimum wage and to make a recommendation to me concerning its adjustment.  The court is required under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to consult with representatives of employers and employees in the private sector and the public sector of the economy.  In this regard, I understand that the court invited submissions from IBEC, ICTU and the Department of Finance.  The Labour Court also held discussions with these parties and I understand that the matter is still under consideration by the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">Given my responsibilities under the Act with regard to the consideration of any eventual Labour Court recommendation on the minimum wage, it would not be appropriate for me to make a submission on the matter to the court and I have not done so.</p>

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_100">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_199">The Department of Finance has made a submission so the Government has a position on it.  The Labour Party does not think there is any justification for decreasing the minimum wage or cutting in any way the basic levels of social welfare, so we may as well start from that premise.  The arguments for increasing it can be discussed with regard to current economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Many of those people in receipt of minimum wage or at the basic level of social welfare have the highest propensity to spend in the economy.  The propensity of these people to save is minimal because they do not have such resources, so if we cut their available resources further, it will have a further deflationary effect on the economy.  It is important to note this, and I do so as somebody who must pay the minimum wage.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">Has there been any indication of how far the Labour Court has progressed in its assessment of the position?  Is it correct that once it has made recommendations to the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, he will have three months to consider them?  Is it the position that the minimum level of wage, on which ICTU and IBEC have adopted different stances, has not been reported on by the Labour Court, despite it being there for a considerable period?  Is that an indication of difficulties?  That is neither here nor there.  Does the Government intend to resolve the issue within the context of the new round of social partnership talks rather than wait for the Labour Court to deal with it?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_202">The Labour Court would be very cognisant of ongoing discussions within the social partnership process and on that basis, I expect that the Labour Court would not be making a recommendation to the Minister of State.  I have heard both sides of the argument.  I had the opportunity to meet Commissioner Spidla and he indicated that the labour relations issues we have — the minimum wage, the EROs and JLCs — are such that we will not have an imposition of further legislation from the European Union on the basis of our own domestic policy.  That is unlike a number of other member states, where the European Union is giving direction on issues that must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">The issue of the national minimum wage is causing difficulty, particularly in some of the very vulnerable sectors, but at the same time we must give assurances to people who are vulnerable in these sectors that they have an entitlement.  We must balance both of these factors.  Until such a time as we have seen a finality in the social partnership process, I am in anticipation of a decision from the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">It is important to reiterate the Taoiseach's comments in the House last week in that we have seen the unit labour costs in Ireland reduced by 7%, which will address our competitiveness.</p>

            <p eId="para_205">Like with many issues, real information on this is rarely shared in the House.  That has much to do with the way democracy has declined in this country under the past 12 years of a Fianna Fáil-led Government.  There is a draft document on <i>The Irish Times</i> website outlining the proposals submitted by the Government to the social partners with regard to pay in the private sector.  The Government’s draft document indicates the review of the minimum wage being carried out by the Labour Court should now be suspended.  Is that document authentic and is it the Government’s position with regard to the negotiations with social partners that it should be agreed that the Labour Court review of the minimum wage would be suspended?  </p>

            <p eId="para_206">I have much more to be doing than reading <i>The Irish Times</i>, and from what I can see, the Deputy spends 99.9% of his time on the Internet and the computer.  I do not have the time to read <i>The Irish Times</i> and what it has to say.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">It is my responsibility not to make any public pronouncement on the basis that we must adjudicate within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  As we all know, the views of the Department of Finance relate only to that Department and I cannot give any public comment on the issue.  I do not want to find myself in a position where I could be brought before the House having expressed a public opinion which, <i>per se</i>, is not a recommendation from the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">I have indicated that while the partnership process is ongoing and as there has not been final deliberation on this issue, I will not expect a recommendation from the Labour Court until it comes to fruition.  It is my expectation that the maturity I have seen, regardless of what has happened this week, on both sides would reflect the economic difficulties we are currently experiencing.  We must await the outcome of the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_210">I am precluded from expressing a view on the matter.  However, it is important to say that there is an opinion among many companies which are struggling that the level at which national minimum wage is set is causing them difficulties.  It is not necessarily that people are in receipt of the national minimum wage but these companies are of the view what is over and above that wage is causing those difficulties.  We introduced the national minimum wage in the first instance in order to provide protection to people, particularly those working for vulnerable companies, who might not have had the capacity or capability to express their own views.

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_213">IDA Ireland has worked with the Braun Oral B management team to seek replacement projects for the Carlow operation.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IDA Ireland have had meetings at corporate level with Proctor &amp; Gamble in the United States to explore opportunities for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">The decision to exit certain product lines was taken following the steady decline in consumer demand for gas-powered hair care appliances in recent years.  A sourcing study was initiated to examine all potential options for Carlow.  Regrettably, the decision of the study is that in order to keep the business viable, the company will transfer the remaining product lines from Carlow to the Braun Oral B manufacturing site at Newbridge, with the closure of the Carlow site by mid-2010.  This is disappointing for Carlow.  However, a decision was made to keep the business in Ireland and Braun Oral B will be able to secure future employment for approximately 100 of the Carlow employees at the Newbridge site.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">IDA Ireland's strategy for County Carlow within the south-east region is to progress the development of a knowledge economy in order that it, and particularly the county town of Carlow, can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  Specifically, this includes the provision of world-class property solutions with supporting infrastructure and working with local development partner agencies in County Carlow to advance critical supporting infrastructure, both hard and soft, which will contribute to a sustainable business environment for the long term.  IDA Ireland is also actively engaged with the existing client base in County Carlow to encourage its transition to continually higher-value activities to promote further investment in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">Carlow has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing, with a strong engineering tradition in both the indigenous and overseas sectors.  For companies in the engineering and consumer products sectors, the business environment has become more challenging in recent years.  With much of the investment globally in these sectors now going to low-cost destinations such as eastern Europe and China, the task of moving up the value chain becomes increasingly urgent and relevant.</p>

            <p eId="para_218">In marketing Carlow for new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland is focused on  attracting overseas companies in the life sciences, services and knowledge based industries including advanced manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">To assist in the retention and creation of jobs, the Government, through the enterprise development agencies, the county enterprise boards and other interested parties, adopts a co-ordinated approach in marketing and promoting inward investment and enterprise development.  In addition, all the agencies work together to make people aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment or to start their own businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">I am pleased that, in this instance, not all of the jobs involved will be lost.  I appreciate the fact that the chief executive of the relevant company telephoned me to outline the difficulties it is experiencing.  It is a welcome development that approximately 100 of the Carlow employees will be retained at the Newbridge site.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">I accept that we are living in extremely difficult times.  However, there have been major job losses in Carlow and Athy.  Employment in the industrial sector in south Kildare and Carlow has been badly hit, at companies such as Braun, Lapple, the Irish Sugar Company and a number of others in Athy.  I understand that problems exist.  However, I request that consideration be given, in the context of the overall picture, to the area to which I refer.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">When I was employed by Braun, the workforce there numbered some 1,400.  Now, however, the doors of what is a magnificent facility are to be closed.  In addition, Lapple and the Irish Sugar Company were also been closed.  Carlow is now a major unemployment blackspot.  Some ten companies have also moved their operations out of Athy.  The State agencies must consider what action to take in respect of this area and I ask the Minister of State to provide a commitment that they will do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_223">I would be delighted to give such a commitment.  I wish to reassure the Deputy that IDA Ireland has a commitment to Carlow.  It is important to note that earlier this year Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme announced an investment of €20 million and 160 additional jobs.  In addition, the US-based company, Unum, also announced the creation of jobs in Carlow.  There is a real commitment on the part of the agencies to co-ordinate their efforts in order to ensure that Carlow will not become an unemployment blackspot in industrial terms.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_227">I am sure every Member is extremely concerned with regard to the situation in respect of industrial relations at present.  We must ask ourselves how, in July 2009, we have arrived at a point where proven and expensive mechanisms for resolving industrial disputes have failed.  At a time of unprecedented economic difficulty for our country, we find ourselves in a strike position.  People believe that this strike relates to pay but it is sending out the wrong message with regard to our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Despite the difficulties the Government has been experiencing, the international perception of Ireland was that at least some attempts were being made to resolve and deal with those difficulties.  We may differ in respect of the decisions the Government has taken but the message being sent out into the international arena has the potential to become absolutely catastrophic in the context of the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> employment in this country.  Some 418,000 people are currently on the live register, the message is being sent out that Ireland is in a strike position.  That begs the question as to how we have arrived at a point where our industrial relations machinery has not been able to resolve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Taoiseach has placed his personal credibility on the line on a number of occasions in respect of social partnership.  I understand that this is not a simple problem and that there are aspects which will prove difficult to get right.  However, the Association of Electrical Contractors of Ireland made an arrangement with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, which was subsequently appealed to the High Court.  What is the Government's view in respect of whether that arrangement is legally binding?  Does the Government have an opinion on the matter?  Has it been advised by the Attorney General, as the legal officer to the State, that the agreement entered into a number of years ago is legally binding?  That is the net question and the answer to it will provide an indication of the nature of the solution which might be arrived at.  In the interests of finding a solution to this complex issue, will the Taoiseach indicate whether it is the view of the Government that the agreement to which I refer is legally binding?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_112">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_230">It is important to state that it is clear a situation has arisen that is damaging to the specific industry in which the industrial dispute has arisen and which potentially has wider damaging effects for the economy.  I note that a Private Notice Question has been scheduled for 5 p.m. this afternoon regarding the details of the dispute and it is important that rather than emphasising the merits of their respective cases, the House should call on both sides to use the industrial relations machinery and considerable expertise that is available in the State.  Every industrial relations dispute is a matter of deep regret and it is important to be prepared to ensure both sides use the available machinery and to try to resolve this dispute quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">On the question of registered employment agreements, pay in the electrical contracting sector is set out in a registered employment agreement that sets legally binding minimum rates for the industry, which covers electrical contractors.  Up to last year, the increase was calculated through an analogue pay comparison exercise, based on the pay of electricians outside the contracting industry.  While certain legal challenges have been brought to the agreement, the issue is that of an industrial relations dispute, based on an existing registered employment agreement, which must be resolved through the use of the industrial relations machinery. I believe that process should be used to the full.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_232">With respect, that reply does not answer the question.  My concern is about the message that is going out about Ireland and the position in which we find ourselves, whereby public perception is that a strike is being held on the basis of a pay increase.  That is fine until people begin to understand that 418,000 people and rising now are on the live register and that companies with major productivity concerns are being affected by this dispute, despite having had neither hand, act nor part in it.  There has been evidence to this effect from Diageo, Cadbury and a number of major infrastructural projects that are under way at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">This issue arose neither today nor yesterday but has been signalled for some time, and since last November in particular.  The point is that although everyone will call for both sides to come together and to use the State mechanisms to resolve this issue before it reaches a potentially catastrophic position, a decision cannot be made until there is evidence of what is the answer to the question I raised.  At the time when the Tánaiste reported to her Cabinet colleagues on this matter, surely there was an obligation for the evidence and advice of the Attorney General to be given as to whether the agreement is legally binding.  If it is legally binding, then there is one answer, while if it is not, there is a different answer.  While using the mechanisms of State and if it is legally binding, it may be that the money due will be paid and agreement then will be reached on a freezing of rates or whatever.  I understand there is room to drop both the claim for a decrease or cut back in wages and the claim for an increase in wages, depending on the resolution of the question of whether this agreement is legally binding.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I note the Taoiseach has made a strong case a number of times about social partnership and I have heard the comments of the President in this regard.  Has that question been addressed in the briefing given by the Tánaiste to her Cabinet colleagues?  As this question was not fully and finally signed off by the Labour Court, what is the Government's response to that?  Is the agreement therefore legally binding or not?  The answer to that question leads to a solution of this issue.  This strike will end through discussion and dialogue.  However, central to such discussion and dialogue will be the answer to this question.  The Taoiseach does not wish to see any further deterioration in Ireland's employment situation or progress, as we are in dire straits as it is.  However, this problem has gone on since last November and I do not want the legal mechanisms for resolving industrial disputes to fail to such an extent that the message goes out about Ireland that, in the midst of the greatest economic and unemployment crises it ever has faced, workers in the electrical sector are on strike for a pay increase, particularly given that 418,000 other people are signing on the live register.  I again ask the Taoiseach to address this central question.  Has the Government received advice?  Has the Tánaiste briefed her colleagues as to whether this agreement, in the Government's view, is legally binding or otherwise?  Alternatively, will the Government be obliged to appoint an interlocutor or to seek adjudication from the High Court on that net question?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_114">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_235">As I explained to the Deputy, the general principle is that registered agreements such as this form the basis upon which rates of pay are set.  Obviously, this is not simply a legal issue.  I acknowledge there have been challenges by various employer bodies to the actual basis of the registered employment agreement, REA, itself.  However, the position is that were it a simple case as outlined by the Deputy, I am sure the issue would have been resolved by now.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The Labour Court hearing on the electrical registered employment agreement took place in June 2008, when it held an hearing to consider an application to vary that agreement to provide for the 5% increase due from April 2008.  However, a stay was placed by the High Court on the court proceeding with the hearing, following a challenge by a group of independent electrical contractors.  This stay eventually was lifted by the High Court in October, to allow the Labour Court to proceed.  Subsequently, over 11 days in January and February 2009, the Labour Court heard applications both to vary the existing electrical contracting REA and to cancel the registration of the REA.  The proposed variation would have involved an increase to the minimum pay rates set out in the registered employment agreement.  That application to vary was opposed by one of the bodies representing electrical contractors, which sought to have the registration cancelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">On 26 February, the Labour Court made its decision in respect of the electrical REA.  The lengthy decision covered the applications firstly to vary the agreement and secondly to cancel the agreement.  In respect of the application to vary it, as there was no agreement among the employer bodies party to the registered employment agreement to so do, the application was refused.  The court also rejected the application to cancel the agreement.  Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the court came to the view that the changes in the electrical contracting industry since the registration of the REA have not made it undesirable to maintain its registration.  Accordingly, the court did not propose to cancel the registration of the agreement.  That decision now is the subject of a judicial review challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">In the course of its decision, the court noted that, on balance, it was satisfied that as a matter of probability, rates of pay would decline in the sector in the absence of the REA.  It therefore noted that while the case was adhering regarding the court, it indicated that it might be desirable to make recommendations on certain matters of an industrial relations nature — one should leave out the courts for the present — that were raised in the course of the hearings.  None of the parties objected to it so doing and the Labour Court made recommendations in respect of rates of pay and the review of the REA, which are outlined in its lengthy recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The issue in this regard is simple.  A dispute is under way but we have industrial relations machinery by which it can be resolved.  It is important that everyone takes on the responsibility of getting this dispute resolved.  I believe the means still exist by which this can be done using the industrial relations machinery, were people so minded.  We have a voluntary basis for industrial relations in Ireland and cannot impose a solution.  However, we need both parties to use the machinery that is available and to enter negotiations while minded to move from respective positions in a manner that will achieve an outcome that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_240">What steps is the Government taking, if any, to bring about a resolution of the dispute?  This is a serious dispute because of the number of electricians involved and the number of sites and places of employment directly affected by it.  It is also serious because of the potential knock-on effect on the wider economy.  As the Taoiseach said, there is a voluntary system of industrial relations.  The problem is that the nature and complexity of this dispute and the degree to which the industrial relations issues in dispute criss-cross with legal challenges means that it is unusual.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Tánaiste has powers under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to cause the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission to intervene in this dispute.  Under section 38 of the Act, where a dispute affects the public interest, as this does, the Tánaiste has the power to ask the Labour Court to intervene directly.  Second, where the dispute is of special importance, she has the power to appoint the Labour Court or some other body to inquire into it and make a report to her.  This is the kind of dispute for which these powers were envisaged under the Industrial Relations Act.  Is it intended that these powers will be used to bring the parties together?  From what we have heard on the airwaves, there is quite a degree of disagreement between the parties.  This is what happens in a dispute.  Sometimes, the longer the dispute goes on, the more entrenched these positions become.  It is in everyone's interest that this intervention is made sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">There have been problems with registered employment agreements.  The Taoiseach referred to the court challenge taken by some electrical contractors to this registered employment agreement.  There have been other court challenges to agreements in the hotel industry in respect of the joint labour committee system.  The Government promised to bring in legislation to modernise the joint labour committee system and the registered employment agreement system.  We have all heard of difficulties that arise in respect of electricians, hotels, catering, security and a number of other industries covered by registered employment agreements.  The legislation has been promised for some time and does not appear to have advanced.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when this will be progressed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_116">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I thank Deputy Gilmore for his comments.  Powers are available under various Acts to a Minister, and in this case the Tánaiste, in respect of interventions in disputes.  The use of that statutory power does not guarantee an outcome, nor does it provide us with the means by which an outcome may be achieved.  At the request of the National Implementation Body, a reference to the Labour Court for further discussion was made.  This took place on Saturday but did not prove successful.  Contact continues between the Labour Relations Commission and both sides in the dispute.  There is a need for both sides to be minded to use the process in a way that is beneficial in respect of an outcome to the dispute.  The process of engagements behind the scenes, away from public view, between the Labour Relations Commission and both sides is part of that exercise.  It is a matter of judgment in terms of how this proceeds.  This is the best way in which to try to see how the matter can be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Government is aware of the various provisions introduced by the 1990 Act to augment and supplement previous powers.  We have a voluntary process of industrial relations for obvious reasons.  It is open to the Minister to use these powers if we believe it will provide a resolution to the dispute.  Simply bringing people to the Labour Relations Commission, or the Labour Court in this instance using these powers, does not in itself guarantee an outcome as we have seen from the engagement thus far.  Contact and communication continues with both sides to see if it would be timely to return to the commission to see if a resolution can be found.  These powers remain in reserve and are available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_245">I accept that the Government and the Minister should not intervene in every industrial relations dispute that arises.  It is a question of judgment when the intervention should take place.  Where there is a dispute and an employer is involved, the approach outlined by the Taoiseach is appropriate.  In this particular case, because of the extent of the dispute, the degree to which it involves employers and contractors directly and the knock-on effect for other employment and the wider economy, it is appropriate that the Government underlines the seriousness with which it takes the dispute and underlines the urgency that the Government should give to having it resolved by using the powers available under the Industrial Relations Act to bring people together.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Sometimes, when a dispute goes on for a bit, positions become entrenched and people say things that are difficult to resile from, while others are willing to throw oil on troubled waters.  Where people are not talking to each other, are not willing to talk for whatever reason and we do not how long it will go on, there is a necessity for somebody to knock heads together.  I suggest this is one of the occasions where the Government, through the Tánaiste, should use the services of the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission to knock heads together and achieve an early settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The dispute will be settled eventually and it will be settled by people sitting down, talking to each other, working out the complexity of the issues involved and agreeing a settlement.  It is better that the settlement of the dispute is secured earlier rather than later, in order to minimise the damage that a prolonged dispute will do to those involved, their employers and the wider economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_118">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_248">I agree that all Members of the House wish to see a resolution of this dispute as quickly as possible.  We have industrial relations machinery in place.  Engagement with the Labour Relations Commission has not been exhausted.  We are bringing forward the Labour Relations Commission as a means of dealing with many of these issues without getting to the ultimate position of the Labour Court.  The work of the Labour Relations Commission is not exhausted.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Quite apart from the need to resolve this dispute quickly, there is a need to find some means by which co-operative approaches can be established in the relationship between the parties.  It is an issue in respect of pay, the strike and what arises out of that, the background to it and the need to improve relations.  The Labour Relations Commission remains the best available option based on the engagement to date.  The National Implementation Body, which has a strong status in industrial relations procedures, is the body that referred this matter to the Labour Relations Commission in the first place.  We do not have a resolution to this dispute.  We wish to see a resolution as soon as possible.  I urge the parties to redouble their efforts to resolve the issues in dispute.  The only way in which they can find an equitable resolution is through that method.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">It is to be deeply regretted that attempts to resolve the dispute have so far failed but it is not an indication in any way of complacency on the Government's part regarding the use or non-use of statutory powers.  The Government, through the independent industrial relations machinery available through the State aegis of the Labour Relations Commission stands ready and is engaged with the parties in an effort to find a basis upon which a resumption of discussions might have the prospect of success.  That work is continuing and a precondition to success.</p>

As Deputy Kenny stated, there are nine guillotines on the schedule this week with which we were presented and in addition I understand another four guillotines are on the way in respect of one piece of legislation due to be taken this week.  This would bring us to 13 guillotines this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Government is going about ordering the business of the House in a very illogical way.  The Ceann Comhairle will recall that last Thursday I objected to the Order of Business on the grounds that the Government had ordered the Bills the wrong way round.  I pointed out that there was a guillotine on the first item at 2 p.m. and that I believed the two remaining items would not run their full course and that if we had ordered them the other way round that the full day would have been sufficient to deal with the business.  Of course, what happened was exactly that; we ended up with a vote at 2 p.m. on the guillotine on the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill with a number of amendments undiscussed and then moved on to the other business.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The House was scheduled to sit until 10 p.m. and it finished at 6 p.m. because, as I predicted, there was not the level of debate that the Government anticipated on the salaries and allowances to be paid to Members of the European Parliament for which it allowed four and three quarter hours on Thursday's business even though it was not going to take that amount of time.  The same situation will arise this Thursday where I understand the Government has allocated five hours to all Stages of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Bill 2009.  I do not anticipate that there will be sufficient Deputies offering to require five hours of debate.  Even if the Government is trying to order business within the timeframe between now and Friday evening it could do so in a more sensible way than it is doing at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I agree with Deputy Kenny in that I do not see any reason the House cannot continue sitting for the rest of the month; if there is legislative business we will deal with it and we will be better dealing with it in a reasoned way, taking the amount of time required rather than having it rushed through in guillotines and having these long sittings that probably do not lend themselves to the type of parliamentary scrutiny that legislation should receive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I could be contradicted but my sense is that there has never been as many guillotines employed in the lead up to the summer recess, certainly in my years of experience here.  As Opposition Deputies have repeatedly cautioned, it has already been proven that many guillotines were unnecessary.  I believe they should only be applied in the most exceptional of circumstances.  They were not applied to many of the propositions put before us over recent weeks.  With whom does the Chief Whip tic-tac-toe on the hours necessary to address these Bills?  It is not mirrored in any of the Opposition voices or by our respective Whips.  I do not know and fail to understand the configuration repeatedly presented.  The same mistakes are signalled to recur again this week.  I oppose the imposition of the guillotine on the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 after one and a half hours with more than 40 amendments to be addressed and the business to conclude at midnight.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_133">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_269">I understand the Harbours (Amendment) Bill has been extensively debated in the Seanad and here over a long period and that many amendments which have already been extensively debated are being re-entered.  It is a prerogative of Deputies to re-enter amendments if they so wish.  It is not correct to suggest that many of these amendments have not already been debated.  They have, but are being resubmitted for further discussion, the issues having already been given a full explanation.  However, resubmitting of amendments is a procedural matter.  There has been extensive debate on the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">In the case of the criminal justice legislation planned for this week, further time has been provided by the Chief Whip in an effort to accommodate the requirements and demands of the House on the matter.  Many of the guillotines ordered for the House on the Order of Business have not had to be utilised because of fewer speakers presenting or the shorter length of time required to deal with a Bill when it comes to the crunch.  Deputy Gilmore may be able to point up a particular instance, but the Chief Whip has sought, working with the other Whips concerned, to accommodate Deputies to the best extent he can and predict as well as he can the interest in and level of debate and the time required to be allocated for Bills.  One does not always get it exactly right, but he has got it right more often than not in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I take the point made.  The issue always arises with regard to end of session issues.  The guillotine may not need to be used, but it must be provided for in the ordering of business to ensure the Government gets through the agenda it sets.</p>

I offer support to the Government in its efforts to secure her safe release and return her to her work and to her family.  In that respect, I express our concern to her parents Mark and Agatha.

          <p eId="para_423">I join with Deputy Kenny on the first point.  As I have already stated, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Government and I have indicated that the safeguarding of the welfare of our citizens abroad at all times must be a particular priority of any Government.  We attach the highest importance to securing the safe and timely release of Sharon Commins and her Ugandan colleague, Hilda Kawuki.  The House will be aware that, on being made aware of this abduction, the Government began a concerted and focused response, co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and involving several Government Departments and agencies, and a multidisciplinary team of experienced experts, who were rapidly dispatched to Sudan to manage the situation on the ground and to seek an early resolution to what is a very difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The Government of Sudan has assured us that the abduction is being treated very seriously and that everything possible is being done to secure the release of the two aid workers.  I want to put on the record our appreciation for the efforts and assistance of the authorities which we are obtaining.  I met the UN Secretary General today for a working lunch.  The UN personnel on the ground have been very helpful in terms of providing logistics and help to ensure we get around to those people we need to get around to in order to find out what is happening and identify possible abductors.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The Government remains in close contact with the family.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken to members of the family to emphasise we are doing everything in our power to ensure the safe release of Ms Commins and her colleague.  We have also been liaising closely with the British, French and Canadian Governments, which have previous experience of similar abductions involving aid workers, including in Darfur itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Everything that can be done at this stage is being done.  I am fully cognisant of the need to keep the public informed of developments but I am also aware of the need for discretion in what we say in public.  The Irish team in Sudan is working diligently and should be allowed to get on with its work.  I am sure it has the support of the House in so doing.  I want to assure the House the full range of expertise and contacts at the disposal of the Irish Government and the NGO system in Sudan is being mobilised to assist with this operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">With regard to the other issues raised by the Deputy, it is expected that we will announce the date for the referendum, which I had indicated would be in early October, on the discussion of the referendum Bill in the House this week.  We are still working to bring forward the other legislation for publication this month with a view to returning in September but no decision has been taken yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">We are in the final week of the Dáil session before the summer recess.  The Government has already set in train arrangements for the National Asset Management Agency without any legislative basis or any substantive debate in real terms.  We must take on board that billions of euro of taxpayers' money and untold sums of public moneys are committed to facilitating the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  It was promised not only that we would have the legislation by this week but that it would have been published long ago, that there would have been a full debate and that it would have gone through its final passage, in whatever form it was to take ultimately, having been discussed and debated here intently.  We have yet to see the published legislation on NAMA.  What is the situation at present?  Are the heads of the Bill agreed at this point?  Is there any prospect we will see the publication of the Bill this week?  Will we have sight of it before the Dáil rises at the end of the week?  What will the status be if we do not have the opportunity of substantive debate of the necessary legislation?  What is the Government's intention for the National Asset Management Agency for the period of the summer recess?  Will it call back the Dáil early to facilitate address of the legislation that is long promised?</p>

As the Deputy will be aware it is a very arduous and complex task in terms of bringing forward the structure for the implementation of the decision and also the legislative basis underpinning it.  He has indicated that a target of July has been set for the bringing forward of the legislation and he has indicated a preparedness to have the House return in September for a special sitting to discuss the legislation, enact it and bring it forward.  That is the consistent position he has outlined and I simply reiterate it.  That is what he is working towards.</p>

At the North-South meeting certain briefings were given concerning NAMA suggesting it would be done over a very lengthy period, perhaps ten years or more.  It seems odd to brief people in detail from the Northern Ireland Executive but not to be in a position to brief the Dáil.  There is also a suggestion that one of the factors that will now influence the approach is the impact of NAMA on property prices in the North.</p>

That remains the target of the Minister and that is the information I can bring to the House.  I am surprised to hear the argumentation continuing from Deputy Burton who raised the matter on Leaders' Questions.  I thought I explained clearly that the valuation methodology would be consistent and on the basis of commercial criteria applied to all assets regardless of where they are located.  What took place yesterday in terms of the political dialogue between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government was an agreement to brief the Finance Minister of the Northern Ireland Executive regarding the policy position of the Government such that they can understand and know where it fits into whatever policy initiatives they have.  I made the point earlier, and it is well known, the NAMA legislation is not about organising fire sales everywhere but about trying to get a longer time horizon in which to recover value to these assets such that taxpayers' exposure can be reduced apart from ensuring the reductions are taken by the people who have the debts and the banks in the first instance.  I made all of this clear less than one hour ago.</p>

The second issue is the ongoing pharmacy dispute.  Whatever one's view is of that dispute, sooner or later the Government will have to talk to pharmacists about the services they provide, and by talk I mean negotiation.  It states in the Government's legislative programme that the heads of the Bill are yet to be agreed.  Will the Taoiseach accept the urgency of this matter?

            <p eId="para_478">The Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union took strike action on Monday, 6 July 2009.  This action follows the breakdown of talks at the Labour Relations Commission.  The National Implementation Body issued a statement on the dispute on Friday, 3 July urging the parties to re-engage with the LRC to explore the full range of issues at the centre of the dispute, with a view to averting threatened action.

            <p eId="para_481">Huge challenges face the country.  Our economy faces a prolonged slowdown, which is likely to stretch into 2012 if there is not a change of Government.  Everyone is feeling the drag from the housing meltdown and the turbulence in the financial markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">Is the Tánaiste prepared to take her head out of the sand and cope with this urgent and pressing matter, which has been called economic suicide by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, in a decisive manner which will prioritise the economic well-being of the country, bring forward solutions to resolve the strike and convince the strikers that she will reform the system to get the economy back on track while protecting the workers?</p>
            <p eId="para_483">With the Taoiseach predicting that half a million people will be out of work by the end of year, can the Tánaiste justify — other than in her prepared response to my question — the havoc this strike will unleash on business, farming and the construction, tourism and other industries, and the human suffering the resulting unemployment will cause across the country?  The strike is affecting hospitals and the new terminal at Dublin Airport, which will have a huge impact on the tourism industry.  It is also affecting the roll-out of broadband and several other industries.</p>
            <p eId="para_484">It is a matter of urgent priority for the Tánaiste to take action and bring about a solution to this problem as soon as possible.  The Irish construction industry is already on its knees.  Can the Tánaiste condone the Government's action, which has affected both the electricians and the wider building sector, which will be forced to lay off workers to the detriment of the industry and workers and their families?</p>
            <p eId="para_485">I have every sympathy with the electricians' grievances, which are part of the spiralling cutbacks in wages and jobs which have their source in the Government's reckless overheating of the economy.  Will the Tánaiste set out an action plan in terms of a real stimulus package with initiatives across the country to solve the present impasse with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and give the country some hope?  The country needs hope urgently.  I plead with the Tánaiste to give young people and the unemployed real hope for the future.  The country cannot sustain 500,000 people out of work by the end of this year.  I plead with the Tánaiste to take whatever actions are possible to solve this impasse.</p>

            <p eId="para_488">Perhaps the Deputy is not familiar with all of the issues and complications which have been part of this registered employment agreement, REA, for a considerable time, the amount of litigation which has taken place, the deliberations of the Labour Court and its recommendation that there be further consideration, particularly on the question of pay but also on the reform of the REA.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">The Labour Relations Commission, LRC, has indicated its willingness to facilitate both sides.  Following its meeting on Friday last, the National Implementation Body, NIB, indicated that it could not bring the matter to a conclusion and that an impasse remains.  I have asked the LRC to bring both parties together to see if we can bring the matter to a resolution.  There are two polarised perspectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">Good industrial relations are critical.  It is important that a resolution is not imposed.  That would fly in the face of our industrial relations history, which is voluntary in nature.  Through my Department and the LRC, the mechanisms are available by which the matter could be brought to resolution.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_491">In the last number of days, the Labour Party has urged that intervention in this strategically important industry be undertaken at the earliest possible opportunity.  The industrial action taken by more than 10,000 members of the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, is a serious development which could have significant consequences for industrial relations.  As was pointed out earlier today by my party leader, the dispute will have a knock-on effect on building sites and on employment generally.  As the Tánaiste has said, this is the first major strike in the private sector for some time and it comes in a period of significant economic difficulty for the country.  If it is allowed to drag on, it could lead to lay-offs of workers not directly involved in the dispute.  Important issues are involved in the dispute for employers and workers and these issues will have to be resolved at some stage by face-to-face dialogue and discussion.  It is in everyone's interest that this process of dialogue begins now rather than at the end of a prolonged and costly strike.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">This morning I listened carefully to Mr. Eamon Devoy and Mr. Tom Parlon discussing the matter on the radio.  There is no point in coming to talks but sitting on one's hands and saying nothing.  There must be an element of compromise.  From what I heard Mr. Devoy saying this morning, the TEEU is ready to come to talks but there must be a show of positivity.  The country does not need a strike.  Neither does it need employers arbitrarily undermining registered agreements.  All strikes are settled.  The time to intervene in this strike is now.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">The Labour Party has pointed out that there are powers in the Act which were envisaged for precisely this purpose.  Section 38 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 gives the Minister the power to refer a dispute to the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission when the public interest is affected.  The Minister is now in continual contact with the Labour Relations Commission.  There cannot be a more important public interest than the protection of jobs and the maintenance of an important service.  No one doubts the importance of this dispute and the intervention of the Minister is clearly justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">I listened carefully to the discussion on the radio this morning.  Is it not time that REAs were simplified so that everyone has a clear understanding of what is involved in them and their impact on the issues involved?  There should be no room for ambiguity.  No one should be able to argue that an award is X% while someone else argues that it is X+1%.  Earlier, I asked the Tánaiste about the progress of the industrial relations Bill.  Such clarification would be an important function of such a Bill.  The rationalisation of the joint labour committees, JLCs, and the implementation of other measures are important.  However, the strengthening of the existing REA system providing for its continued effective operation would ensure that REAs are clear and unambiguous and that everyone understands their effect.  This would widen the number of people involved in the REA system.  Operational procedures must be improved and the nomination of chairpersons of JLCs should, obviously, follow consultation with social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The Labour Party would support every effort to use the industrial relations machinery to resolve this dispute.  Everyone must show willingness to enter talks.  Participants must not come to talks with nothing to offer.  They must be prepared to be positive in discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">If the sum awarded had been paid in 2008 a new REA would reflect the economic conditions pertaining currently.  We cannot hark back but I call on all sides to talk.  From our contacts with the trade unions, I know that they are eager to progress matters but it takes two to tango and there is no use in starting with preconceived ideas about cutting things off and so on.  I appeal for a compromise that will ensure a return to work for everyone involved, from the bodies in question to other affected parties.  We need people working at Dublin Airport, the new facility at Lansdowne Road and so on.  Everyone should sit down in a positive framework and not set in advance conditions or bottom lines beyond which they will not go.  The latter is not the way to start proper and positive negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">I concur with the Deputy, in that people cannot start with the polarised views being expressed by both sides in public.  Naturally, the argument has two sides.  The Oireachtas has an expectation that the registered employment agreements, REAs, and joint labour committees, JLCs, should be shored up by the Industrial Relations Act.  We look forward to the discussion on this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">It may be unfortunate that both situations are occurring simultaneously but it is important that I articulate again the difficulties experienced in terms of the REA with the electrical contractors.  As the Deputy knows, the union is seeking two pay increases and the methodology on achieving them, the analogue system, is being disputed.  The employers have indicated that given the economic circumstances, reductions in contract prices and, as the Deputies have articulated, the fact that employers are not necessarily getting paid for the work done, they are in a difficult position.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">The House can appreciate both sides of the argument, but we must equally appreciate that the matter must be brought to a resolution one way or the other.  The Labour Court recommended that the REA should not be varied or cancelled.  However, there was a meeting of minds on the methodology by which pay increases could be reached and on the REA's review.  This is a natural industrial relations policy that we would like to see progress, but none of it will occur with this impasse.  Rather, it will only occur when the two sides come together.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">I fully agree with the Deputy that people will need to leave polarised views elsewhere if they are to determine what can be done to bring this matter to a finality.  Trying to position oneself one way or the other is not in the best interests of those one represents or the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_501">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing these Private Notice Questions on an important issue.  I also thank the Tánaiste for addressing the matter in the House.  Like any industrial relations dispute, it is complex.  Most of us would understand the complexities, but the House is not equipped to argue every point of it, nor would any of us wish to do so.  I do not intend to make it a party political matter because it is not one, but this dispute has a bearing on the wider economy.  There are risks to businesses and workers that are not involved in the dispute.  The unemployed are also at risk.  They would like to re-enter the workforce, but their chances of doing so would be reduced should the dispute turn out the wrong way.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">I have three questions for the Tánaiste on two core issues.  From my reading of the REA and the Labour Court's determinations, pay increases were due in April 2008 and April 2009.  We can argue about the levels, which companies should be analogue companies and so on, but the pay increases were not paid.  Any agreement would need to recognise this fact and the back-pay issue.  Electricians have received no pay increase since April 2007 whereas almost everyone in the country has received several increases, certainly if they, like Deputies, are covered by the partnership agreements.  It is important that employers acknowledge this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">It is also important that the unions acknowledge that the economy is in a different place.  Irrespective of whether we like it, wages and prices among other things must decrease if we are to save jobs, start our recovery and become competitive again.  Any agreement would need to recognise that wage rates need to stay at 2007 levels at the least.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">If the Tánaiste cares to comment, does she agree with my analysis?  Will she join me in asking both sides to moderate the dispute's temperature?  An agreement can and will be found, but there is a risk that people could become entrenched in their positions or provoke one another.  The temperature could be raised to such a degree that reaching an agreement could be more difficult.  Will the Tánaiste join me in calling on both sides to moderate the intensity of the dispute?  In particular, we should ask the employers not to put anyone on protective notice for the next few days at least and the unions not to engage in secondary picketing.  My definition of the latter is broad, that is, picketing of businesses that are not parties to the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_505">The Tánaiste does not intend to invoke the relevant section of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  If it transpires that the dispute escalates during this week or if no progress is evident later this week, the Labour Relations Commission is unable to bring the partners together and the National Implementation Body fails, will the Tánaiste be open to the possibility of using the statute to appoint an interlocutor, facilitator or inspector to analyse the situation and bring the two sides together?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_506">Given the context and principle of the Deputy's questions, I agree that it is a time for cool heads.  An escalation on either side through words or actions would not bring us to where we want to be.  I agree that the temperature in the House, although freezing thanks to the air conditioning, is calm and measured.  We would all agree that we wish to see this dispute resolved as quickly as possible.  Stating that I would invoke section 38(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 in the event of things not working out would not add to the argument.  The Deputy is correct in that there are other mechanisms by which a dispute can be referred to the Labour Court.  If we aspire towards a resolution, we should move on the basis of the instruction given to the LRC to bring both parties together.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">The intricacies of the dispute between the electrical contractors and the unions grew legs on the basis of a dispute among the employers, two sides of which went to the Labour Court.  The High Court intervened and there is an ongoing judicial review of one of the Labour Court's recommendations.  It has not been helpful that the situation has been entangled in a web of legality for a considerable period.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, was in a position to examine the issue of JLCs with employers and unions in the catering and hotel sectors.  People are still able to come together.  I will keep a watchful eye on matters as they progress and I hope that the strike will not escalate.  As the Deputy knows, hearings on injunctions are to be held tomorrow on the basis that the dispute is impacting on companies that are not necessarily involved.  We do not want to take from our international and national reputation for social partnership, which has worked well.  Let us hope that the arms of the industrial relations mechanisms will facilitate a finality to the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_509">The bottom line is that thousands of jobs are being put at risk.  Is the Tánaiste prepared to stand by while firm after firm must place its workforce on protective notice due to this industrial action?  Is she aware of the further damage being done to our already fragile international reputation?  International firms are expressing concerns about the Irish operations hit by this action.  It seriously affects our international reputation as a place of employment and location in which to set up an industry.  These issues affect the wider economy also and I therefore plead with the Minister to intervene and bring the process to a satisfactory conclusion by bringing all interested parties on board as quickly as possible.  It serves no purpose for the strike to continue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_510">A number of companies that contacted my office directly expressed grave concern over the impact of the strike on their productivity and jobs.  I am aware of this and have had discussions with a number of companies that are not in the dispute.  Two companies have decided to seek injunctions and put staff on protective notice.  Workers and all of us in this House take this matter very seriously.  It is on this basis that sustaining employment and job creation are very much objectives of the House.  As I indicated, everything that can be done through the industrial relations mechanisms will be done.</p>

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_190">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_511">The partnership process originated in the 1980s when there was a difficult industrial relations environment.  It has played a key role in dealing with a number of issues.  Has the Minister spoken, directly or indirectly, to representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or the Construction Industry Federation to ensure a resolution to the dispute sooner rather than later?  As we all know, there will be one when people talk face to face.  This will bring some direction to the process in the shorter rather than the medium term.  The dispute will probably be resolved in the medium term but we need a resolution in the shorter term.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether she will pursue discussions to ensure talks continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">I appeal to everybody involved to moderate their positions.  It is important to acknowledge that if there is an REA, with associated complexities, it must be borne in mind.  In the context of the new industrial relations (amendment) Bill, it is important that REAs be simplified and made more focused.  They should not have analogues and outdated concepts that can lead to ambiguity.  Let us have straightforward agreements such that if I am due 10%, I can say I am due that amount without somebody arguing I am misinterpreting the matter and am due 6%.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">I do not want to see employers trying at every opportunity to emasculate those with REAs, which agreements serve a purpose.  There is a feeling that their doing so is just the first port of call in accelerating a race to the bottom.  We cannot tolerate that either.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_191" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_514">I do not disagree with that view and we do not want a race to the bottom.  However, the simplification of the REA is very important and will provide greater clarity.  That will be the next step.  I am sure both parties would like a resolution in this regard and I am not aware of people being against simplification.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">I have not been in direct contact with either party in the dispute but I have been in contact with them through the Labour Relations Commission.  I have deemed this mechanism the most appropriate but I will keep the matter under review.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_192">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_516">I concur with Deputy Penrose in that the REA-ERO system needs to be simplified, delineated and modernised.  I was interested to note some of the aspects of the REA for the electrical contractors.  One part stipulates what tools can and cannot be used.  It is extraordinary to state in law the tools that can and cannot be used in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">Another part of the agreement requires that everyone in the State who is employed as an electrician must be a member of the Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union.  This is wrong because, although people should have the right to join a union and unions have the right to be recognised, nobody should be prevented from working in any industry if he is not a member of a union.  I was surprised to see this is the law of the land.  If there is a right to union recognition and collective bargaining, there should also be the right not to be the member of a union if one does not wish to join.  One should not be barred from the workplace because one does not have a union card.  The law effects such a bar, which is extraordinary.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">Will the Minister and all Members join me in asking both sides to de-escalate the dispute?  In this regard, we must ask employers not to put anyone on protective notice and ask the unions not to engage in the secondary picketing of businesses that are not party to this dispute and not signatories to the REA.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_519">It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the decision to be made tomorrow on Diageo given that a temporary injunction has been granted.  However, we desire a de-escalation of the entire dispute and that people on both sides step down such that the Labour Relations Commission can mediate.  I hope this will occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">The simplification of REAs and EROs will be discussed in the context of the industrial relations Bill.  Having listened to discussions in the House over the past year on all industrial relations legislation, I noted many Members forgot about the role of this House.  My clear intention is to enhance the scrutiny role of the House in respect of a number of labour relations mechanisms and instruments.  This is appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">Many REAs and EROs achieve what would be regarded as the right thing in that they exist to protect employees.  Equally, they protect employers against people who do not participate in the agreements and who are undermining or undercutting them.  There are two sides to the argument.  During the era of the Celtic tiger, people did not have to familiarise themselves with industrial relations law — we might all be to blame for this.  Since no major industrial relations issues arose, people were not aware or chose not to be aware of some of the instruments that exist.  This point was part of the dispute with the electricians.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, was very anxious to modernise the industrial relations instruments to reflect contemporary reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">We have had discussions in the House on the joint labour committee for catering.  There was a difference between Dún Laoghaire, Dublin city and the rest of the country but we have been able to bring them together, which has proven to be important.  The same applies to the hotels sector.  As Members have stated, we must modernise agreements such that they reflect modern realities and perhaps provide some flexibility on both sides such that if people come together they can change based on those realities.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">From all that has been said by the spokespersons and other Deputies, I gather we are <i>ad idem</i> in our desire to resolve this matter immediately.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_524">Does the Minister agree that this dispute, if allowed to escalate, could have a seriously negative impact on the entire economy during a very sensitive time?  Does she agree it is imperative not only that both sides stand down at this stage to enable negotiation at the various levels to which she and others have referred but also that she use all mechanisms available to her to intervene in the dispute a positive way, if necessary?  This would ensure that no message is given to the various sectors to the effect that a matter such as the one under discussion can be allowed to escalate and cause obvious devastation for the economy as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">In supporting the points made by other Deputies, I ask the Minister not to be afraid to take any action that must be taken in the national interest, particularly now, to ensure the issues that have caused the dispute are dealt with satisfactorily.  One way to do that is through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill.  Surely there has been ample time to anticipate and address in the Bill the type of problem that has arisen.  Did the Minister know for some time that this dispute was likely to arise and was any action taken in anticipation of it?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_195" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_526">This difficulty between the employers has been going on for some time and has been dragged through judicial review and through the High Court and the Labour Court.  There was a hearing at the beginning of the year on whether the registered employment agreement should be removed or amended, which took some time.  The Labour Court made its determination and the majority agreed that we had to move on from several of the issues it raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">It was clear following the discussion with the National Implementation Body on Friday that people were too far apart, as the Labour Relations Commission had indicated.  The mechanisms available then could not bring the two parties together.  Sometimes strike action is inevitable.  I do not wish to fuel public opinion on whether it is right or wrong.  I agree that it is of grave concern to us all.  We also agree, in recognition of the voluntary nature of our industrial relations mechanism, that it is a matter of people coming together.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">We will get through this impasse by resolution rather than diktat.  Although the labour relations mechanisms have not so far been able to resolve it we can reinstigate them and bring the parties together.  This will be a matter for both parties who will have to come together and reach agreement.  Any escalation of this will be detrimental and it will be more difficult to pull back.  We must avoid an escalation and would like to see a resolution.</p>

This is the middle of the tourism season and if this is allowed to continue it will have a devastating effect on the tourism industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_537">I do not oppose this amendment but I require some clarification from the Minister.  The amendment refers to section 70 of the 2006 Act which was debated at length in the last Dáil.  How many cases have been brought referring to this section?  What were the difficulties with the section that gave rise to this amendment?</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Section 70 of the original Act described a criminal organisation as:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_539">a structured group, however organised,that—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_540">(<i>a</i>) is composed of 3 or more persons acting in concert,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_541">(<i>b</i>) is established over a period of time,</p>

          <p eId="para_544">Why is it necessary to add to the definition?  Where stands the interpretation of section 70?  When was it brought into force?  When was it referred to in criminal trials and how many times?  Does the Minister regard section 70 as successful in bringing gangland figures to justice, which he has often stated as the aim of this legislation?  I do not wish to oppose the amendment but do wish to ascertain the rationale behind it.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">I do not wish to take up too much of the precious time that we have to debate this Bill but I have the same questions as Deputy Charles Flanagan.  I hope that we will receive answers because I considered this at length but I am not sure that I can see the difference.  Is the nuanced difference being imported into this Bill because the previous definition did not work?  Has this section never been resorted to in order to put gang leaders behind bars and will the minimal changes made here transform that picture?</p>
          <p eId="para_546">One of the big difficulties, which has been accelerating since the former Deputy Michael McDowell became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that we have had criminal justice Bill after criminal justice Bill and yet whole sections of legislation have never been used.  It is puzzling to hear Government Deputies and the Minister himself, on occasion, suggesting that the reason thugs and crime bosses are on our streets is a gap in the law or a shortage of legislation.  To the rest of us it is about a gap in enforcement, for whatever reason, such as the resourcing of the Garda Síochána in electronic tools etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I find it difficult to determine the difference between this and what we did in the 2006 Bill.  How will this work when the Minister has not bothered to invoke the 2006 Act in thisregard?</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_203" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_548">The revised definition of organised crime is simpler.  The notion of the period of time contained in the 2006 Act has been removed and it is also now clear that it is enough for two persons to act in concert rather than three persons, as before.  It is no longer necessary to show that the commission of a serious offence was to obtain a financial or material benefit.  For example, directing the intimidation of a witness or a juror without proving financial benefit would be encompassed by the new definition but not by the old one.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I understand there has been one successful prosecution since the commencement of this suite of legislation regarding organised crime in the 2006 Act.  The person in question pleaded guilty.  When we considered this legislation in the context of the aftermath of the two recent murders of Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins, one factor emerged strongly from the advice we received.  We provide the legislation in this House but the Director of Public Prosecutions, based on the evidence garnered by the Garda Síochána, directs what sections are to be used.  I have no say as to whether a prosecution should be taken under section 70, or any other section, of the 2006 Act.  It is worth emphasising that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Since the passing of the suite of legislation related to organised gang crime, the issue of participation in particular of a gangland organisation has proven difficult.  It has not been used as often as this House would have liked.  In the revised definition, we have made it simpler and easier to prove participation in a gang.  Coupled with the surveillance legislation which I hope will be passed, the Garda can use both pieces of legislation in a better way to prove participation or the overall involvement in organised gang crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">This was an effort to simplify the process and to make it somewhat easier to ground a prosecution.  Time will tell on this and given that we have built into the legislation an annual review, the House may revisit the issue to see if it has been successful.  This House has moved on a number of occasions to change legislation as events unfolded.  We did that in the case of mandatory sentencing for drug offences, as the Oireachtas came back on three occasions recently to amend legislation and to give a strong signal on the gravity of the serious offences relating to drug crime.  That is the rationale behind this definition and I thank Deputies for their acceptance that this is necessary.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_552">I am not opposing every section but I oppose the Bill as a whole.  Although action is required, I do not believe the Bill is required in its entirety, particularly with the method by which it has been introduced without the normal structured debate.  Such debate would allow time between stages for all those willing to participate to regroup and to reconsider the matter having assessed information from the Minister, or in the Minister's case from the Deputies.  That time has not been made available and while the Minister has said this is urgent and the increase in the rate of gangland crime requires action, this is not the right step at the right time, particularly in regard to this section, which deals with the definition of a criminal organisation contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Minister is misleading the public into thinking that this section is either necessary or useful in tackling gangland crime.  The definition is almost identical to that in the 2006 Act and other Deputies have spoken about that.  I stand to be corrected, as I heard the Minister say there was one conviction, but I was led to believe there were no convictions.  I do not know how this change will make the process any easier, less complicated or more effective given the existing legislation from 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I argued on Committee Stage of the 2006 Bill and warned that the definition to be introduced at that time would be unworkable, and what has transpired since seems to have proved that.  I contended that any effort to use it would eventually lead to a legal challenge.  I do not encourage people to challenge the 2006 Act but the 1937 Constitution demands certainty in law, and the European Convention on Human Rights demands foreseeability in law.  The definition introduced in the 2006 Bill and now being slightly amended is loose and vague.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The then Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, was in charge of the 2006 Bill and we discussed during the long debate on Committee Stage the ability of legislation to define a loose group of people which did not necessarily have a hierarchical structure or constitution and were not bound by a loyalty.  People could be in one group on one day and in another by the next day.  We debated how legislation would deal with the issue of an organisation not having a formal structure.  The Minister at the time admitted the dangers on Committee Stage but continued with the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I recall at the time highlighting a case from the Supreme Court in British Columbia, as that type of definition had been used in Canada.  The then Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform based the part of the 2006 Act which deals with this issue on the definition contained in the Canadian criminal code.  That definition was eventually found to be in violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">We are all aware of the activities of the various criminal gangs.  The constituency I represent is still greatly affected by the activities of such gangs, particularly in the context of their supplying illegal drugs.  It appears that even the Garda Síochána cannot admit that these are criminal gangs.  A senior officer from Crumlin addressed a conference recently and stated that, despite the fact that 13 people have been killed, there is no feud in the Crumlin-Drimnagh area.  It is strange the Garda cannot seem to see that two feuding gangs are operating in the area.  It is obvious that a series of vicious, premeditated crimes have been carried out by a group of individuals acting in concert.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">There is a great deal of existing legislation which could be usefully employed in the area to which I refer.  The difficulty is that action was not taken in the past.  The reason for this lack of action has sometimes been that gardaí in the area did not have access to either the intelligence necessary or the resources required to properly target and tackle the individuals who have destroyed communities or held them to ransom.  Most of the wealth of these individuals comes from the drugs trade.  They also have at their disposal vast quantities of weapons with which they can intimidate communities.  Such weapons enter the country in virtually every shipment of drugs that arrives here.  In another era, the Provisional IRA might have been proud of some of these weapons.  However, if one considers the type and amount of them that the gangs possess, it is clear that the only purpose to which they can be put is to intimidate and hold communities to ransom.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The only way to deal with the availability of these weapons is to tackle the drugs trade and to intercept drug shipments entering the country.  That is why I supported the passage of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 last week.  I am of the view that the Garda Síochána should be provided with proper resources.  The roll-out of the radio system which it has long been demanding should be accelerated and the freeze on recruitment and promotion should be lifted in order that there will be nothing to hamper the force in carrying out undercover investigations against the drugs gangs in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">If one asks the Garda authorities, they will indicate that the most effective units within the force are the drugs units.  Given that this is the case, the number of these units must be increased and additional resources must be provided in order that the drugs trade might be destroyed and the profits being used by these gangs to keep some of their associates in line or which are encouraging certain individuals to feud with each other be removed.  As stated previously, we should see this as a national crisis and we should get all hands on deck in order to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I am opposed to section 3 because I cannot see the benefit of changing the existing definition, particularly because it has not worked and is not likely to.</p>

I am of the view that it may allow us to avoid the need for juries or witnesses in certain instances.

That is why my party has tabled amendment No. 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Is it correct that on the opinion evidence of a chief superintendent — as suggested in amendment No. 5 — and surveillance evidence provided, a prosecution could take place under a judge in the Special Criminal Court?  In such circumstances, there would be no need for either a jury or other witnesses.  That is a key point in the context of using the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, when enacted, and this legislation in the fight against crime.  Will the Minister clarify the position in respect of this matter, which relates to the structure of gangs?</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_212" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_570">I will reply first in respect of the matter raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  There has been a great deal of misinformation regarding what a later section provides in respect of expert evidence on the existence of gangs.  In addition, a number of individuals have misconstrued the position in this regard.  Such evidence does not in any way go to the guilt of a person.  It is merely evidence provided by a garda — perhaps an officer of ordinary rank — who would have knowledge or information in respect of the existence of a gang in a particular area.  However, this is not opinion evidence that can be used to attribute guilt of a person against whom charges have been brought.  There has been a misconception in respect of this matter and some of the amendments that have been tabled betray a misunderstanding of what constitutes expert evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">As matters stand, there are no provisions in existing legislation or in that before the House which would allow opinion evidence — allied to surveillance evidence — to be given by a chief superintendent in respect of someone directing a criminal gang.  Such a provision does exist in respect of those who direct terrorist organisations but we have not gone that far in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Deputy Ó Snodaigh is opposed to both the section and the Bill.  Following the murder of Shane Geoghegan, I was criticised for not taking sufficient action.  I am in possession of quotes relating to that matter which were made by various people, both inside and outside the House.  On 13 November 2008, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan stated in the Dáil that "people want us to do whatever is necessary to smash these gangs".  She went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_573">The overall message that must emanate from this House is that we are determined to treat this matter [gangland crime in Limerick] with urgency.  I am not sure that sense of urgency is evident in [any]one on the Government side ...  Every measure . . . should be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">On 11 November 2008, Deputy Gilmore stated in the Dáil: "The public wants to get a sense that these gangs will be smashed."  He then stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_575">We do not want to hear the reasons certain things cannot be done.  We need to see, led by Government, which my party will support in this, definitive measures taken that will solve and address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Last week on Second Stage, I quoted Deputy Rabbitte's comments, made after the Shane Geoghegan murder but before that of Roy Collins, in which he stated there must come a tipping point.  He went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_577">I acknowledge that these are exceptional powers that the Dáil has now been asked to provide to the gardaí, but, subject to proper oversight, they are necessary to deal with the exceptional threat being posed by armed criminal gangs, which have claimed 11 victims so far this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I agree with the Deputy.  Deputy Kenny also stated: "Treating them with an easy hand and a bland response is not good enough." He also said: "The Government response to this latest atrocity has been too bland and too easy." He then stated: "This is a war; win it."  I have to hand copious other quotations from Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">At the time, I believed we had in place all the requisite legislation and resources.  On the issue of resources, I have seen allegations in the media recently that I wish to nail to the effect that the Garda Síochána does not have the requisite resources.  I assure the House that it does and that every available resource will be made available to it.  The Garda Síochána will get everything it seeks in respect of this issue of gangland crime, regardless of whether it is in Limerick or anywhere else on this island.  The Garda Síochána has all the resources it requires and will receive more if it requires more.  I wish to nail that allegation on the head.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Moreover, I have not picked this legislation out of the sky.  I refer to the murder of Roy Collins and wish to emphasise a point because I read an article in a newspaper during the week in which it was stated that Roy Collins was killed because he was a witness in a court case.  However, he was not a witness.  He was killed because he was the son of a witness in a court case, that is, someone who was doing his duty.  I thought long and hard after the murder of Roy Collins and discussed it initially with the Garda Commissioner at the funeral of the garda who was killed in a car crash in County Donegal.  Consequently, I asked that we should meet the Attorney General within a couple of days, which we did.  At that time, I clearly indicated publicly that I intended to consider the types of measures that previously had been applied to paramilitary organisations and was giving strong consideration to applying them in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Two months ago, on 13 May, I issued a detailed statement as to what was being proposed in this Bill.  As the contents of that detailed statement have been replicated in the Bill before the House, I reject any suggestion that it has been plucked out of the sky or that Members have been given insufficient time.  The only way in which it differs from the contents of the statement issued on 13 May is that the issue of membership of a criminal gang has been removed, due to the difficulty of producing evidence and proving in court the membership of a criminal gang.  Instead, the offence of directing a criminal gang has been proposed.  Moreover, it is a requirement, under the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, to have in our legislative suite an offence against directing a criminal organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">We also considered the issue under discussion by Members at present in respect of this amendment and section, namely, how to make easier the proving of participation in a criminal organisation.  I believe the Government discussed this issue at least three times in recent weeks before publishing the legislation.  The Government discussed it at length with the Attorney General and with the Garda Commissioner's management team to ensure that it got this right.  That is the reason each section addresses particular issues that have come to the Government's attention.  While I have heard people commenting to the effect that this constitutes a colossal change in legislation, that is not the case.  Much of what I have proposed is already contained in existing legislation and, on examination, people will find this is not a seismic change in respect of the manner in which such offences will be tried.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Government believes strongly that the Oireachtas must send a strong signal to these criminal gangs that they cannot usurp the State or the people who live in it, which is what they are doing at present on a daily basis in places such as Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere.  I referred during the Second Stage debate to a convention that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform generally is constrained in what he or she can say regarding issues of which he or she has knowledge on foot of discussions with the Garda Commissioner and his team.  However, when the Garda Commissioner tells the Government that, given the Garda's experience in recent years, it is necessary to introduce some of the issues that are being dealt with in this Bill, I disagree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  Moreover, this does not simply pertain to the issue of scheduling offences but also to other issues pertinent to this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">One is not obliged to take into account either my comments or those of the Garda Commissioner to the Government on the necessity for these changes.  One need only listen to statements on RTE by people such as the Limerick State solicitor, Mr. Michael Murray.  Anyone who missed his appearance on "The Week in Politics" should listen to his comments in respect of what is going on regarding the intimidation of juries in Limerick and other issues to which he referred.  Moreover, during the Second Stage debate, two Deputies from this side of the House, namely, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, were absolutely adamant about the necessity for this legislation on the basis of their own personal knowledge.  They stated that their constituents were coming to their clinics in fear, having received a summons regarding jury service in the Limerick area.  Undoubtedly, other Deputies from the Limerick area would be able to provide similar testimony.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">This legislation is absolutely necessary.  It is necessary to pass the legislation before the House rises in order that, coupled with the surveillance legislation, the Garda Síochána can have the tools to bring these people to justice.  I refer to the sentiments Members expressed in November 2008 after the shameful murder of Shane Geoghegan.  Subsequently, a relation of someone who gave evidence as a witness in a trial was murdered four years after the event.  Does anyone for a minute suggest that those involved in organised crime gangs would make any distinction between a witness and a juror?  It would be utterly naïve for anyone to suggest this of such gangs, particularly in respect of the new offences proposed in this Bill.  I refer to the offence of directing, which pertains to the very people who do not pull the trigger but who direct patsies to shoot people on orders.  When referring to the awful killing of Shane Geoghegan during the Second Stage debate, the Minister, Deputy Willie O'Dea, suggested the attackers even had a doubt as to the identity of the person they were killing, which demonstrates the level to which such people will go.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I repeat to Members that the Government does not take this matter lightly.  However, it believes its measures are proportionate and reasonable.  I have no doubt but that it will make the prosecution of criminal gangs easier.  I believe it will do what Deputies such as Deputy Gilmore and others eloquently stated in the House on occasion on the necessity to take those measures that Members might not tolerate in normal times.</p>

I do not like the word "scum" but these people are the scum of the earth.  We are at one in this House in wanting to take them off our streets but that is not the issue here.

All the Minister said was that it would be folly to seek to draw distinctions.  There is a major distinction because at the Special Criminal Court one must still provide witnesses.  The Minister invited Members to watch "The Week in Politics" on Sunday night, when the State solicitor from Limerick, Mr. Michael Murray, appeared.  What the Minister quoted does not say what the Minister suggested.  Mr. Murray was confronted by a live video of Deputy Willie O'Dea, admittedly a challenge at any time, and asked if he agreed with him.  He replied:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_595">The Minister is well known for walking the streets of Limerick and is out every given hour that he has at the weekends.  I am not going to contradict the Minister because, in fairness to him, if anybody knows what is going on on the streets of Limerick, he does.  I cannot say I have any evidence of widespread intimidation.[. . .]  I have not seen a lot of evidence of intimidation of jurors.  In the recent past I have come across one case where a  jury was quite clearly frightened and had been intimidated.  As a result of that I asked the gardaí to investigate the matter.</p>

The Minister writes:</p>

If the Minister had any evidence of interference with jurors, he would have included it in that letter to Deputy Flanagan.  The Minister does not have any evidence.  He says the statistics do not exist and I suggest that the reason they do not exist is because there is none.  Mr. Justice Paul Carney is the most senior, experienced judge in the criminal courts.  Those of us on these benches want to see these thugs made amenable to the law.  If the Minister has evidence that there is intimidation of juries, I will withdraw my opposition to that section.  I have made it plain that we do not oppose any measures, within the law, designed to combat organised crime.  The issue is whether the Minister can establish that in this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The Minister should remember that he dodged the issue on "Morning Ireland" and that he allied witnesses and jurors into the same sentence on every opportunity he has been given to talk about this.  As a lawyer, the Minister knows the difference but he knows that there are people outside the House who do not readily pick up on the difference.  As a result, we are dealing with something about which we do not have evidence.  There is no merit in trying to suggest that the House is divided or that there is any party or Member not dedicated to the rule of law and putting gangsters behind bars.  We want to do so with the most effective measures available to us.  That is the only issue.  If the Minister can rewrite the letter he wrote to Deputy Flanagan and provide us with the evidence, I am prepared to change my mind.</p>

This is a pity because time is of the essence if we are to give this Bill appropriate scrutiny.  I regret that the Minister started off with a general debate and a high degree of party political content.  This is a subversion of the parliamentary process.  Nobody accused the Minister of plucking this legislation from the sky.  I never heard that comment, other than from the Minister.  What I said is that we are charged with dealing with this legislation on a line by line basis because it is complex, in spite of what the Minister suggests.  The reason we are amending section 75 on the 2006 Act is because of complexity, difficulty and the fact that we did not get it right in 2006 and 2007.  That is the reason we are revisiting this, because of failures of Government in the past that the Minister is repeating this evening.  The Minister put forward a political smokescreen to the effect that Members are against dealing with gangland figures.</p>

I cannot recall anything in recent times that had such an impact as the findings of the Ryan commission.  It shocked a nation that thought it had got beyond being shocked.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The 43 conclusions in the executive summary are, frankly, quite unreal and horrific when one reads them in the cold light of day, but to hear the anguished voices of those people who are the subjects of the testimony that they gave and to listen to their stories makes us all ashamed.  Therefore, it puts upon all of us an obligation to listen to, reach out and, where possible, respond to many of the concerns they expressed to us in the light of the findings of the report, its 43 conclusions, and the 21 recommendations it made at the end of five volumes of testimony and analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Labour Party has studied the Ryan report and its recommendations.  We have listened to the survivors, and to the children of those who were sent to these institutions and who are no longer alive.  There were some issues which were outside the scope of the original legislation, the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, which now need to be addressed.  It is for this reason that we have published our Bill, the Institutional Child Abuse Bill 2009, to make amends to the victims of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House.  We earnestly hope the Bill will not be opposed by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  We do not wish to divide the House on this issue.  There are many ways in which the Bill can be taken on board.  We all know the fate of Private Members' Bills that are accepted on Second Stage; some of them surface in due course amended by the Government of the day and are enacted, others have to linger but at least they have the credibility of not being voted down.  I know the vote will not take place until tomorrow evening but I understand that it is the intention of the Government as of now to vote it down.  In the spirit of comradeship I earnestly ask the Minister to think again about that course of action.  We owe it to ourselves and the victims throughout the country, some of whom are in the Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">With regard to what the Bill proposes to do, we have identified seven areas in which we believe action is necessary.  The first is that the Bill would expand the definitions of "child" and "institution" so that no victim of abuse is denied justice through the redress board.  A small but substantial number of people were previously excluded from the redress board because of the wording of the 2002 Act.  This change would ensure that this would no longer be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The second is that the Bill would expand the definitions of "child" and "institution" which would necessitate a new time period for new applications to the redress board.  It would change the definition of adult from the age of 21 to the age of 18.  People were deemed to be children during the time they were incarcerated in these institutions because they were under the age of 21 but because we moved the voting age and other definitions of childhood and adulthood they were no longer retrospectively deemed to be children even though at that point in time they were so deemed.  That is an anomaly that needs to be addressed and our Bill addresses it.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The third is that the Bill would abolish the obligation of secrecy which effectively prohibits applicants to the redress board from talking about their childhood and time in the institutions.  My God, what type of a country does the Government think we live in that one cannot talk about one's childhood or one's experience in institutions?  That is straight out of Tiananmen Square in the People's Republic of China or Russia or another dictatorial state.  That citizens of this republic are prohibited by law from talking about their childhood or their time in Irish institutions has no place in Irish legislation and it should be reformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The fourth is that the Bill proposes that persons who were detained in reformatory schools under criminal convictions must be treated for all purposes in law as not guilty of an offence and their records will be wiped clean.  This is important for a variety of reasons and it is important that we understand what we are trying to do.  We cannot, nor will we try to, rewrite history; the conclusions and records of the courts must stand for future generations to see what shame we brought upon ourselves in the name of the Irish republic.  The Labour Party does not propose to retrospectively correct the historical record but we are stating that we would amend the impact of that historical record to the point that as and from the enactment of the Bill, no person so charged, so recorded, so convicted and so dispersed from a court to an institution would be deemed then or now to have been a criminal irrespective of what the historical record said.  That is what we seek; it is a cultural change and not a factual change.  It is a just change and we should do it without altering the historical record and that record is itself important.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I have not read all five volumes because, quite frankly, I do not know whether I have the courage or the capacity to do so, but the bits I have read are such that no matter how horrific they are, the last thing that should ever happen to them is that they be destroyed.  The last thing that should ever occur to them is that they disappear as some files have disappeared in the Department of Education and Science.  The last thing that this republic should ever be able to say is that not only did we abuse those victims but that we buried their past as well.  Every record, testimony and word of anguish that carefully and painfully described the system that was constructed should in whatever way at least be preserved; let it be for other people and other generations to decide how best to convey them.  No survivor or child of a survivor should be able to say that there is no record of what they said or experienced.  It would be like having a relative with no grave or like having somebody among the disappeared because the Minister would allow the records of their testimony to be destroyed.  It is the Minister who has that power and we want it to be shared with the House to ensure that no such destruction can take place unless the House agrees to it and I do not think it would.  That is the fifth proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The sixth proposal made by the Bill is to open up the 2002 indemnity deal to freedom of information requests.  All legal privilege and confidentiality would be waived by the State if the Bill is passed.  This was part of the sordid deal between contracting parties as it passed from Ms Justice Laffoy to Mr. Justice Ryan.  It was a shoddy deal and it should be removed.  If it is removed it would allow the records of the 2002 indemnity agreement with the 18 religious teaching orders to be published in full.  The culture of deferment in the Department of Education and Science to which the third conclusion of the executive summary refers is a thing of the past.  It is healthy that it should be buried in the past because it will not inform any citizen of the republic in the future of the State as we march into this century.  It would guarantee that any proposed amendment to the indemnity deal would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and subject to their approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The seventh key proposal of the legislation will enable an audit of the assets of the religious orders.  The Bill confers power on the Government to appoint an auditor to examine the financial affairs of the 18 religious orders who signed the 2002 indemnity agreement.  This will allow the Government to assess the true wealth of the religious orders for future renegotiation of the 2002 agreement.  It was, perhaps, my colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who, on behalf of the Labour Party and the citizens of this Republic, pioneered the questioning on the shoddy deal done in secret by former Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, and the then Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, now since retired.  I presume I can refer to him by name — Mr. Dennehy.  If we can refer by name to T.K. Whitaker, we can refer to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">That was a shoddy deal.  While it was not easy to calculate what the approximate cost might be, the Department of Finance suggested the burden should be shared evenly, 50:50.  However, we got a deal that allocated 10% of the burden to the religious orders and 90% to the taxpayer.  That deal must be reopened.  I understand the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science met with the representatives of the 18 religious orders after the debate on the Ryan report some weeks ago and that a request has been made to reopen the deal.  I hope the Minister will address that matter in his response to this debate and confirm to the House my understanding, as reported in the media, that the Taoiseach requested an audit to be undertaken by the religious congregations so as to see what contribution they can make from their own resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I wish to say something in this regard.  I am the product of the religious teaching orders.  I am a proud graduate of the wonderful education I got from the Holy Ghost Fathers in St. Michael's School and Blackrock College.  I have never resiled from that.  To my dying days, I will be eternally grateful for the love, affection, erudition, leadership and education I got from those men.  Neither I nor the Labour Party have any desire to impoverish the religious teaching orders.  God knows, they are now at a stage in their lives, having made an incredible contribution to this country, where their major concern is the care of the elderly in their communities.  They do not have children or grandchildren who can provide for their nursing home care and do not have the support we have in old age or that we give to our parents in old age.  However, they are entitled to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">In so far as they need resources for decent dignity in their declining years — such as we would want for our own parents, uncles and aunts — they should have them, but let them have them at the expense of the taxpayer and not through the sale and dispersal of the educational infrastructure and other institutions and buildings they have across the country.  Let not the so-called financial and legal advisers advise them to dispose of their assets so that they can care for the sick and elderly in their communities to whom they have an obligation.  Let that not be the outcome.  If there are spare resources, let them come into the pot towards the 50:50 deal, but if there are not such resources — I am open on the question, but I suspect there are not — let us not allow the sale of infrastructure paid for by taxpayers and Catholic citizens, in the main, who contributed voluntarily to the construction of these edifices over the past 100 years or so.  That is not what the Labour Party is about nor is it what I am about.  This is public infrastructure that belongs to the community and should not be allowed disappear.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The reason I am so passionate about this — the Minister has heard me say this before — is that two secondary schools in the constituency of Dublin South-East under the control of religious teaching orders disappeared without any reference to the parents or anyone involved.  There was minimal notice to the teachers and no forward planning for the parents of those children.  One primary school under religious order control and two primary schools under diocesan control have also disappeared.  They closed these schools for their own reasons.  We understand the reasons, but such reasons are no longer sufficient when we have 500,000 primary school children in our system and another 100,000 expected within ten years.  We cannot allow such infrastructure to disappear and that is the reason I have been so strong on this argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I want to repeat that I am the product of a fine education from those religious teaching orders.  I salute them and am thankful for my education.  This Bill is not about some kind of vindictive chase of the religious orders to try to impoverish them, but about enriching our community and celebrating the contribution the majority of them have made to our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Some issues have been brought to our attention, including the experience of women who were in the Magdalene laundries.  The Bill does not address that issue and some of my colleagues will explain the technical and legal reasons for that later.  That is not to say their experience was not horrendous.  Theirs is a past that should not be buried, but there are reasons and explanations that time prevents me from elaborating upon as to why the Bill does not include them.  It was not just the State and religious teaching orders who were involved.  There was a culture in some of our families, from wherever it originated, that denied the existence of daughters who became pregnant outside of marriage.  They were hunted out of their homes and, in some cases, out of the country.  I am ashamed of that.  We should all be ashamed of it.  We have addressed it now, but that did not happen for some people born here and they suffered a great hurt as a result.  We all know that.  I do not know if legislation along the lines of the redress board legislation can deal with that.  Nevertheless, we should recognise it did happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">One of the first recommendations in the executive summary of the Ryan report was there should be a monument.  That does not go far enough.  There should be a museum.  We should have a museum that will contain the records, the history, the experience, the voices and the sounds of the victims so that they can explain why, having lost their childhoods, they could never behave and live as full adults towards their own children.  We should have a museum so that grandchildren can understand why their grandmother or grandfather were not as others were or why they had black days that were inexplicable to a young child.  We need that permanent memory from the past to be kept in such a museum so that we never allow this abuse occur again, because forgetfulness is the enemy of such a surety for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">I have a suggestion for the House.  As part of their contribution to the 10% contribution to the State, the Christian Brothers handed over the property of Coláiste Mhuire in Parnell Square.  That property is currently under the management of the OPW, but no use has been found for it.  The property is beside the Hugh Lane Gallery and across from the Garden of Remembrance — part of the cultural sector of Dublin city.  There, between the splendour of the art collection of the Hugh Lane Gallery and the inspirational heroism and martyrdom of the 1916 insurrection, we should have a museum for ourselves about ourselves so that our future children will realise this was not some foreign invasion, these were not the Vikings nor some Anglo-Saxon invasion nor Cromwell, but us, you, me and every citizen in the country, who allowed these things to happen in our name and in our State.  Never again must this be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I would accept the proposal of a monument, but suggest it should be a museum.  We should locate that museum not somewhere down the country where it would be difficult to access, like Letterfrack or Daingean, but in the centre of our capital city, within 500 m of that icon of insurrection, the GPO, to say that, yes, we did some glorious things in this Republic, but we also did things of which we should be ashamed and which we must ensure will never occur again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_629">I commend my colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, on presenting this motion.  I support his request that the Government would consider not opposing this Bill in the House tomorrow when it comes to a vote.  It is very important that we have consensus on this issue and that there is full agreement across the Chamber and across the country so that, in particular, we learn the very painful and hard lessons of the Ryan report.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I pay due respect to Mr. Justice Ryan and, before him, Ms Justice Laffoy, for the work they did.  I accessed the entire series of volumes in the Oireachtas Library.  We have a duty as Members of this House to read, in so far as we can, the Ryan report, although the extraordinary effect it has makes it very difficult to read.  However, as a nation, we have to absorb it and take it in.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">That Deputy Quinn referred so often in his contribution to the Republic is important.  We are citizens of a Republic.  This is about the voice of the people, and it is about allowing that voice to be heard and learning the lessons.  I would endorse his proposal that we need a museum.  We need to take in as a nation what actually happened in those institutions in the past, in our name.  It was with the collusion of many of the most respected and prized institutions of our State that those things were done to those children, but these matters were left locked away in circles of darkness that nobody penetrated at that time.  The door has now been thrown open and the information is out in the public arena.  We have to learn from this and ensure this kind of thing can never happen in our names again.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I was not in this House a very long time when the initial apology was made by the then Taoiseach in May 1999, more than ten years ago.  Right across the House and across the State, there was a sense that we had to work together to address what we were beginning to learn at that time.  As a new Deputy, at the time I proposed on behalf of the Labour Party legislation to amend the Statute of Limitations in regard to the taking of civil cases for people who were victims of institutional abuse.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the current Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O'Donoghue, accepted that legislation, an Opposition Bill, and the Government of the time took it on board.  While the Government amended that Bill and we did not agree with everything it finally contained, at least there was at that time a spirit of generosity and of people working together on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The various parts of the Bill we put forward tonight on behalf of the Labour Party are put forward as part of the unfinished business of the work of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the other elements that have gone with them.  They concern omissions and areas which the people in the Visitors Gallery and others have told us were omissions in what has been done since 1999, and which need to be addressed.  For example, the people now in England, who went away after they got out of those institutions did so because this country had no place for them and had ruined their lives.  If those people did not know in time to apply to the redress board, surely they should not be excluded from whatever recompense is now belatedly available to them, which will never give them back their lives or their childhoods.  There is also the issue of the people who were in other institutions not listed on the Schedule that was initially put forward and later amended, such as the Regina Coeli hostel, which was highlighted by Marie Therese O'Loughlin outside this House, and the Morning Star hostel.  There is also Derek Linster, who highlighted the institutions that were not Catholic which were excluded, and there are others.  People were excluded because of their age.  There are many people who are currently excluded from redress who should not be excluded, including those from the Magdalene laundries.  This should be an all-inclusive provision and whatever gaps exist must be filled.  We cannot leave this as unfinished business.  We must ensure we respond fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I spoke last week in a debate on Michael Shine, another case which has emerged in regard to abuse of children — there are others, such as the case of the Brothers of Charity in Galway, which have also not been fully investigated.  I made the point in that debate that people must have the opportunity to make their cases, to be heard, to be listened to and to be believed as credible people when they are telling their stories.  What happened in the past was that they were not believed because they were people of no power.  There were very powerful people in our society who said they should not be believed and it was all swept under the carpet.  We must ensure these people are listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">If he does not mind me using his name, I pointed last week to the difference in the way in which John Kelly spoke on television after he was invited to Áras an Uachtaráin to have a validation of what happened to the victims of abuse by the highest office in the land, ten years after all of this came about.  We saw this also during the march that came to Leinster House some weeks ago.  This was the final recognition that people were telling the truth, that these things did happen, that they were wrong and that the State acknowledges they were wrong.  While I hope he will forgive me for saying it, the difference in what this has done for somebody who has gone through the process of fighting and ensuring there is finally an acceptance that this happened, including in the highest offices of the State, is huge.  We owe it to every single citizen of our country, many of whom had to go outside the country to find lives for themselves, to include them in this process, which must have that all-inclusive nature.  We should not divide on this very important issue in the House tomorrow, and I appeal to the Government not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">With regard to the setting up of a trust and to the institutions providing appropriate recompense in terms of the balance between what the State pays and what the institutions pay, this is not about some kind of retribution on the institutions — it is about fairness.  The proposal at the time from the Department of Finance that it should be apportioned roughly 50:50 between the State and the institutions where the abuse was perpetrated obviously did not come about because of the indemnity deal that was made, or the way in which it was made.  That issue must be addressed and it must be done in an open and public way.  Again, this is catered for in terms of ensuring matters of this nature are subject to freedom of information.  I hope the Government will respond clearly about what it will do with regard to auditing the institutions, finding out what money is available and setting up a trust.  It is very important to the victims and to the survivors that this process is at arm's length from the institutions, and that it is operated by an independent trust into which the money is paid, so they have the dignity of using an independent trust as opposed to having to go again to the institutions looking for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I conclude by restating the importance of not leaving open ends in regard to this matter, which has gone on for ten years and more.  There has been at times very brave journalism and very brave people have been willing to go out there, up front, to ensure this is brought to public attention.  It needs to be fully embraced by all of the people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">We must adopt these measures to put in place the knowledge and systems to ensure this will never happen again and that we fully embrace as a people the learning process that must continue regarding these matters.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_639">I welcome the Institutional Child Abuse Bill 2009 and I commend the Labour Party on framing and introducing it under Private Members' time.  The measures in the Bill are a logical and necessary follow-up to the Ryan report.  The Bill addresses a range of outstanding issues that were crystallized by the Ryan report and that have been clearly articulated by the survivors of institutional child abuse before and after that publication.  These measures are essential if justice is to be done for those cruelly wronged by the State and the church.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">All the recommendations of the Ryan report should be implemented, a matter on which the House is already agreed.  The recommendations focus on alleviating the effects of abuse on those who suffered in the past and preventing abuse of children in care today and tomorrow.  As I stated during the Dáil debate on the Ryan report, the Government must go further.  It must address the need for truth and justice and recompense for those abused in institutions, residential, non-residential and those not covered by the Ryan report and this Bill attempts to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Justice must be done for former residents of Finglas children's centre, Scoil Ard Mhuire in Lusk, Trinity House, Trudder House and Madonna House.  I also include the Magdalen laundries and institutions established after 1970.  In the case of Trudder House, where many Traveller children were abused, there was one successful criminal prosecution.  In the case of Madonna House, there was one prosecution and an inadequate investigation but no proper support for the victims.  No survivor or victim should be left behind or left out in the cold as Marie Therese O'Loughlin was for many months outside the gates of this institution, Leinster House, on Kildare Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">We should also acknowledge that abuse in institutions run by religious bodies was not confined to the Catholic church.  Derek Leinster has highlighted the abuses he and others suffered in Bethany House, Rathgar, which was run by the Church of Ireland.  As I mentioned during the Ryan report debate, a former civil servant, Loretta Byrne, who worked in the then Department of Education tried to blow the whistle on abuse in the Finglas children's centre but was ignored.  She stated that she brought these concerns to the attention of at least three prominent Members but nothing effective was done.  I understand we know the identity of these three prominent Members.  These are very serious allegations that need to be rigorously investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I welcome especially section 1(<i>f</i>) which would lift the gagging clause contained in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  This attempts to prevent those whose cases have been before the redress board from speaking publicly about their experiences.  It is deeply ironic that legislation supposed to aid the survivors and make recompense to them should prevent them from speaking out.  For these survivors telling their story is a very important part of recovery.  For some this may involve writing accounts of their experience, creative writing, film documentaries or other creative work.  The attempt to gag these survivors should be abandoned now and the offending section should be deleted as proposed in the Bill.  I hope in the Minister’s contribution this evening he will provide confirmation of the Government’s acceptance of that and all the component parts in the legislation on Second Stage before the House.  The stigma of criminalisation has followed many of the survivors throughout their lives.  All trace of this stigma and all doubt in respect of the law must be removed and, therefore, the Government should also accept section 1(<i>g</i>) which wipes the slate clean and also prevents discrimination against people on the basis of having been in an institution.  It should not apply in respect of the record of any of these people, whose harrowing experiences are enough without adding further insult to the injury already suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Another major element of the Bill relates to the records of the redress board and the need for their preservation.  This is very important and in line with the resolution adopted unanimously by the Dáil in response to the Ryan report.  The Bill seeks to ensure that any amendments to the indemnity deal between the Government and the 18 religious orders are subject to approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is essential given the very underhand crafting of the original indemnity deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">It cannot be stressed strongly enough that children in the care of the State and children denied care because of State neglect continue to be at risk today.  Everyone here should read the minutes of the most recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on 30 June last which heard from the Ombudsman for Children and from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  The Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, expressed concern that hundreds of children continue to be at risk of abuse due to the lack of independent inspections of residential centres and hostels which house vulnerable young people.  She pointed out that the majority of almost 130 separated children seeking asylum stay in private hostels not subject to independent monitoring.  These children do not have access to an independent guardian and many separated children did not have regular access to a social worker directly allocated to them.  The Government must address this as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">From among that cadre of children some have disappeared and there is no knowledge or indication whatsoever of what became of them.  There are still hundreds of children with intellectual disabilities in residential centres not subject to any standards or inspections.  At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 30 June I raised the issue of the deaths of at least 20 children in care during the past decade, which is now the subject of an internal Health Service Executive inquiry.  The Ombudsman for Children has called for a child death review mechanism which I fully support.  I urge the Minister and the Government to accept this recommendation as a vital component in establishing the truth in respect of the death of any child in care in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The Government must also implement the first recommendation of the Monageer report and establish a 24-seven social work service.  Nothing less is acceptable or safe.  It must continue to be of concern to Members that this first recommendation was so dismissed by the Minister of State with responsibility for children on the publication of that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I urge the Government not to oppose the passage of the Second Stage of this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to allow it go forward to Committee Stage and let the Government debate it in detail with all the other representatives of this House.  We at least owe that to the people in the Gallery this evening and the countless thousands, tens of thousands generationally, who have yet to have truth and justice established in their name.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">Before I deal with the issues raised in the Labour Party's proposed Bill, it is worthwhile reflecting on the progress we have made in recognising and admitting that children in institutions were not appropriately cared for and how the Government and indeed the entire State has addressed and responded to this matter.  In 1999, the Taoiseach's apology was an admission that the State had failed in its obligations to ensure appropriate standards of care for children in these institutions.  At that time the Taoiseach also announced the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse; the establishment of a nationwide professional counselling service for the victims of childhood abuse; and legal changes relating to the taking of cases involving abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Residential Institutions Redress Board was then established under statute to provide redress to persons who had suffered abuse as children while resident in certain institutions that were subject to State inspection and regulation.  More recently, the Education Finance Board was established to provide grants to former residents and their families to allow them to access educational programmes.  The Government has accepted the 20 recommendations in the Ryan report.  Sixteen of these recommendations relate in the main to the prevention of child abuse in the future.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has been given the responsibility of bringing an implementation plan to Government by the end of this month.  The remaining four recommendations relate mainly to my Department and are placed under the heading of, to alleviate or otherwise address the effects of the abuse on those who suffered.  The Government will implement these recommendations which relate to the provision of a memorial; a review of systems to avoid future failures; the availability of education and counselling services and the continued availability of family tracing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Government is committed to the provision of funding to provide for a memorial.  Counselling services are currently available through the national counselling service.  Funding for education is currently available from the Education Finance Board. The board is funded through the allocation of €12.7 million from the cash contribution made by the religious orders.  At the end of 2008, some €7.35 million of this remained to be expended on education for former survivors and their families.  Barnardos is currently being funded to provide a family tracing service.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">My Department has convened a working group which includes departmental representatives from my Department and other relevant Departments to consider and progress all of these recommendations.  This working group will contribute to the overall implementation plan being prepared by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Since the publication of the report, the Taoiseach and Cabinet colleagues and I have met with groups representing survivors of abuse.  There have also been a number of written submissions from the survivor groups.  The issues raised by the groups are similar to but not limited to those raised in the Labour Party Bill.  The Taoiseach and Ministers have also met on two occasions with the religious congregations.  At the first meeting the Taoiseach conveyed the view of the Government and that of the wider public that further substantial contributions are required from the congregations and that the contributions need to be capable of being assessed by the public.  The Taoiseach asked the congregations to revert with proposals in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">We met with the representatives of the various religious congregations again on Wednesday, 24 June 2009.  The religious congregations reported on the progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial positions.  The congregations have been requested and are expected to submit these financial reports to the Government by mid-July.  A further meeting will be arranged with them at that stage.  The Taoiseach has stated the Government will appoint a panel of three independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and report on the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I wish to express the Government's regret that the Labour Party has chosen to act unilaterally by moving this Bill.  I believed we had a unified approach when passing the all-party motion.  I thought we would go forward together with the Dáil sitting in solidarity in the interest of the survivors.  It is regrettable that this approach was not continued as we progress through our engagement with the survivor groups and the religious congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The Government must oppose this Bill because the issues raised have not been fully considered and in some cases legal advice will need to be sought.  In addition, while I realise that costing these measures is not a simple task, it is clear that the Labour Party has not made any attempt to cost them or even consider the cost implications.  This is not to say that the Government's future decisions will be totally dependent on the financial implications but we must at all times consider the implications for the taxpayers of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The Government considers this Bill to be premature.  We are surprised that the Labour Party has proposed expanding the remit of the redress board before we have completed our discussions with the congregations.  The Labour Party had been particularly critical of the Government committing to the redress scheme in advance of settling contributions from the religious congregations and now this is exactly what it is asking the Government to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">A number of the main elements of the Bill are focused on proposed amendments to the redress scheme.  I will outline to the House the background to those elements of the redress legislation which the Labour Party proposes to amend.  The redress scheme was an additional benefit which the Oireachtas thought appropriate for children of a particular age who attended specific institutions and the scheme did not affect the right of any individual to bring legal proceedings.  It was never intended, nor would it be feasible, to cover all cases of abuse occurring in every institution in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The Bill proposes an extension of the redress scheme to allow for late applications to be accepted.  The original legislation allowed for applications over a period of three years from its introduction.  The Labour Party now proposes a further three-year period from the date of passing of its proposed Bill.  To date, the redress board has received 450 late applications since the closing date, with over 50 of these being received in the period since the publication of the commission's report.  The 450 late applications were dealt with as follows: a total of 109 submissions were accepted by the board; a total of 177 submissions were disallowed by the board; a total of 12 applications were invalid; ten submissions were withdrawn; in 121 cases the board is awaiting further information from the applicant and 21 submissions remain to be considered by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">It is worth noting that the existence of the scheme was extensively advertised prior to the closing date set by the current legislation.  The redress board spent approximately €900,000 advertising the scheme on television and radio and in newspapers.  The current Act makes provision for late applications in exceptional circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">In terms of the proposal to extend the age restriction to allow persons who were in institutions between the ages of 18 and 21, many Members will be aware that this matter is currently the subject of a Supreme Court appeal.  We believe it appropriate that this particular appeal be heard and adjudicated on.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">In compiling the original Schedule of institutions which accompanies the Act, my Department had access to records in regard to the 59 industrial and reformatory schools listed on the original Schedule and was in a position to confirm that these institutions were eligible for inclusion on the Schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">We consider the Labour Party Bill to be premature and recommend it be opposed.  We are mindful that survivors have called on all of us not to politicise what is a fundamental and therefore important issue for civic society.  There is an onus on all of us to act collectively in all of their interests.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_668">There are a few other outstanding issues I want to deal with.  The Bill seeks to remove section 28(6) of the current legislation.  Deputy Quinn, in a statement issued on Thursday, 18 June, and again tonight, suggested that this section effectively prohibited applicants from recounting the stories of their childhood.  That is simply not the case.  This provision was originally included in the legislation because of people's constitutional entitlement to their good name and, without this provision the redress board would descend into a series of individual court cases with an adversarial approach and associated legal representation that would effectively collapse the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Legal advices received in my Department state that this section of the current Act does not prohibit applicants from recounting the stories of their childhood, as is suggested.  All that it prohibits is mention of the fact that compensation was either applied for or paid as a result of the conditions they may have suffered during their childhood.  We realise this is an issue of much concern to the victims and we will consider their views further in the context of legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Another issue of concern to survivors, and one which has also been raised by the Labour Party in the context of this Bill, is the maintenance of records of both the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  It may be possible to respond positively regarding these recommendations, subject to safeguards.  However, there are also likely to be cost implications of any process for safeguarding and providing access to records of the commission and the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Issues arise also relating to data protection which cannot be ignored.  Further consideration will be given to this issue in consultation with the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board and subject to any legal advices which may need to be sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The issue of criminal records is one which has been raised many times and the Government has done everything possible to clarify the position.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was called to give evidence on this module of the Ryan commission hearings in June 2006.  During the course of that evidence, the question of the criminalisation of children detained in industrial schools pursuant to an application under section 58 of the Children Act 1908 was raised with the senior official of the Department.  It was explained that the provisions of section 58 of the 1908 Act do not create a criminal offence and do not provide for a finding of guilt; and an order made pursuant to section 58 does not give rise to a criminal record.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Ryan report does not make any recommendations for the introduction of any new measures to address this issue. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is conscious that individual survivors may still have concerns.  He has undertaken that any such individual can write to him, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, attaching a copy of their court record and-or any other official documentation, and his officials will look into the concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The Bill also contains proposals to allow the Government appoint an auditor to examine the financial affairs of the congregations to ascertain the true extent of the property available.  The Government has already committed to a process whereby a group of three will access the veracity of financial reports produced by the congregations.  It is better to await the outcome of the engagement with the religious congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The other matters raised in the Bill also require further consideration and, in some cases, legal advice.  It is clear that the Government is committed to addressing the needs of survivors into the future.  However, I do not agree that the provisions of the Labour Party Bill are necessarily the way to go.  They are all matters which require further consideration and it is for this reason that the Bill is being opposed by the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_676">I welcome the opportunity to address the Bill.  While I recognise what the Labour Party is doing by presenting this Bill, it is clearly an act of engagement in this debate.  I hope the Labour Party Members will be able to agree among themselves in a manner that does not require the House to be divided on this issue.  The legislation they seek to bring forward from their perspective is feeding into a debate which has found unanimity in the House to date.  For the first time since I entered this House there has been a collegial approach to dealing with this issue, an issue which besmirches and damages the reputation of this State in a serious way.  To some extent all political parties bear a responsibility for not dealing with this issue over previous generations and it is right that we would work collectively to seek to redress the serious hurt that has been caused to so many people and ensure we go forward in co-operation and bring about changes to the legislation, where necessary.  Central to all of that, however, must be that the victim will remain our foremost concern in everything we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I appeal to the Labour Party not to divide the House tomorrow night but to put their concerns on the table.  The Minister has indicated a willingness to review the contributions and the Bill that has been put forward and said directly that he will seek the appropriate legal advice.  I am sure, when it is appropriate, necessary legislation can be brought forward to put the victims at the centre of our deliberations and ensure that whatever is necessary to protect and enhance what has been rightly done for them is done in a way that deals with all the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">On the history of what has been done since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, initially gave the apology and the various things that have happened since, I am aware from my discussion with many victims that the most important aspect for them was to put their views on the record and have somebody listen to them and believe them.  For far too long those people, many of whom closeted themselves in their community, were afraid to come forward.  In some cases they felt they would be stigmatised in their community and some of them felt guilty.  It is wrong to think that the victims of this type of abuse felt guilty.  The fact that they were able to go before the redress board, put their statements on the record and move forward has been hugely helpful to those I have had the opportunity to meet.  It has been a humbling experience for me to hear the personal stories of so many people.  It is helpful in terms of the work we do to hear the traumatic issues that befell these people and their capacity to deal with life thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The most important thing to happen following the publication of the report was to ensure that justice was not just done but was seen to be done.  That is important in terms of the indication from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he would deal with the issue by way of prosecution and that he had asked the gardaí to look into the files put forward by the Ryan report to ensure that, where possible, recognising that the passage of time would make it difficult, they will bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes before the courts and seek to prosecute and punish to the greatest extent possible, regardless of the implications.  I hope that will be done in as many cases as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The Bill raises a number of issues, particularly the extension of the time limit.  Notwithstanding the considerable advertising of the redress board, there have been some late applications.  There was a further flurry of interest after the publication of the Ryan report.  This proves that, regardless of what advertising one does, until it is published a report does not find its way into the public ether.  Scarcely anyone in this State is unaware of the redress scheme, as a result of the media attention generated by the publication of the Ryan report.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I have an open mind about the extension of the scheme.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_683">I am not sure the measure benefits people in the State but interest outside is beginning to be significant.  Current legislation allows for some late applications.  The Minister of State has outlined how some of the late applications have been dealt with to date.  Perhaps an extension can be addressed when the Minister of State has considered the matter further.  I would like to see such a measure included.  I do not think it necessary to divide the House on this issue.  I hope we can look at this issue in a co-operative way.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The Minister of State also mentioned financial implications.  These should not blind us from doing what is right for those seeking redress.  All victims must be treated equitably to the best extent possible and assisted through life.  Financial implications must be considered.  The religious institutions are working towards the resolution of these outstanding issues.  I hope further resources will be made available in line with the transparent and audited way in which the religious institutions seek to further enhance the existing agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The Bill, while well meant and well thought out with regard to the issues which need to be addressed, is premature.  The legal advice is that it should not proceed.  However, I hope it will feed into the debate.  Labour Party Deputies have genuine concerns in this regard.  That they have presented this Bill to the House is an indication of that.  I hope they can find a way to avoid a division on an issue which evokes the same level of abhorrence in all of us and to which we are all equally resolved to find a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">It is important to keep the victims of institutional abuse, which was perpetrated under the guidance of the State by certain sections of religious orders, to the fore.  Whatever measures we bring forward must keep victims centre stage.  Nothing on the periphery should detract us from ensuring that they are given the best possible opportunity and whatever help and assistance they need as quickly as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Beverley Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_687">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Labour Party Bill.  A number of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to speak after the publication of the Ryan report.  That is the most difficult report I have had to speak on in my 12 years in this House.  We have had to confront a very difficult situation.  For many years, we have been aware that abuse happened in institutions but to be confronted with the reality of five volumes and the horror stories they contained was a very black experience for anyone in public life and for the entire country.  There is not a man, woman or child in Ireland who was not deeply affected by that report.  That is certainly the feeling of everyone on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Since the Ryan report was published and debated in the House, the Government has accepted its 20 recommendations and pledged its commitment to implement them.  That was not a hollow gesture but something tangible and solid.  People are desperate to see that something is being done and that the issue is being treated with the seriousness it deserves.  I welcome the Government's commitment to accept and implement all 20 recommendations as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I also welcome the Government's admission that abuse of children occurred because of failures of systems, policy, management and administration and of senior personnel.  It is important for victims that this admission has been made.  In recent weeks, I have met victims of institutional abuse and listened to their stories.  The story of abuse is a difficult one to tell to a stranger.  It is not easy for someone like myself, who had such a happy upbringing, to listen to the horrors experienced by victims of abuse.  It is extremely difficult to listen to the story and a thousand times more difficult to tell it.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The Labour Party Bill is well intentioned and I agree with many of the measures it contains.  I hope something meaningful and long-lasting will result from this chapter in our history.  The Government has entrusted Deputy Barry Andrews with the task of developing a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  That plan is to be brought to Government by July and it is important that it be done quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">When I speak to victims of abuse, I am impressed by their desire to tell their story and to be believed and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.  The Minister for Education and Science has said he will give further consideration to the relaxation of the confidentiality clause.  I would like to see him go further than that.  It is important for victims, not merely to name the institution in which they were abused but to tell their stories in the fullest possible way.  It is part of the healing process to tell one's story truly, openly and transparently and that the story is believed.  This is a central theme.  I ask the Minister to consider this measure carefully and look closely at accepting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I cannot understand why the Ryan commission records cannot be retained.  The Minister has also undertaken to consider this matter further.  I am heartened by the Government's response that an Assistant Garda Commissioner has been charged with examining the Ryan report and that the Garda Síochána and the DPP will have the Government's fullest co-operation in pursuing any criminal investigation which may arise.  No Member of this House wants to see any person who carried out these horrendous crimes being protected in any way.  It is not in our interests, those of the victims or those of the Irish people.  The people's tolerance is at such a point that they want the persons in question exposed, brought before the courts and convicted.  Everything we can do to make this a reality must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Waiving the legal privilege over the details of the 2002 indemnity report has been discussed heavily in the House.  I favour the details being revealed, as it is an important matter.  We are discussing the contribution of the religious orders and a bill for the State of €1 billion.  When one is discussing spending taxpayers' money and——</p>

          <p eId="para_696">I listened to Deputy Quinn.  I attended a Convent of Mercy school and received a wonderful education under the Sisters of Mercy nuns.  I have nothing against the orders' individual members.  In fact, I have met many members in recent days.  They are carrying a heavy burden because the totality of the situation is falling on everyone and members are getting tarred with the same brush, which is unfair.  I think——</p>

          <p eId="para_700">Fine Gael fully supports the Labour Party Bill, which contains provisions that reflect issues detailed in the all-party motion passed by the Dáil on 12 June.  Many of the issues addressed in the Bill are those that Fine Gael insisted be mentioned in the motion.  They would not have been included had we not pursued the issue with the Government in the lead-in to the debate on the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">As I spoke at length on the Ryan commission report, I will confine myself to the Bill, events that have occurred since the report's publication and issues that the Government has failed to address. Our party had been prepared to afford the Government some reasonable time to implement the motion's provisions, but it is six weeks since the publication of the Ryan commission report.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">It is an indictment of the Government and unacceptable that, despite promises made by the Taoiseach and Ministers following its publication, two all-party Dáil motions, the outpouring of hurt and anguish from victims of institutional child abuse and repetitive apologies from the church, State and religious organisations, nothing to date has visibly changed.  Other than the Government meeting representatives of victim organisations and the religious congregations, it is impossible to identify any meaningful substantive action it has taken in the wake of the report's publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Within four weeks of its publication, the State vigorously defended in the High Court a case taken by a victim of abuse, resident in England, seeking a time extension to apply to the redress board for compensation.  Instead of wasting taxpayers' resources on solicitors and counsel to defend the indefensible, the redress board and the Government should have allowed the man to apply for redress or, at a minimum in light of the all-party motion, sought to have the proceedings adjourned for a short period while they addressed the overall issue of extending time to potential applicants to apply to the board.  The motion referred to this specific issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">The Minister for Education and Science discussed the question of extending the age from 18 years to 21 years in respect of those who were victims in residential institutions, which is properly addressed in the Labour Party Bill.  The Minister's defence for not addressing the issue is that there is a case on appeal awaited in the Supreme Court.  The State lost this case in the High Court.  During the time when so many people suffered almost incomprehensible barbarity and abuse in our institutions, they were considered minors until they reached 21 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">This is a political decision, a matter of judgment to be made in the House, not on the basis of some technical constitutional argument the Government has already lost in the High Court and to be repeated in the Supreme Court with all of the legal expense attached to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_709">Deputy Quinn is right.  There is no reason for the House to abdicate its role to the Supreme Court in this regard or for the Government to spend more taxpayers' money defending an issue that does not deserve defending.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">In the context of extra money being provided by religious organisations towards the overall compensation sum payable by the redress board, the Minister referred to discussions that have been held.  The Government is engaging in secret ongoing discussions with the religious congregations which, to date, have failed to give any meaningful commitment to contribute extra money to the redress fund and have only publicly committed themselves to making an unspecified contribution towards some form of trust fund to be established for the benefit of victims of abuse.  Fine Gael supports the establishment of the trust fund, but the congregations should contribute 50% of the redress funds being paid out.  It is of serious concern and contrary to the public interest that no definitive timeframe has been set for these matters to be resolved.  The  congregations have given no firm commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">It is vital that there be published a full credible audit of the property ownerships of the congregations so that the Government and the general public can assess their capacity to make the contribution required to meet their moral obligations to the victims of abuse.  The Minister stated that the information produced by the religious orders will be reviewed by three people, but we need to know more than this.  Who are the three people, how will they review the information, will the review be published, how will they assess the credibility of the orders' statements about their property ownerships and will the audit of ownerships extend to extensive properties owned outside the State?  All of these matters need greater clarification than we have had to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I called on the Government to conduct an inquiry into institutions where it was alleged children were the victims of either physical or sexual abuse and that have not been investigated by the Ryan commission.  These include St. Laurence's in Finglas, Trudder House, Trinity House, Scoil Ard Mhuire in Lusk and Madonna House.  Former residents of these institutions have the same rights and entitlements as those of institutions investigated by the Ryan commission.  These are issues that the Government should address, but is failing to.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">There is no indication that the Government has learned from the report the essential need for accountability and transparency in our child protection services.  Despite previous promises made in the Dáil, portions of the report on the Monageer tragedy published almost two months ago remain censored and seven of its recommendations made to improve child protection and family services remain a mystery.  These recommendations have only been read by Ministers and Professor Drumm who, incredibly, cannot communicate the exact recommendations to those involved in the provision of such services.  Even more incredibly, Members of Dáil Éireann have no knowledge of the seven recommendations and cannot, therefore, hold the Government or the HSE to account for their implementation.  So much for the Government taking the Ryan commission's message of the need for transparency and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">It is widely known that there are three internal HSE reports on the deaths of three children in recent years in the care of health boards or the HSE, namely, Kim Donovan aged 15 years, Tracy Fay aged 18 years and David Foley aged 17 years.  The Minister for Health and Children and the HSE continue to suppress these reports and are conducting themselves in a manner only seen in totalitarian dictatorships where governments have no accountability to a properly elected parliament.  It is scandalous that, as a Member of the Dáil and Fine Gael's spokesperson on children, I have found it impossible to gain access to any of the reports detailing what happened to these children for whom the State had responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I have been seeking information from the HSE on 20 children in the care of the State who have lost their lives in the past decade.  Four months after raising the issue by way of a Dáil question, all I have managed to learn comes from a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which states that the HSE has set up some internal review group to examine what occurred, identify key issues common to the children’s deaths and make recommendations to the HSE’s national director.  I understand that, of the 20 deaths, key questions relate to the deaths of 11 children who died as a result of drug overdoses, assaults or suicide.  What is now needed is not an internal review group, but an independent inquiry into the deaths of children in care.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Have no lessons been learned from the Ryan commission report?  Why do the Government, the State and the HSE continue to conduct themselves in the manner of years gone by, which is to suppress information and bring no light to bear on the inadequacies of our child care systems?  In no other EU democracy would there be such continuing and obsessive secrecy relating to the deaths of children for whom the state has responsibility, nor would there be a failure of government to account to parliament for what occurred.  It is absolutely clear that neither the Government nor the HSE, despite all the verbiage and apologies, has yet truly learned the lessons from the Ryan commission's report.  A radical change of attitude and approach, and new insight, are badly required.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In light of the Government's conduct in recent weeks, Fine Gael is concerned that it will not deal properly with matters arising from the report.  We support the principles of the Labour Party's Bill and believe each issue contained therein deserves to be addressed properly.  The Government should support the Bill's provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Minister spoke tonight about politicising the issue.  This is a parliamentary assembly, the purpose of which is to introduce legislation to address injustice and issues that require to be addressed.  It is the Government that, this evening, is politicising a Bill that should not be politicised.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">It is obvious from the Minister's speech that there is a broad range of issues he agrees need to be examined.  He is not rejecting what is proposed in the Bill.  Most of the issues derive from the all-party motion passed in this House and all the Bill aims to do is give substantive legislative form to them.  If the Government does not want to play politics with this, it should show some decency, humility and insight.  Tomorrow evening it should not divide the House but accept the principles of the Bill and allow, in the context of whatever work the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, are doing, for its consideration on Committee Stage next September.  This would allow for the consideration of the conclusions the Government reaches at the end of July.  It would also allow for the badly needed reforms, required to benefit the survivors of institutional abuse, to be put on the Statute Book sooner rather than later, that is, by the autumn.  Consequently, those who should acquire rights under the legislation will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  By agreeing to the Bill, we will not find ourselves in a legislative morass whereby, this time next year, the Government will have failed to publish legislation promised this July, thereby requiring the survivors of institutional abuse to wait for justice yet again.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I welcome the Labour Party's Bill and congratulate Deputy Quinn on introducing it.  As Deputy Shatter stated, it is six week since the Ryan report was published and three since the Dáil debate, in which many Members on all sides promised to cherish all our children equally.  The Bill sets out to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">All State activity should be underpinned by three principles: transparency, accountability and fairness.  When we spoke on this issue three weeks ago, I pointed out, as I had pointed out heretofore, that we still have no independent inspectorate for 450 children with disabilities who are in institutional care.  How can this be?  Will we have another scandal in five to ten years?</p>
          <p eId="para_722">There still has not been a full and proper investigation into the residential home of the Brothers of Charity in Galway, which matter was discussed by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Minister criticised this Bill as divisive, yet it is he who seeks to divide the House.  All the Bill seeks to do is give reality to the promises made by the House and to ensure no victim will lose out through a technicality.  It will be sad if, at the first time of asking, the Government is found wanting, despite its promises.  Yet again, it is consumed with financial consequences rather than with achieving justice for the victims, some of whom are present tonight.  What an insult this will be to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">As Deputy Shatter pointed out, and as Deputy Quinn will probably do when making his concluding remarks, there is no need to oppose this Bill.  It is only on Second Stage and we have the entire summer to address the various legal issues that some believe might arise.  The people have waited long enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Since I have become a Member of this House, the recurrent theme is the Government's contention that legal opinion is required; this is the great fig leaf it uses time and again.  For too long we have listened to the mantra about mysterious law.  We are not even told what the legal issues are; they are alluded to in a vague fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The congregations also hid behind the law.  I despair that the Government is doing so to frustrate the rights of victims.  This is how it will appear to the people.  All the outpourings of shame, indignation and sorrow will mean nothing if we do not follow up our words with action.  This is what Deputy Quinn is trying to do through this Bill.  He is trying to ensure that, by extending the definition of "child" to encompass individuals aged up to 21, people will not lose out.  This would get rid of the gagging clause, which must clearly set alarm bells ringing in this House and around the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_728">Why have a gagging clause if we want transparency, accountability and fairness?  It is contrary to the very idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The adversarial approach, mentioned by many victims who attended hearings of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, must be abolished.  They are re-victimised at the hearings, having already suffered at the hands of the State and congregations throughout their childhood.  We must not allow this to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The Bill seeks to broaden the term "institution" so it will not be confined to a list of institutions but to a list of categories thereof such that victims will not be excluded.  The Bill seeks to accommodate those who might have been excluded through not being aware of the procedures they should have followed.  As Deputy Quinn suggested, such people may have been out of the State or may be illiterate.  I met one such man outside the Dáil during the previous debate.  He missed out and, in his desire to press charges, he must go from Garda station to Garda station.  He lives in town, does not have transport and has limited means but is told he must go to the Garda station nearest to the institution he attended.  This is nonsense and is certainly not suggestive of a State trying to make amends or atone what happened under its jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">We need to ensure the Taoiseach's promise — that those who attended the institutions will have their slates wiped clean of criminal history — will be honoured.  The individuals concerned were children after all and many committed no crime.  Some were merely found playing in a derelict building and were accused of breaking windows, on foot of which they were institutionalised.  We need all these people's slates wiped clean and that is what this Bill seeks to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">If we want transparency, accountability and fairness, we must have a full audit of the assets of the orders who ran the institutions.  The Bill only seeks to put into action the many words spoken on all sides of this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">There are no real legal issues that cannot be addressed over the course of the summer months to the satisfaction of all.  The greatest legal wrangles occur when people wish to obstruct and frustrate.  The old saying, "where there is a will, there is a way", could not be more true than it is tonight.  If there truly is a will to make amends on the part of the congregations, they will not seek cover behind legalese and technicalities.  If there is a will on the part of the State, as expressed by the Taoiseach, it will not seek to hide behind legal niceties either.  Compromise can be reached and a settlement can be made; there is no need for delay or to oppose this Bill.  If it is opposed, it will send a stark reminder to the people that they will hear nothing from the Government in this House but weasel words that have no meaning or intent and that it will not really set about addressing the issues it pretends to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Our intention is to honour the promises of this House to compensate the victims of institutional abuse, which was widespread, extensive, physical, psychological and sexual.  I see no reason we cannot agree to Second Stage of this Bill tomorrow night.  I commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_736">I do not wish to detain the House but the Minister engaged in some general debate on the background to the legislation and said that he was accused of plucking it out of the sky.  I do not know who made that accusation.  I have not heard it but the Minister has shown himself to be a dab hand at manipulating many of the comments on this legislation for partisan purposes, which is a pity because we could have a good debate as we are charged with the responsibility of having.  It is important to get it right because section 3 is remarkably similar to section 70 of the 2006 Act, which is not working.  The Minister has failed to provide the House with a detailed rationale for this.  It has been tried only once and on that occasion it was not successful in garnering a solitary conviction.  I would like to see a proposal from the Minister that would deal with the weakness or inadequacy of section 70.  It is somewhat less than clear.  We must get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The Minister said that resources are not an issue but the Garda is operating on a budget of €35 million less than was at its disposal last year.  That is a resource reduction.  I do not know how that gap is to be filled without there being a resource issue.  The Minister mentioned the letter that he wrote to me on 3 July and I share the concern of Deputy Rabbitte because at no stage does the Minister adduce any evidence for any degree of intimidation of jurors and the figures he produced show sets of proceedings and years but it is not possible to separate the witnesses from the jurors.  The only reason that I can see for that is that there have been no figures on the table dealing with the number of proceedings that have commenced for offences under section 41 of the 1999 Act between 2002 and 2009 that have referred to the juries.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I take seriously what the Minister has said.  I have heard it from Deputy O'Donnell and am satisfied that what has been said has a basis and we should take seriously the claims of the State solicitor for Limerick, Mr. Murray, who has spoken publicly on numerous occasions.  In addition to talking about the criminal fraternity he made a serious charge recently.  I call on the appropriate agencies of the State, the State prosecution office, and the Garda Síochána to investigate a charge he made when he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_739">This unusual piece of legislation was promoted by concern within certain official circles that a tiny minority of solicitors are harvesting information on operational matters and passing them on to the criminal fraternity and effectively acting as criminal intelligence officers for criminal gangs.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">That is a most serious charge.  The article cites a Garda source who said there was "merit" in Mr. Murray's claims because "gardaí interviewing suspects, under arrest, have matters repeated to them which they feel could only have come from legal people dealing with criminals".  I would like these serious issues to be investigated.  In addition to the Garda investigating these most disturbing claims the professional bodies, particularly the Incorporated Law Society, should play their part in investigating these most serious charges against members of the legal profession.  Later in the course of this legislation we will be dealing with situations in which a judge, often a junior and inexperienced member of the judicial hierarchy, no disrespect to any member of that body, might deal with aspects of this legislation while everyone else is barred, apart from a member of the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">According to the Minister's latest amendment, circulated some moments ago, that judge on his or her own can make a decision based on the evidence of a former garda, someone who is not a member of the Garda Síochána, without the benefit of any legal advice.  One reason for this is that members of the legal profession have been "harvesting information on operational matters and passing them on to the criminal fraternity and effectively acting as criminal intelligence officers for criminal gangs".  Is that why legal officers will be debarred from certain portions——</p>

If the Minister acts on this in the same way as he acts on the anecdotal evidence of his colleague, the Minister for Defence, the point made by Members on all sides of the House, and beyond, that we should deal with the small print in a way that ensures we get it right is valid because the Supreme Court will test every line of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I ask the Minister to give us every opportunity to deal with each section of the Bill.  He should refrain from making statements to the effect that people say he plucked this out of the sky.  He did not pluck it out of the sky but the manner of, and the timeframe and the process for dealing with, this Bill are less than they should be.  Having regard to the failings of the 2006 Act, which he is trying to address, it is important that he answer the questions that arise in the House.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_745">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on section 3 of this Bill.  This is an important debate on crucial legislation but we are going away from the core issue.  We are also forgetting about the real world as it was played out in this city of Dublin over the past few days.  I ask my colleagues to listen to the voices of the people and victims before any final comments on the legislation are made.  Those of us familiar with the drug and gangland issue through our constituents and work over 20 years know there is a war going on between gangland criminals and sections of the State.  We must deal with the matter head on as it is unacceptable that victims in communities are being intimidated.  That is the core issue in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Some of us have always taken a very strong pro-civil liberties and human rights position.  The right to life and to be able to express views and opinions in a free democracy is an important human right.  This legislation is about that, and we should deal with the intimidation of jurors in an objective and professional way.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">From my experience I know it is a real problem.  I spoke to 13 of my constituents in the past hour and a half and they all expressed major concerns about being intimidated or threatened if they were on a jury in a case dealing with gangland crime.  These are a mix of people working in the private and public sectors, some of whom are tradesmen.  These people would worry about the protection of themselves and their families in such scenarios.  Such a problem is real and forms an important part of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I have met people who have suffered fear with a capital "F".  Many witnesses over the years, and not just recently, have been intimidated by some of these gangs and criminals.  It is horrific to hear about some of the positions innocent people have been in while they have tried to do their civic duty.  We should face up to the issue and listen to what people are saying about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Deputy Charles Flanagan commented on resources and I agree this is a crucial issue.  Another important element in the debate concerns the management of Garda resources.  There should be examples of good practice in policing and good management.  I remember when serving on a previous Oireachtas committee on justice hearing about some of the experiences of gardaí and from other international police forces.  We saw some of the great work done both in this country and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I pay tribute to the sections of the Garda Síochána which do an excellent job, particularly those fighting gangland crime and involved in Operation Anvil.  There are people on the front line dealing with the armed people who intimidate others, and there are other members of the Garda in the drug squad.  The drug squad is made up of young men and women who take a major risk, and they fight battles every day that often do not make the headlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">As Members of the Oireachtas we must support the efficient management of the resources within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda.  We must eliminate any kind of political cronyism in promotion and I would like to see the people who do a good job and show examples of good practice leading the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">We have heard much about Limerick but in reality, the problem is widespread.  Intimidation is not just confined to Limerick and people are living in fear all over the country.  I see it regularly in my own constituency where people do not even have the courage to drop into the local Garda station when they know drug dealing is ongoing and there are people with guns up the street from their house.  They are afraid of being burned out of their house.  With regard to the minority of solicitors allegedly acting on intelligence for gangs, if that is the case they should be rooted out.  I see a strong role in this for the Law Society.  Such action is unacceptable; it is a scandal and a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">There is much discussion on the rank of gardaí with regard to evidence being provided.  I have no problem with this being provided by good quality gardaí who may not necessarily be superintendents or chief superintendents.  These should be people who know the issue on the ground and who have the ability and intelligence to provide credible evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">A very important part of this debate is often missed.  We can go around the houses on particular aspects of legislation but it is very important that we listen to the voices of victims of crime.  We saw the plight of one victim over the past few days and that incident was absolutely appalling.  People should not think I will stand as a Member of the Oireachtas and stay silent on this.  It is absolutely disgraceful that a young man in his own community could be gunned down outside his house.  Two days from now that death will be forgotten.  We must act on this, consider the facts and listen to the people on the ground who are demanding that we deal with gangland crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I remind Deputies that we are dealing with whether section 3, as amended, should stand part of the Bill.  It is concerned with the definition of criminal organisations and structured groupings.  The Chair has allowed latitude but matters extraneous to that question may be more relevant later.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_756">I will speak with reference to Limerick as I represent that area.  This legislation is very welcome but I would like extra time to go through the various sections and consider the Bill in detail to ensure we get it right.  I commented previously on an issue which goes to the heart of the matter.  As a result of the mindless murders of Roy Collins and Shane Geoghegan recently, victims and the general public in Limerick want extra resources for An Garda Síochána on the ground.  They want us to overcome the intimidation of both jurors and witnesses.  Will the Minister give a clear response on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The following point may seem straightforward but it cuts to the heart of the matter.  In this legislation, under the Special Criminal Court that is to be provided, can a conviction be achieved based on the opinion evidence of what we would like to be a chief superintendent and evidence that would arise from the surveillance legislation?  This would mean witnesses would not be required to go before the Special Criminal Court.  It is critical that we can get to the structured groups in gangland crime, so this must hold up legally.  Will the Minister give an assurance that we will not see a case where witnesses may still face the possibility of continued intimidation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_758">This debate concerns section 3 and as I stated earlier, one of the reasons for opposition to the section is that I believe it to be superfluous.  We have existing legislation which has not been used.  There is more related to it and consideration must be given as to whether this is a proportionate measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">It is difficult to say if the section is proportionate because we have not yet taken other practical steps, which I will list in a moment.  If such steps had been taken and failed, or they did not have the required success, we could then turn around and say that as a society we must consider quite draconian steps in legislation.  We would also then need to change definitions and particular sections by beefing them up, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">To my knowledge section 70 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 has not been used to the extent to which it should have been used.  A long list of crimes was provided to justify the need for that legislation.  Limerick State solicitor, Mr. Michael Murray, is reported to have made several comments in respect of solicitors.  If he or the Minister have evidence in respect of certain activities being carried out by particular solicitors, these individuals should be charged.  Under the law, quite an array of charges can be brought against people suspected of perverting the course of or hampering the delivery of justice or of assisting others in the commission of crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">There may perhaps be too much legislation and the DPP, the Garda Síochána and the Judiciary are becoming confused as a result.  We should simplify the position and ensure that people can be convicted.  What is the reason behind the collapse of cases?  If one were to believe what the Minister is stating, then cases are either not going to court or are collapsing on the basis of witness intimidation.  I will not state that witness or juror intimidation does not occur.  I commend witnesses and jurors on their bravery.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Practical steps need to be taken in respect of such intimidation.  In fairness to the organs of the State, when intimidation of this nature was highlighted in Limerick, the relevant trial was moved to a different location.  I accept that this might not be viable in every case.  However, the witness protection programme has not even been placed on a statutory footing.  In addition, the concerns to which Deputy Finian McGrath referred have not been addressed.  If we had a proper witness protection programme, it would address the concerns of those people who are being harassed on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">We have a responsibility to ensure that legislation stands the test of time.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 has not done so, which attests to the difficulties involved in rushing through legislation.  In that context, I object to the way the Bill is being rushed through.  I refer to the practical steps that might be taken.  I will now do so in respect of a later section.  I also wish to move on to deal with some of the other provisions in the legislation which are odious.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_764">I welcome the legislation but I do not welcome the manner in which it is being dealt with in the House.  Once again, the Minister ran to the media before revealing the detail of the legislation to the Members of this House, particularly the Opposition spokespersons on justice.  This shows that he has very little regard for the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Intimidation is certainly taking place in certain communities.  There are areas in which people are living in fear and where gangs rule the roost.  Those gangs must be taken on.  Tragically, 16 people throughout the country — many of them in the greater Dublin area and Limerick — have lost their lives as a result of gangland activity this year.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have an obligation to do everything in our power to combat such activity.  In addition to legislation, we must also ensure that adequate resources are provided.  It is outrageous that, in 2009, only 50% of all Garda stations have access to e-mail.  How will we take on gangland criminals and drug lords if such basic resources are not available?  In the past two years, no new Garda cars have been purchased.  Members of the force are obliged to take on gangland criminals who drive around in souped-up cars or armoured or bullet-proof vehicles.  We are not putting in place the necessary resources to allow the Garda to fight gangland crime.  That is the real difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Fine Gael has continually suggested that a new rank of community garda be created.  That would make sense because there is a need to nip in the bud the type of activity to which I refer.  If we do not proceed in this way, we will not deal with the problem.  There must be a clear line of promotion within the force for community gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I welcome the legislation but not the manner in which it is being dealt with in the House.  What is happening is typical of the way in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform operates.  He uses the media to further his cause rather than relying on the Members of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">The Minister indicated that the amended definitions are merely a simpler formulation but that they will nonetheless make it easier to charge persons with the offences in question.  The Bill does not substantially change the definition of what constitutes a criminal organisation which is contained in the 2006 Act.  If it was never deemed practicable to bring the 2006 definition into play and if no convictions were secured on the basis of it, we must ask whether convictions can be secured on the basis of that which is contained in the legislation before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Is there a requirement that sufficient evidence to be provided to allow a judge, of the Special Criminal Court or any other court, to decide to convict someone on the basis of his or her membership of an organisation?  This is particularly relevant in view of the fact that the provision in the 2006 Act has not been implemented.  Further consideration must be given to this matter.  I am of the view that section 3 is not practical.  It is so vague that if one were a criminal lawyer of some standing, one could pick holes in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_772">I have witnessed the intimidation of many people in Limerick, the city in which I live.  I have seen elderly people and the mothers of young children being intimidated to such an extent that they were obliged to leave their homes.  I know people who cannot go to bed at night because they are afraid of certain individuals who live in their communities.  I am aware that certain people have withdrawn evidence they provided at Garda stations because they were called as witnesses and subsequently were intimidated.  However, I have not been informed of jury members or potential jury members in the Limerick area being intimidated.  I am not stating that this has not happened and I understand that one case has been brought to the attention of the authorities.  However, I am not aware that intimidation of jury members is occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">If jurors or potential jurors are being intimidated, there is a provision whereby the DPP — if instances of intimidation are brought to his attention — may refer cases to the Special Criminal Court.  Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or anybody in Limerick — including the Minister for Defence — bringing evidence of intimidation of jury members or potential jury members to the attention of the DPP?  If such evidence has been provided, what action has been taken?  While I am aware of intimidation, it is intimidation of people in communities.  It is the kind of appalling intimidation the Collins family and other families in Limerick have been obliged to endure.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">As for the issue raised by Deputy O'Donnell, witnesses undoubtedly must be called in the Special Criminal Court and I cannot discern how this legislation will protect them in any way.  I refer to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill that was proposed initially by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, as the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill and which subsequently was brought before the House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In providing that information and intelligence gained through covert surveillance can be used in a court of law against potential or alleged gangland criminals, it is a strong legislative measure that will be able to protect witnesses in the sense that such evidence may be used in court, perhaps as a substitute for witnesses or people being obliged to come forward to give evidence.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_776">The Labour Party has no problem in supporting strong criminal justice legislation that will protect the public and that will put such gangland criminals behind bars for as long as is necessary.  However, bad law will not address this problem nor will rhetoric of the kind I have just heard from Deputy Finian McGrath.  Effective legislation and policing, as well as honesty with the people, are what is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I am a representative for Limerick, which has been referred to many times in the course of this debate.  I conduct a clinic once a week in each of the areas that frequently are referred to and in which many of these gangland criminals hold sway over innocent people in their own communities.  I assure the Ceann Comhairle that I am willing to support any legislation that I consider will improve the situation in such communities and that will lock up anyone who is guilty in this regard.  However, there is no point in fooling people that this legislation will somehow address this problem, as I do not believe it will.  I believe this legislation could be effective if it is amended.  In particular, I suggest that were amendment No. 6, tabled by my colleagues, Deputies Rabbitte and Sherlock, to be taken on board by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would put into statute the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to refer cases in which there is real evidence that juries are likely to be intimidated to the Special Criminal Court.  In that case, this legislation could be effective.  However, it simply is not telling the truth to suggest this cannot already be done, as I understand it can.  Putting it into statute by way of this amendment certainly would strengthen the present position.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Moreover, the Labour Party did not oppose this legislation on Second Stage because it believes it can be amended.  However as it stands at present, asking the Oireachtas to declare that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in respect of gangland offences is offering up this legislation to all kinds of litigation and to possible constitutional challenge.  That is not doing a service to the people of my city, who want the issues that must be dealt with to be dealt with effectively.  However, I reiterate that the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill constitutes genuine criminal justice legislation that the Garda has been seeking and which can be effective in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Having listened to Mr. Murray on the recent "The Week In Politics" television programme, I do not believe he gave a great endorsement to the comments of the Minister for Defence during his Second Stage contribution.  Mr. Murray noted that the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, spends much time walking around the constituency, which he does.  In that regard, he probably knows a lot about what is going on.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">Yes, I acknowledge he is a very fit man.  However, a much more worrying aspect of Mr. Murray's contribution to the aforementioned programme is the issue raised by Deputy Charles Flanagan regarding his remarks on practitioners of the law and what they might be engaged in with regard to criminals.  That matter certainly requires a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I have not heard anything thus far from either the Minister or anyone else in support of this legislation to suggest there is hard evidence of intimidation or that if there is, that the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to refer cases to the Special Criminal Court is not adequate to deal with the issue.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should tell Members who has raised this issue.  He should outline what specific cases have been raised by anyone in Limerick or anywhere else regarding the intimidation or possible intimidation of juries.  Moreover, if hard facts exist, he should state whether they have been brought to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_783">Initially, I responded to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's broad objection to this legislation.  I repeat this is not a monumental change to the criminal law.  As I noted previously, it proposes to treat criminal gangs in the same manner that we have for decades treated the issue of paramilitary organisations.  I reiterate that the Cabinet considered this matter a number of times.  It specifically considered the legislation over three meetings, that is, over substantial parts of two meetings and at one meeting that was devoted exclusively to the finalisation of the drafting of this legislation.  It did so on the basis of advice that I had tendered to the Cabinet with regard to the assessment made by the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána in general, in respect of the changed situation that has arisen in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins murders.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">While I can answer all the questions raised by Members, although this does not pertain exclusively to Limerick, the Garda Commissioner particularly indicated that gardaí on the ground in Limerick are conscious of a natural reluctance by people to serve on juries in criminal trials, including gang-related trials, against a background of a perception of fear and intimidation.  The Limerick State solicitor, Mr. Murray, gave one instance of which he was aware and there are others of which the Garda Síochána is aware, particularly in Dublin, as well as in Limerick.  Consequently, all the Garda's hard evidence is that there is a strong fear, particularly in the aforementioned geographical areas, of people bringing themselves forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I chose my words carefully previously, when I stated that each issue dealt with in this legislation is a response to issues that have been of concern.  While the Limerick State solicitor, Mr. Murray, has instanced some grave misgivings regarding the activities of some solicitors, I repeat the legislation was drafted carefully before Mr. Murray made his statements and before Members made statements in this House regarding the intimidation of jurors.  The legislation is based on the hard information that been brought to my attention by the Garda Síochána in respect of the intimidation of jurors.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The Garda Commissioner indicated to the Cabinet, through me, that it was his firm view that in dealing with gangland crime, the effective administration of justice would be best served by scheduling the offences in the proposed Bill for the purpose of the Offences against the State Act.  He also stated that it was his considered assessment that the established pattern of ruthless behaviour on the part of criminal gangs in their attempts to thwart the operation of the criminal justice system has created a situation where in practice, the ordinary courts will face great difficulties in securing the effective administration of justice in the case of the offences in question and that there is a compelling case for the proposed scheduling of such offences.  That assessment was based on hard evidence of intimidation of jurors and is confirmed by the anecdotal evidence of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, the State solicitor and Mr. John Hennessy, who has a very good article in the <i>Irish independent</i>, in which he writes that, as someone who has been the subject of Garda protection, “there is absolute evidence that people are extremely reluctant to serve on a jury in a gangland criminal case, and it is proving increasingly difficult to secure a jury for these trials”.  We are not relying on his word, nor on the word of the State solicitor.  We made the decision on hard information given by the Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">This is an issue on which the House should unite.  I do not suggest there are Deputies who do not want to see the back of these people.  In the context of the Roy Collins murder, the Oireachtas must act in a substantial way.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">For people to suggest this is a dramatic change is not correct.  At the moment the DPP has the right to send people to the Special Criminal Court and has done so on occasions in cases that have nothing to do with paramilitary organisations.  He did so in respect of those involved in the murder of Veronica Guerin and in substantial drug offences.  The Oireachtas is sending a strong signal based on the information tendered to the Government by the Garda Commissioner and the evidence and testimony of people a few minutes ago in this House, who understand the level of fear and intimidation of the population in their respective areas.  The Oireachtas is making a strong statement that in all of these cases, in respect of two specific offences of directing and participating in criminal organisations, cases should go to the Special Criminal Court to remove any perception of difficulty with jurors, unless the DPP directs otherwise.  It may be the case that the DPP will decide that the ordinary courts are sufficient in every case.  That is an option.  The DPP is completely independent of the political process.  The Government believes the Oireachtas should send a strong signal that specific offences with which we are dealing should be raised to the same level as a threat to the State posed by paramilitary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Deputy O'Donnell referred to opinion evidence.  I emphasise that this legislation concerns expert evidence on the existence of a criminal gang.  It is not directed at the guilt or innocence of the accused.  That is not possible.  After the Shane Geoghegan murder, Members such as Deputy Noonan, a former Minister for Justice, raised the matter of opinion evidence and whether we can convict on the basis of the evidence of a chief superintendent.  The advice of the Attorney General confirmed the advice given by the previous Attorney General in 2006 to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the effect that the courts will not convict solely on the opinion evidence of a chief superintendent and that there had to be substantial corroborative evidence in this regard.</p>

It is then up to the Garda Síochána to prove that the person was part of the gang and involved in criminal intent.

          <p eId="para_797">It is not an established principle, it is an established fact in regard to terrorist offences but not for anything else.

          <p eId="para_799">One cannot do so but because of the passing of the surveillance legislation, it obviates the necessity for witnesses in some cases.  The combination of the surveillance legislation and this Bill will give the Garda Síochána far greater powers than it had heretofore in respect of criminal gangs.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The problem since 2006 has been how to establish the existence of a criminal gang.  This is what we are endeavouring to do in the section that deals with expert evidence.  People asked why this is not given by a chief superintendent but a chief superintendent would have to be briefed by somebody on the ground as to the existence of a gang.  The chief superintendent may not even be resident in the particular area and would not be able to give evidence of his own knowledge in court.  It is important that the person who gives evidence is someone who has worked in the geographic area on a daily basis for a number of years.  Hence the inclusion of former members of the Garda Síochána.  The former Assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. Tony Hickey, who was instrumental in giving evidence on some of the culprits in the Veronica Guerin case comes to mind.  It is important that such people, with a wealth of knowledge, are available.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">There is no provision in this legislation for opinion evidence of the chief superintendent.

There may be no civilian witnesses required.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">On that point, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill is already law; it is now an Act.  If it were possible to do what the Minister is suggesting under pressure from Deputy O'Donnell one could do it already.  It is dubious in the extreme that one could bring home a conviction before three judges on the basis of not producing any witness.  It is remotely possible theoretically that a combination of material gathered through covert surveillance and access to the Special Criminal Court with a garda testifying to the existence of a gang would bring home a conviction.  However, it is so remote that I suggest, with respect, that it really does not give any comfort to Deputy O'Donnell.  If Deputy O'Donnell is seeking to be satisfied that he has participated in a debate today which means witnesses might not have to be produced there is only cold comfort for him.  Unfortunately, there is intimidation of witnesses but witnesses will still have to be paraded in the Special Criminal Court and that is the short and the tall of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_804">I come from a very straightforward perspective on this; Limerick in particular has to deal with gangland crime, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan knows.  There is intimidation of witnesses and we have heard people like Michael Murray, the State solicitor, on the intimidation of jurors, about which I know.  I welcome the Bill but I want to ensure that we give as much protection as possible to jurors and witnesses to ensure we get convictions and that those who have killed people and who are engaged in activities with regard to drugs and a range of areas are brought to justice as quickly as possible.  This Bill goes in that direction but the intimidation of witnesses is a fundamental point and the Minister appreciates that.  I seek assurances that we are moving in a direction whereby we have legislation in place to deal head on with gangland crime.  It is nationwide but I can only speak from my personal experience of Limerick, the constituency and people I represent.  This is the thrust of my argument.  I welcome the Bill; I want this form of legislation and we have been calling for it for a long time.  This question needs to be raised and debated which is why it is so important that we give it time, tease it out and examine ways to deal with these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">With regard to juries in Limerick, we have heard the testimony of the two Deputies on their experience in this respect.  Court officials from Limerick are on record as stating there is a tacit understanding that there is no point in having gangland jury trials in Limerick.  I have seen suggestions on alternative methods.  We have asked the Garda Síochána about them and the Garda Commissioner clearly stated that he does not consider that moving trials would put jurors beyond the reach of intimidation of highly organised and ruthless gangs.  He also stated that he is aware of suggestions that witness anonymity could be useful and that leaving aside any constitutional issues that might arise in that regard, we have to take into account the size of the country and the reality that the nature of the offences involved is such that in many instances witnesses can be identified in practice from the details of the evidence which they would be in a position to give.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The witness protection programme is relatively unsuccessful because of the smallness of the country and the unwillingness of our people to participate in a programme where they must uproot and go to a foreign country, set up a new life there and arrange to meet their family in an unknown destination in, for instance, Germany or France on a six-monthly basis.  They are not willing to do that.  The experience of the witness protection programme is that people have come off it and have come home because they miss their families and community and the Garda must put a significant number of people under watch 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Unfortunately, that is what happened in the case of Roy Collins.  On Second Stage I quoted a letter sent to my predecessor prior to the death of Roy Collins from Stephen Collins dated 8 February 2008, in which he states that they are praying the State can improve the quality of their lives which is a living hell.  He stated this in a letter prior to his son being killed.  After his son was killed he wrote another letter and I met him and listened to his testimony.  I genuinely state that whatever doubts I had about stretching the limit of legislation were put to bed once I met that man.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_807">The point I want to put to the Minister is that nothing will change in the matter of the protection of witnesses as a result of the Bill.  Is that not the case?  There is no point in us confusing that with the intimidation of jurors.  The Irish Human Rights Commission made a submission to the Minister and it stated that in the absence of supporting data it queried a blanket assumption about the actual or potential level of jury intimidation in Ireland.  Dr. Carol Coulter, who covers this on a daily basis for <i>The Irish Times</i>, wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_808">. . . the Bill has not been accompanied by any evidence of a failure on the part of the courts or any reluctance on the part of jurors to face up to their responsibilities.  Indeed, the principal judge in the Central Criminal Court, Mr Justice Paul Carney, is on the record as stating that when gang members are brought before his jury court there is no difficulty convicting.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Why are juries not delivering perverse acquittals if there is intimidation of juries?  Do we know of any single jury trial that collapsed in this country because jurors were got at?  Somewhere along the line, when the record of this debate is being examined by jurists, jurors, archivists, historians or whatever, the thread of truth must be present.  We can all agree with the Minister about the phenomenon that is out there and that the atmosphere is being poisoned in certain limited geographical areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">I am sorry I do not have with me the figures for jurors in the normal course of events not only with regard to not serving but with regard to not turning up.  A huge proportion of jurors in the day to day business of the courts do not even turn up.  Many Members have a difficult time writing letters about guys who come to them in Saturday clinics stating they are deaf or that they have imperfect hearing.  People have been trying to get off jury service for as long as I have been around.  However, it is a different issue in certain parts of urban Ireland where people are intimidated and there is a difference between empanelling a jury and a jury actually discharging its responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I am asking whether the Minister has the evidence of intimidation.  All we are asking for is the evidence.  I ask the Minister to give the House the evidence of where there is a record or even one case of a perverse acquittal.  I know of no such case.  I have taken time out with the people I mentioned on Second Stage debate to get information on that.  I waited with some interest for the letter promised by the Minister to Deputy Charles Flanagan.  I read that letter, but there is no evidence in it of juries being intimidated.  We can hold a different view on this for the duration of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">However, taking the Bill as it stands, there is nothing in it that alters the position or provides more protection to witnesses next week than they had last week.  This is very important.  I feel from talking to colleagues casually in the corridors that some of them would like to be able to go home and say in their home communities that everything was great now because we had dealt with this gangland legislation and that witnesses would not have to appear any more.  However, those of us who follow this closely know that is not true.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">——but what the surveillance legislation will do is lessen, in certain but not all circumstances, the necessity for civilian witnesses to be brought forward.  We can never say we will be able to prove any case beyond a reasonable doubt in any court, whether a jury or non-jury case, if we do not have the required evidence and standard of proof.  Normally, that is done by people giving evidence as to what they saw on a particular occasion.  There is no doubt there is a new fear of intimidation, particularly in such geographic areas as Finglas and Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The Deputy asked for a case demonstrating intimidation.  Cases have been brought to my attention by the Garda where jurors have been interfered with and these are cases involving gangland crime.  There is one such case already on record.  The Deputy obviously did not hear Michael Murray on RTE when he said, "They started intimidating witnesses, they made life uncomfortable for jurors".  He went on to speak about his own experience.  He said that in the recent past he had certainly one case where he was very concerned at the level of intimidation of the jury, so much so that he made a report to the Garda authorities and asked them to investigate the matter where a person was acquitted in circumstances where it was clear to him that the jury was afraid.  That is one case, and I am aware of other cases where people were interfered with.</p>

          <p eId="para_825">I am talking about the change being made to the old section 70.  The Minister said we are changing it in order to simplify the definition.  How does the Minister believe that by changing it from a gang of three to where two persons can be acting in concert will simplify matters?  Now there is no need to prove there were three members acting in concert but evidence can be given there were two members and there is no need for formal rules or a hierarchical leadership structure for the gang.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">How can the Minister satisfy us the changes he has made will make a significant difference or any difference at all considering the failure or unworkable nature of section 70, which has not featured in any prosecution to any extent?  Therefore how can he say the changes he is now bringing into this new section 3 will work?  Is there similar legislation anywhere in the world that would suggest we should use this new test because it is better?  If not, the Minister has not surmounted any hurdle and there is no meaningful improvement in the situation from the original Act.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_830">I oppose section 5 of the Bill.  These supposedly new offences are unnecessary and simply part of an attempt to hoodwink the public into thinking that something is being done.  The common law offence of conspiracy and the statutory offence of accessory make sufficient provisions for these activities or activities of this nature already.  I said this previously when the Bill was first published.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties agreed with me and made a submission on the Bill.  If we had a proper Committee Stage, we would be able to bring in witnesses and the Minister could also have brought in witnesses to help his case.  For example, the Garda Commissioner or the Chief State Solicitor could have come before us and we could have teased out some of the evidence or lack of it in terms of the issues he raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The submission of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties states that it is unclear how or why these new offences are required, given the current criminal law contains measures which allow the conviction of people on conspiracy charges and for the offence of acting in concert.  In addition, as with the definition contained in section 3 which we have already discussed, these offences are too vague to satisfy the Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Constitution requires certainty of law, that is, that offences created by statute must be expressed without ambiguity, but there is ambiguity in this case.  The European Convention on Human Rights requires foreseeability of the law, that is, that the law must be formulated in such a way that a person can foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action will entail.  The proposed new offences are so vague that they do not satisfy this criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Irish Human Rights Commission agrees with me in this respect.  On examining the case law, it states that Cox <i>v</i>. Ireland suggested the State’s obligation to protect and vindicate constitutional rights meant that such penalties must be neither arbitrary nor disproportionate in their operation.  In that case, section 34 of the 1939 Act was struck down because the penalty imposed by that section — mandatory loss of office, pension and other emoluments in respect of all public servants convicted of scheduled offences — was held to be impermissibly wide and indiscriminate.  The IHRC suggests section 5 may give rise to arbitrary or disproportionate sentences for an accused who is proved to have played a more minor role in a criminal organisation, and that the potential for arbitrary or disproportionate sentences is enhanced because of the broad definition of a criminal organisation and the loose nature of its structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The IHRC also reflected on the position in advance of the 2006 Act, which at this time holds all the more true in the context of the Act's existence.  It questioned whether the proposals contained in the 2006 Act were either:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_834">. . . necessary or proportionate responses to the problem of organised crime.  The IHRC is of the view that the activity which is targeted here is already subject to appropriate criminal sanction, through existing common law and statute which prohibit conspiracy to commit an offence and prohibit the aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In the context of the debate leading to the relevant provisions of the 2006 Act, I urged the Minister to accept, in response to the very real problem of crime, gangland crime in particular, that introducing surplus legislation misses the mark and, as I noted earlier, adds to the confusion for those trying to prosecute these crimes.  The introduction of a new offence will not deter would-be criminals.  Fear of detection is what deters them, as I have argued in the past.  Instead of assaulting the fundamental rights underpinning the justice system, the Minister should reform, restructure and resource the Garda.  In response to my points on section 3, the Minister said there was no problem in terms of the State's response and that the Garda had the resources required.  However, the Garda no longer has overtime or the freedom to recruit and promote, and it does not have the telecommunications system that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">For example, one of the reasons witnesses in some areas will not communicate with the Garda Síochána is that their names were broadcast on the existing telecommunications system.  There are parts of this city and other places where people are tuned in on an ongoing basis to the Garda frequency.  If gardaí are broadcasting that there is a robbery on a certain street and Mrs. So and So gave the information, they have handed to those engaged in intimidation the witness's name and address and so on.  This is not anecdotal.  A person who has been a victim in very recent times of one of these criminal gangs, despite being involved in valuable community work, came to the attention of that gang because he made a phone call to his local Garda station.  Although he asked the gardaí not to respond immediately because he had just walked past the gang, which was involved in drug dealing at a certain location, the Garda response was to immediately send a car to the exact location.  While it was good to see the speedy Garda response, the gang knew the only person to have passed in the previous ten minutes was the individual in question, and he was targeted and has suffered the consequences for his civic action and the bravery he showed.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">I am dealing with section 5.  I am suggesting that the measures in section 5 will not deter would-be criminals.  I am perhaps pre-empting the Minister's reply that the Garda has the required resources, which he said in response to my last question.  The Garda Síochána and the wider system, including the courts system, does not have the required resources.  What the Minister is doing in this section is to introduce more confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">If more gardaí were released from desk duties or other tasks that could be civilianised, they could be used to properly tackle and implement the existing law, which has not been properly utilised.  The laws are in place but, for some reason, they have not been used.  We must ask how many court cases actually collapse.  We keep coming back to this question because it is what we are told is the reason for these new laws and why such cases will be heard in the Special Criminal Court.  How many cases collapse on a technicality because the DPP, the Garda Síochána or someone else makes a simple mistake?  How many cases collapse due to lack of evidence or having witnesses who are not credible?  How many cases collapse because of a hung jury?  As other Deputies have asked, how many cases collapse on the basis of intimidation of witnesses or juries?</p>
          <p eId="para_841">This is the type of information we would have if we had sat down and teased this out on an ongoing basis over a month or even over a full week in committee, where we could have called witnesses to ascertain whether what is being proposed is proportionate.  What we have at present falls short of the standards we should have in the justice system in terms of protection of witnesses and protection of juries.  If we had taken that road, we might have progressed further.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I believe the arguments I put forward in 2006 stand in regard to these issues.  We have not tried the simple steps first, namely, one does not go down the road of introducing new laws and concepts when the existing laws and concepts are adequate but have not been properly used.  While I could say more, I will conclude on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">The section seeks to prosecute those who control and organise the activities of criminal organisations but who are not necessarily directly involved in the commission of a particular offence.  It does not address a whole new area of law.  Similar provisions have worked very well in combating illegal organisations under the Offences against the State Act.  The definition of directing such activity has been accepted in a substantial number of trials in the Special Criminal Court dealing with paramilitary organisations under the Offences against the State Act.  One reason for the inclusion of this offence is an international obligation under the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, to which Ireland is a signatory and, therefore, we are committed to introduce it.  However, that is not the only reason.  It is clear there are people directing organisations similar to the way in which paramilitary organisations were directed.  Previously, people were sent out to carry out particular crimes but there were others behind such activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">That is exactly what is taking place here.  The logic behind scheduling these offences is that the very people directing such organisations but not carrying out the events have a very significant interest and incentive to ensure the trial of an accused person is in some way interfered with.  That is the whole point of scheduling directing and participation offences.  The faceless people or gang lords oversee these organisations in such a way that they sit pretty while some old patsy is before the court.  It is in the interests of such people to ensure the accused person gets off.  This is why there is a logic to the scheduling of such offences.  The measures are very important and I disagree implacably with the Deputy that there should not be a directing offence.  Any Deputy who represents the constituencies where this is a problem will be aware of the presence of people who do not pull the trigger but who direct how, when and who is to be taken out of existence.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">I welcome section 5, which targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders.  The legislation is part of the solution to dealing with this.  Earlier, I referred to other aspects of dealing with organised crime.  Section 5 zooms in on those who give the orders.  Some of these people may not directly participate in the commission of criminal offences but operate at some level of the organisation's structure.  Section 5(2) suggests those who direct need not necessarily be at the top of a given organisation and it recognises the different layers within such organisations.  There is a person or group at the top who makes the money and issues the orders and such people must be top of the Garda's list.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I welcome that we will comply with international UN regulations because that is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I refer to a question which has been put to me regularly.  Section 5 states the maximum penalty following conviction on indictment is imprisonment for life.  Does the Minister really believe this is likely to take place?  Many people see bad decisions being made every day in the justice system related to serious violent acts.  There is a belief that some people who commit very violent acts do not necessarily get adequate time.  I subscribe very strongly to the old fashioned view that if one does the crime one should do the time.  Does the Minister really believe the assertion in section 5 that the maximum penalty following conviction will be life imprisonment?  Many people have asked that question.</p>

Is there any basis on which that document could be made available to the Opposition spokespersons or laid in the Library?  We do not operate a privy council system but if there is information contained in that document it may be influential in the debate.  Earlier, the Minister stated he proceeded in a certain way following a discussion with the unfortunate Roy Collins's father and he has now referred to a submission from the Garda Commissioner.  When the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill was published the Garda did not want it and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated it would only serve to alert criminals to Garda investigative techniques.  Why have the views at the top of the Garda changed?</p>

          <p eId="para_854">That document formed part of the Cabinet discussions and considerations; it was part of the brief and I referred to the conclusion of that document.  The strong and hard evidence from the Garda is that in Limerick and other areas there has been intimidation of jurors.  This has been confirmed by such people as the Limerick State solicitor who has indicated in recent years there is hard evidence of the drop in juror numbers during gangland trials which have taken place, especially in Limerick.  There is a suite of evidence in that respect.  I suggest such information is subject to Cabinet confidentiality since it was part of the decision making process and the Cabinet's deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The matter of the surveillance Bill has arisen previously.  The Garda believed the time had come for the use of certain evidence obtained by existing electronic surveillance and that this would be relevant in certain circumstances or on some but not necessarily all occasions.  We have reached such a circumstance now with these offences and we seek to obviate as much as possible the necessity for reliance on civilian witnesses in many cases.  Civilian witnesses are becoming more difficult to obtain because of the fear of intimidation in such areas as Limerick and certain areas of this city.</p>

The reason I dealt with such a range of issues is that before the Minister goes down the road of introducing new offences, moving offences, he must address the simple things first.  We have not addressed the simple things and I listed quite a number of them.  I could have highlighted these at greater length to the Minister but I know he has received a copy of the ICCL report and the report of the Human Rights Commission.  I could have put the whole lot on the record of the House.  I am trying to accommodate the debate in the short time available.  I still believe that what is being done here will create a duplication.  The existing laws have not been used to their full effect and this is the key point I made in 2006.

          <p eId="para_860">On the issue of mobile phones, I have answered parliamentary questions about the use of mobile phones in prisons.  It would be wrong to say that many offences are organised from within prisons but this is not to say it has not happened.  I can assure the Deputy that the prison service has installed the most sophisticated X-ray equipment in every prison and it has had an effect.  Many of the difficulties in the prisons which are attributed to overcrowding are in fact due to the much tighter security regime on issues such as mobile phones.  I understand the mobile phone premium is very high in the prison context.  The BOSS chairs have also been installed in some prisons; they are proving to be very successful and will be installed in other prisons.  There is a blocking of the use of mobile phones in prisons.  This project commenced at the Midlands Prison and results to date have been sufficiently positive to convince the prison service of the merit of extending the inhibition system at the Midlands Prison into the new C block——</p>

          <p eId="para_863">The difficulty is with regard to Portlaoise and also to Mountjoy and the proximity of hospitals.  They have been endeavouring to get around that problem and have had some success.  Mountjoy is a particular problem; Portlaoise is not.   The inhibition system is being extended into the new C block at Portlaoise and also to the nearby segregation unit.  A contract to provide an inhibition system at those locations within Portlaoise Prison was signed on 12 March and works are now due to be completed and the system commissioned on 20 July.  Other tests are undertaken in other prison locations such as Mountjoy medical unit, Limerick A wing and Cloverhill D1.  The system in Limerick has been installed and is being evaluated since January.  The medical unit in Mountjoy has been commissioned since 29 June and is currently undergoing evaluation.  A company is due to commence installation in Cloverhill of the inhibition system shortly and works are expected to be completed by the end of July 2009.  The intention is that particular prisoners who would be suspected of directing crime from within prison would be housed as much as possible in those prisons or parts of prisons where mobile phones have been successfully inhibited.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">I cannot let the Minister away with an assertion that this blocking technology can be successful on a pilot basis in the Midlands Prison and not in Portlaoise because of the hospital.  The Midlands Prison in which the pilot project is working is actually in closer proximity to the hospital than is Portlaoise Prison where the gangsters are.  Any evidence of operating criminal activities from within prison comes from Portlaoise Prison.  That is where the gang lords are; that is where Deputy O'Donnell's and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's former constituents are and that is where the problem is.  Portlaoise Prison is actually further away from a hospital than is the Midlands Prison and therefore that argument does not hold water.  There is not the will, between the Minister and the Irish Prison Service, to deal with this issue of mobile phones in prisons.</p>

          <p eId="para_867">On the question about the intimidation of prison staff, our prison staff are very professional and to the best of my knowledge, despite difficult circumstances they operate to the best of their ability.  I am not aware of any cases of intimidation but I am not saying it has not happened in the past or does not happen now.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">In reply to Deputy Flanagan, the results in the Midlands Prison have been very good.  The inhibitor is now being moved into the C block and the segregation unit in Portlaoise Prison and it will be commissioned on 20 July.  There has been a problem with the original type.  The practice in other countries has been examined and we are way ahead of any other country in the inhibition of mobile phones; many countries are now coming here to see the system we have put in place.  We have come to the conclusion that while it might not be possible to blanket an entire prison, at least one can deal with certain sections of prisons and house the significant people in those sections and ensure the mobile phones do not operate in those areas.</p>

Amendment No. 2 redrafts subsection (6) towards two ends.  The first is to improve comprehension of the subsection by removing the list from the body of the text and appending it to the subsection in the form of a table.  The second purpose of the amendment is to extend the list of items which can give rise to the specified presumption.  The possession of the items listed would rightly give rise to some suspicion.</p>

It is likely there would be convictions if the majority of the items listed were found in somebody's possession.  The Minister has helpfully listed the Acts somebody found in the possession of these items would be in breach of and they include, in the case of a knife, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, and the Misuse of Drugs Act.  This is adding to existing legislation but why are people not being charged with possession of these items?  I am concerned that we are adding to the corpus of law for no particular reason in this case other than to transfer these offences to the Special Criminal Court.  There is danger in moving from a jury system to a non-jury system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_909">We are dealing here with important safeguards long since established on the provision of evidence when dealing with the proof of a criminal organisation but the Minister, by virtue of his amendment No. 2<i>a</i>, is going in the opposite direction to that I am proposing in amendment No. 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I would be concerned about the absence of appropriate safeguards.  I do not wish to impugn in any way the professionalism or the rank of any ordinary member of the Garda Síochána but where we are dealing with the provision of proof of the existence of a criminal organisation, the standards should be high.  In confining the provision of evidence to a senior officer we are not casting any disrespect towards an ordinary member of the Garda Síochána but reflecting the importance of the officer, which has long since been established, even in cases where we have had to resort to the Special Criminal Court or non-jury court, and the importance of the office of the senior member of the force.  Also, we are acknowledging the seriousness of the offence by ensuring that the evidence is tendered by a senior Garda officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The Minister can correct me if I am incorrect but there will not necessarily be a witness present when this evidence is being tendered as to the proof of the existence of a criminal organisation.  The Minister does not have any requirement in the section in terms of the experience of the officer and his amendment No. 2<i>a</i>, includes evidence to be tendered, and presumably accepted by way of proof, by a former ordinary member of the Garda Síochána who could be long since retired or engaged in other work, which is often the case with former members of the Garda Síochána.  I would be concerned that the Minister does not have any requirement of expertise or standard of experience and because of that I am somewhat concerned about the relaxation of the safeguards.  The Minister can take it this will be tested in the highest courts.  It is important that the measure is sound from a constitutional basis, that both experience and expertise would be a prerequisite and that the safeguards are such, having regard to the fact that this is proof of evidence, that we would acknowledge a long-standing procedure which is that the evidence would be tendered by a senior officer, a chief superintendent.  I acknowledge what the Minister said earlier about the working garda who is on the front line.  Nevertheless, we need to reflect the importance of the seniority of the rank and the gravity of the offence.  It would not be appropriate to accept the evidence of officers who might not have the necessary expertise, given the consequences.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_912">There is some confusion between opinion evidence and expert evidence.  I heard what the Minister said earlier.  I presume we are talking about an expression of opinion as to the existence of a criminal organisation.  In the operation of the Offences against the State Act the Supreme Court was definitive regarding the care to be taken in crafting the decision it handed down in respect of the use of a garda not below the rank of chief superintendent.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">With no disrespect to current or former members of the Garda, the legislation is diminished by an amendment which allows, not only any garda but any former garda to give such expert opinion.  I take the Minister's point that people are leaving the Garda service every day.  Senior gardaí are retiring at present in greater numbers, perhaps because they fear that their retirement lump sum will be taxed in December.  This is an extraordinarily open provision.  Gardaí might be brought in who have long left the force and who are running security or building companies.  I do not suppose many former gardaí are running building companies at present, but they might be writing a column for the <i>Evening Herald.  </i>I am not sure that is advisable.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I have been under the impression that in respect of the operation of the Offences against the State Act, a chief superintendent might not have direct knowledge of membership of an illegal organisation but that the gardaí working to him would have such knowledge and would brief him accordingly.  His evidence might be based on his own direct knowledge or on briefing from his officers.  I cannot understand why we should depart from that principle.  If an ordinary community garda happens to have direct knowledge of what is happening on his beat, I do not see why he cannot brief his superior Garda officer to that effect and that a garda of the superior rank would be required to offer what the Minister calls expert opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The Minister's use is different from the classic use of that term.  We speak of expert opinion when a psychiatrist or medical practitioner gives evidence or when a trade union official goes down to say what is the rate in the electrical industry in the middle of a trade dispute.  This is a slightly different use of the term.  If Deputy Flanagan is right about no legal representative being present, it is all the more important that the evidence would be given by a garda of higher rank.  I think that in the giving of opinion about the existence of a criminal organisation the legal representative would be present.  Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that we should depart from the principle established by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_917">If a defendant has legal representation present, which I assume he or she would, could the defendant call every garda in the locality as a witness to testify that he or she is not a member of a criminal organisation?  The Minister says any garda or former garda could be called upon to testify that a person is part of a criminal organisation or that such an organisation exists.  I presume the opposite is true and that a defendant could call gardaí to refute the charge or, at least, cast a doubt on it.</p>

I consider it necessary to specify that the garda giving such evidence should not be below the rank of chief superintendent.  The provision leaves the section, and therefore the Bill, open to constitutional challenge.  If the legislation is referred to the Supreme Court — and I believe it will be — this provision will be struck out, making the legislation entirely redundant.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I am supportive of the Bill.  Among others on this side of the House, I called for this legislation last autumn, when the Minister said it was not necessary.

The Offences against the State Act requires that opinion evidence be given by a chief superintendent or a more senior garda.  The evidence referred to in this section is slightly different.  For a garda to report to a chief superintendent seems a more formal way of achieving the same result.  When the evidence is presented in court it will have gone through the normal procedures within the Garda Síochána.  The term "expert evidence" can be appropriately applied to such evidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_1099">I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">This Bill is such a fundamental revision of the Harbours Act 1996 that it gives us the opportunity to mention the integration of transport networks, particularly between ports and major new road facilities.  On Committee Stage we heard that much of the departmental responsibility for the marine and ports would be transferred to the Department of Transport on the basis that there would be integration.  That is what I seek to do in amendment No. 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">In amendment No. 3, I propose that the traffic separation scheme also be mentioned in the Bill.  The Minister may recall that the Pilots Association mentioned that part of the new boundary is not within the traffic separation scheme in Dublin Bay.  The Minister indicated that he would review ports policy and that we would have a chance to update this five year old document and include provisions on general ports policy and infrastructure.  On that basis, I will withdraw my amendment.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1107">"provided that those activities are clearly beneficial to the harbour in question and to the Irish State".</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">A key aspect of this Bill is to encourage a more dynamic approach to commercial activity in all of the national ports which includes giving ports greater freedom in respect of their investment or commercial activities outside the harbour limits and State ports in certain instances.  The amendment to the 1996 Act states, "the company may invest in or engage in commercial activities outside the limits of the harbour".  My amendment seeks to amend that briefly to prevent some commercial activities, perhaps by way of investment, outside this country becoming the dominant feature of the port company's activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">In amendment No. 6, I seek to amend the guidelines that the Minister is bringing forward to the effect that in making decisions about the acquisition or disposal of land the company must be "fully cognisant of the priority of maintaining port lands in the public interest for public transport uses and for the public good".  That is important given the history of, and recent allegations about, some port activities and the fact that port lands have not been used for beneficial purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">It is important to improve the ability of ports to behave dynamically and the Minister made several comments about that on Second Stage.  Having considered his views as expressed on Committee Stage, I ask him to bear in mind the issues I have raised in both of these amendments but I will withdraw amendment No. 5.</p>

          <p eId="para_1122">A substantial part of this Bill aims to amend the Harbours Act 1996 to enable a Minister effectively to remove democratically elected councillors from the boards of harbour companies and ports and to nominate instead a single member from local government.  It will also give him the power to reduce the number of worker directors to one and to reduce or remove one of the key elements of the 1996 Act.  Labour Party councillors who served on ports and harbour boards did so with great distinction.  The Minister's action is predicated on the fact that the boards are too large and that we must now have eight person boards.  The kind of widespread local democratic representation that we have had over the years is no longer fit for purpose.  I argued the point on Second Stage that many effective boards have more than eight members.  I am not sure what the ideal number of board members would be; the Government has 15 people and there are many other instances of very effective bodies and boards of organisations where there may be ten, 12 or 15 members.  They seem to work best.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that one of the reasons he had to reduce the number of board members was because too many companies had more board members than workers.  Dublin Port has 155 employees and 650 pensioners; Cork has 121 employees and 159 pensioners; Shannon Foynes has 60 employees; Waterford and Dún Laoghaire have 50 employees; Galway has 15 employees; and New Ross and Drogheda have 14 employees.  These are significant companies by any standards and the normal kind of company governance should apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">There are many famous ports which are fairly close to us in this part of the world.  For example, Belfast has 15 board members, four of whom are councillors; Antwerp has 18 board members, ten of whom are councillors; Singapore has a board of 12 members; and the great port of Hamburg has a board of 22, including two worker directors.  The more we look at international comparisons, the less clear the Minister's case becomes.  Overall, the case of removing the right of local authorities to nominate their members as they have selected on to harbour and port boards has not been made by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">There is always the fear that political patronage will become an avenue whereby a Minister in power will be able to nominate members of his own party, and it may be possible that a person being a chairman of a comhairle ceantair, branch of a political party or a constituency party could be a requirement for discharging the office of director in a port company.  That would be a bad and ludicrous position, which we should avoid at all costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">One can consider the very impressive contribution to port companies of local government city and county councillors over recent decades and particularly since 1996.  The Minister's action seems to be a retrograde step.  At the start of this debate we asked to recommit this Bill because the Minister indicated he might have considered avenues whereby the local council would have been able to nominate preferred representatives on to the boards in question.  The Minister indicated he could do this by regulation but there is no amendment to the Bill to this effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">There have been various reviews of the ports back to 2000, with the Packer report being the first to indicate that boards should be smaller.  If one considers effective commercial activity from ports and other companies, smaller port board size is not necessarily the best way forward.  The suspicion continues that decimating the representation of councillors and worker directors on the boards of ports is being done at times to facilitate the Government in permitting ports to move in a way that would be out of the public interest, or where their aims and ambitions would be more removed from the public interest.  In the past there were big agendas regarding the privatisation of ports, and that would fall into the same kind of category.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Worker directors have made an overwhelmingly positive contribution to the development of commercial State ports since the Harbours Act 1996 was implemented.  Worker directors by their nature tend to be people with a profound knowledge of their own port and a deep interest in its work.  Given that worker directors have been some of the most supportive in developing the commercial remit of ports outside their immediate area, it seems to be a retrograde move to cut the size of their contribution to large ports.  Worker directors must go through the democratic process and are elected by colleagues, unlike the rest of the ministerial nominations to boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">These three amendments seek to prevent the Minister from changing the 1996 Act and removing direct democracy from the boards of these large and important local companies by reducing the number of worker directors.  In general terms, this would create a very small and elite board around the chief executive.  The Minister has not made the case, either on Second or Committee Stage, that this will necessarily end up in much more effective governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Ultimately, in our political world, would we be better off with a Government of seven or eight people?  Some might say that we would be and in the current Administration, a number of people would not make that seven or eight.  Most people feel a slightly larger group would be better.  With my own long experience of boards in different areas of the social economy, sport and other sectors, I believe that a board with eight members would be too small and could prevent wider representation and expertise that would enable the organisation to move forward in a better way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I appreciate the Minister considers that in order for ports to have a commercial remit, we must have tighter governance and administration.  We have had complaints about certain actions taken by ports in the past.  I agree with the spirit of adopting that approach but losing local councillors and halving the number of worker directors would be a retrograde step.  As a result, I am proposing these three amendments on behalf of the Labour Party.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1132">There are many good facets to this Bill and the core issue is to make the boards more dynamic and businesslike as organisations.  The number of representatives on boards is to be reduced from 12 to eight and the Bill clearly enunciates a procedure whereby there would be an election among worker directors if the directors of the company declare that more than 30 people will work there in a particular year.  Due provision is being made for a democratic election among workers in a port authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">For the public representatives elected by the people, there is no clarity in the Minister's actions.  On Committee Stage I understood the Minister would think about what we said.  I respect the Minister and I do not believe what he said was anything other than what he believed at the time.  Not having a direct election from the elected local authorities on to the board would fly in the face of what is being done in the Bill for workers and elected representatives generally.  It is making little of them in that it does not recognise their capacity or ability to select from their own number an individual or individuals who have already been elected by the public to represent the local authority and other interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">That such a person would be selected by a local authority as opposed to the Minister would lend greater credibility to the mandate he or she would enjoy.  If he or she is appointed by the Minister — regardless of who might be that Minister — questions will always arise in the context of political issues.  However, if he or she is selected by a local authority, clarity will be brought to the process.  Local authorities already appoint elected members to the boards of various bodies.  If the heart of local democracy is reflected in the fact that directors can come from among the ranks of elected local representatives, it would not be acceptable if absolute clarity were not provided in respect of the process to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">Another issue to which I wish to refer relates to the situation where local authorities that are located adjacent to each other have representatives on a harbour authority.  Louth County Council, Meath County Council and Drogheda Borough Council are represented on Drogheda Harbour Commissioners.   If only one representative is to be selected from among those three local authorities, the Minister of the day will have major difficulties in keeping his supporters at bay on the two authorities that lose out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">The democratic process would benefit if the selection of representatives is made by local authorities.  If the Minister, as seems to be the case, is reducing the number of representatives to one in each case, perhaps a rotation system might be introduced in order that the various local authorities would, at some point, be represented.  I am not sure as to what will be the period of office of the representative but I presume it will be five years.  In such circumstances, a local authority that is represented on the board for a five-year period should not be so represented on the next occasion and the honour should pass to another authority.  I am of the view that this is a fair way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">I accept the need to reduce the numbers serving on the boards.  However, democratically elected representatives who are accountable but who are not appointed by the Minister should be central to the process.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1142">Unfortunately, I was not in a position to make a contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  I have an interest in Fenit Harbour, which is located in my constituency.  I am glad the Minister, more or less, reversed his original intention in respect of amalgamating it with Foynes Harbour.  The latter would not be appropriate and it would be better if Fenit Harbour Commissioners were incorporated as a company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">With regard to representation, Tralee UDC and Kerry County Council have decided who are supposed to be their representatives on the harbour board.  However, these individuals will not take their places on the board in six months' time and instead the Minister will appoint one councillor to serve as representative.  Fine Gael happens to hold a majority on Kerry County Council at present.  It must be the case that whichever party holds the majority on the council — it could be the Minister's party in the future — should have the right to nominate the councillor who will serve as representative.  Surely it would be anti-democratic if the Minister were to go against the wishes of the majority by putting forward his own nominee.  I presume that said individual would not be a member of an Opposition party.  That is not good for democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Fenit Harbour has a great future, both from a commercial and marine recreation point of view.  In that context, I hope the Minister will nominate someone with real expertise to serve on the board.  Perhaps he might look outside the immediate area or even the county to find a suitable person with expertise in running ports.  I reiterate that the Minister's nomination of a person to serve on the board when a majority of the county council might not support that nomination runs contrary to the principle of democracy.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_388" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1145">I thank the Deputies for their comments in respect of these amendments.  Long discussions on the matter to which they relate took place both in the Seanad and at the Select Committee on Transport.  What we are doing is establishing a commercial approach, as outlined in the ports policy statement, in respect of our ports and harbours.  Essentially, we are adopting a model which is different from that to which we have become used with regard to port companies.  Such companies will now have a commercial remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">The ports policy statement indicates that the State will no longer be responsible for financing the various ports and harbours.  The latter will be obliged to provide their own funding when the new regime comes into place.  If we are to make the companies as commercial as possible, we must provide those in charge of them with the wherewithal to achieve this goal.  Of course, this will be subject to the oversight of the boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">At present, boards are comprised of 12 members.  However, as indicated in the ports policy statement, to achieve a streamlined position the number will be reduced to eight.  This will have consequences.  For example, it will not be possible to have three local authority members and two worker directors on a board of eight.  We cannot state that we are determined to implement a commercial approach in respect of the ports and harbours and then leave matters as they currently stand.  An inevitable consequence of moving in the direction we propose to take is that the number of members on the boards will be reduced.  A second consequence is that those who might have been entitled to representation in the past will not enjoy the same level of representation on a smaller board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">We would defeat the entire purpose behind the ports policy if we were to leave matters as they stand, namely, with three councillors and two worker directors on each board.  Attracting only three other directors from elsewhere would not achieve the goal we have set ourselves in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">When they become members of the boards, councillors do not represent their local authorities.  At that stage, they become directors and have fiduciary responsibilities and obligations in respect of the governance of those boards.  These individuals are not appointed to boards to represent the views of the local authorities, they are there to act in the best interests of the port companies.  References to the representation of local authorities or to anti-democratic practices are not accurate in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">On Committee Stage, Members, particularly Deputy O'Dowd, expressed concerns with regard to the fact that there was no indication as to what we might do in respect of local authority directors and how they might be selected.  Deputy O'Dowd also inquired as to what might happen in cases where two or three local authority areas might be located contiguous to a port.  I indicated I would consider those matters and I have been doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">I certainly am minded that instead of the Minister simply selecting someone from the local authorities, I will allow the local authorities to make nominations and to put forward their candidates for a position on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">However, I am somewhat amused that a Minister, who in the first instance is elected directly by the people of a constituency and who then is elected a Minister by the elected representatives of the people in Dáil Éireann, should not have a say in who should be appointed from a local authority to a harbour authority but that the local authority should have that say.  There is a discrepancy in thinking in that regard.  In any event, I made the political point to Deputy Broughan on Committee Stage that while I do not believe that being the chairman of a comhairle ceanntair is an absolutely necessary qualification for a member of the harbour authority, neither do I believe it should disqualify him or her from being such a member.  Similarly, I do not believe that being a member of the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party should either qualify or disqualify one from such a position.  The Deputy is aware that many of these people, regardless of their party, are highly committed community activists who are as entitled to be considered as is anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">However, I do not need to make an amendment to the legislation.  I have given Deputy O'Dowd a commitment that I will come up with a nomination procedure that will allow local authorities to make nominations in respect of the local authority representatives or directors and I will so do.  However, I cannot increase the representation because to do so would distort the balance on the boards, on which it is reasonable to have one local authority member.  Although the Deputy asked that it might be rotated, I am unsure whether so doing would provide the kind of continuity a board should have.  While it may be possible, I have never favoured one year each in the chair of an strategic policy committee or whatever else.  Deputy O'Dowd is familiar with the position in Drogheda, in which there are three local authorities and I would prefer to stipulate that a person would have a minimum term of a couple of years on a board.  However, I will consider the matter to ascertain how I might come up with such a scheme.  I am prepared to provide that the nominations will come from the local authorities and that I will select from their nominations.</p>

I will not delay him any further as he has taken the point, which I welcome.  Democracy will be stronger if this is done, rather than having the Minister of the day appointing whomsoever he or she wishes, because sometimes the Minister would appoint defeated electoral candidates and so on, whereas this clearly will be an elected person from the local authority, which is welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_1155">What protocols are in place in respect of existing boards to which the Minister invites nominees from local authorities?  Does the Minister have an exact model that could be used in this regard?  It is important for Members to have an idea in this regard.  In other words, the Minister will invite a council to provide a nominee and then that nominee, who will have been democratically selected by the council, will become a member of board.  Are there instances within the Department of Transport whereby such a process operates at present?</p>

          <p eId="para_1156">A number of Bills have been enacted containing a stipulation that at least 40% of the composition of a board would be female.  I am on a committee that is examining the role of women in politics at present, of which Senator Ivana Bacik is rapporteur.  I note that whereas Government policy is that it should be 40%, it is not enshrined in the legislation.  I believe the Minister included such a stipulation in an arts Bill some years ago.  Can he provide a commitment that when he appoints these boards, at least 40% of their members will be female or is this another example in which a contradiction exists between Government policy and its failure to incorporate such a commitment in legislation?</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_392" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1157">On Deputy Deenihan's point, it is Government policy that at least 40% of any board should be male or female and this will govern the decisions in this regard.  It is true that such a stipulation has appeared in legislation and I cannot honestly answer as to the reason it is not included in this Bill.  It is included in some items of legislation but not in others.   I always have been a strong advocate of the inclusion of such a provision in legislation and I believe I was the first Minister to make it compulsory.  I actually included a stipulation that it should be 40% when I introduced legislation in respect of the National Council for Special Education.  Part of the difficulty with nominations made by local authorities is that they often will not nominate women and the same is true of trade unions much of the time and, consequently, I seek flexibility in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">As for Deputy Broughan's point, I have not quite worked out how this will be done, except that it will be by invitation.  I will ask each local authority to make nominations and will include a stipulation therein that nominations must be male and female to provide me with the greatest choice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1163">The Minister referred to this issue on Committee Stage, where I raised it at length.  It relates to the leasing arrangements that pertain in some ports and the difficulties that Dublin Port and one or two other ports got into in respect of infirm leases and leases that had deteriorated over the years.  The Minister stated that he would expect to have information on leasing and so on in the company accounts and the annual reports of boards.  Can he specifically indicate to boards, via guidelines, that they should provide an ongoing update on all leasing arrangements?</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">The Minister made the point on Committee Stage that when council representatives go on the boards, they become part of the boards and if they are doing their job, they are no longer directly representing the councils.  This is true and the Minister mentioned on Committee Stage that they are obliged to withdraw during planning discussions and so on.  However, given that the Minister's own nominees have such a function as members of the board, how are people outside the board structure, that is, the people as the ultimate owners of such companies, to know they are being well served unless they get some form of an update in this regard?  I make this point given the history in a number of ports and in Dublin in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_1165">Members had a good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and I will reiterate what I said at that time.  Section 28 of the Harbours Act 1996 contains a detailed list of requirements regarding the information a port company must return to the Minister of the end of each accounting year.  It includes a statement of all significant developments that occurred during the year, including any acquisitions or disposals of land, as well as a statement that the relevant guidelines issued by the Government or the Minister for Finance in respect of their accounts and financial affairs have been adhered to.  The specific provision in the area to which the Deputy referred, which relates to the disposal of land, states explicitly that disposal by means of a lease must be also included in the annual report.  This stipulation exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">I take the points made by the Deputy.  We had a brief conversation following the debate on Committee Stage.  I intend to use my existing powers to request the port companies to furnish me with a full account of the status of all leases held by them.  It can be difficult to get the kind of information one wants from State and semi-State companies.  If it does not work on a voluntary basis, I will include it in a future item of legislation so that we achieve what we are trying to achieve.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1173">"and after all relevant consultation with maritime stakeholders has taken place".</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">These amendments relate to a lengthy discussion we had on Committee Stage about the role of pilots and the perception in the Association of Maritime Pilots of Ireland and other pilot representative bodies that their concerns were not being adequately addressed by the Minister and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">Amendment No. 13 is similar to previous amendments.  Pilotage charges may be imposed by a company in different circumstances and it would be very helpful for pilots and their representative bodies to have a statutory right to be consulted in these circumstances.  I sought to amend section 13 by inserting this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">Amendment No. 14 concerns an issue that goes to the heart of the concerns of pilots.  This section refers to lengthy representation and correspondence between the Association of Maritime Pilots of Ireland, the Minister and Department in respect of the retirement age of 60, which was introduced by the 1996 Act.  Many view it as grotesquely unfair.  This has been the subject of numerous representations, correspondence and meetings between the Association of Marine Pilots of Ireland and the Department.  It is felt that there is an authoritarian rule whereby an age limit of 60 was introduced arbitrarily.  It goes against the interests of good pilotage.  Given the importance of pilots to the safe administration of ports, this is a grievous blow to able and fit pilots over the age of 60 and introduces an element of discrimination.  There was no such requirement for an age limit before 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">We had a lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage.  We discussed compulsory retirement and the issue of a senior garda taking a case in the courts on this matter.  We discussed how our attitudes to this area are different and referred to the European directive.  The 1996 Act introduced unfair discrimination against pilots and we should have considered this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">I have correspondence from Mr. Bob Kieran, chairperson of the Association of Maritime Pilots of Ireland.  He understood that the Minister had given a commitment to remove the compulsory retirement age in this legislation.  The Minister told us on Committee Stage that it could not be done but gave a commitment to table an amendment to this effect in the Merchant Shipping Bill, which is before this House and will be discussed in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">We voted on recommitting this Bill because I was not sure that this was the case or whether we can look forward to this anomaly and injustice against marine pilots being removed from legislation in the Merchant Shipping Bill.  Mr. Kieran and others asked why we must wait for the Merchant Shipping Bill and why we cannot do this tonight.  The Minister can insert an amendment to this effect, remove the arbitrary limit of 60 years of age and return it to 65.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">Amendment No. 15 is based on correspondence with marine pilots who raised concerns about the levels of insurance they must have if we increase fines by a particular amount.  A major insurance problem will emerge.  I sought to remove this by removing the section.  Amendment No. 16 concerns the possibility of the junior officer being in charge of the navigational watch and getting a pilot's exemption, which seems to be an unsafe practice.  The amendment seeks to remove a navigational watch officer from having pilot exemption.  The Minister said that this would be for a very small vessels.  It seems to introduce nonsense in respect of safe pilotage in our major ports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">Amendment No. 17 refers to the holder of a subsisting document issued by another member state of the European Communities, the Kingdom or Norway or the Republic of Iceland and the fact that such a person would have the highest standards in internationally recognised pilotage qualifications and medical fitness so that there is an absolute standard for pilots.  Amendment No. 18 is similar to amendment No. 13, proposing that certain developments will take place only after consultation with pilots.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">Amendment No. 19. proposes that we adopt the international standard for pilotage organisations.  This is a key group of maritime marine workers.  Many of us represent marine constituencies.  Many pilots feel they have been badly treated, particularly in respect of the age limit but also in respect of consultation.  I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">Under section 18 of the Harbours Act 1996, provision is made for the transfer of harbour authorities to local authority control by ministerial order in cases where there is little or no commercial traffic.  The ports policy statement provides that in cases where there is significant commercial traffic, consideration will be given to bringing the relevant harbours under the control of a port company.  This is relevant to two harbour authorities, namely, Bantry Bay, and Tralee and Fenit.  The proposed amendment will allow flexibility in legislation to provide for their transfer to either local authority control or to local port company control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">What is wrong with the vibrant Bantry Harbour Board which was established 25 years ago?  I want an assurance from the Minister tonight that Bantry Harbour Board will act as its own harbour authority.  Will the Minister provide this assurance in view of the consideration we gave him on Committee Stage last week when he was trying to get us to unanimously agree to withdraw the amendments tabled?  He stated that he would be flexible with regard to them on Report Stage.  Furthermore, I have a very serious view on these amendments because of the Minister's behaviour in that we are here tonight under false pretences; the Minister misled the select committee to have the Bill at this Stage before the House tonight.  Is he trying to slide it in at this late hour under the shadow of darkness on one of the shortest nights of the year?</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">I remind the Minister that he was facing 19 amendments tabled by me and Deputies O'Dowd and Broughan on Bantry Harbour in sections 18 and 19 of the Bill.  On Committee Stage, having taken one vote on the first of my amendments, amendment No. 22, which the Minister won with the most slender of margins, he was facing a further 18 amendments.  Tonight, it seems to me that with all the dexterity of a three-card trickster the Minister misled the select committee——</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">In view of the Minister's commitment, Deputies O'Dowd, Broughan and I agreed to the withdrawal of the other 18 amendments.

The time is right to not let the people on the harbour board live in cloud cuckoo land; give them the right to proceed immediately and the authority to mind and cater for their own business.  It will not cost the Minister €1 and all I will say is that the Minister should act on the promise he made to us last week on Committee Stage and grant us this opportunity to copperfasten the status of Bantry Harbour Authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_1204">——but at this stage I am very happy to support the approach he made on the local harbour commissioners.  On a very serious level, this commission has worked very well for many years.  It has operated efficiently and effectively and has run at a profit; we have had the oil imports into the terminal at Whiddy Island which has been a major consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">The question is whether it is to be absorbed into the Port of Cork.  The Port of Cork is a very fine company running the Port of Cork but Bantry is 60 miles from Cork and we really do not have a huge notion at the far end of west Cork of being merely an outpost of the Port of Cork.  The Minister has gone some bit of the way in the amendments he introduced in the Seanad and he has spoken about consultation and so on but at the end of the day that is not sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">It is literally five minutes to midnight as it is metaphorically with regard to the Bill.  I strongly suggest that if Bantry Bay Harbour Commission was to be accepted as agreeing to it then that is fine with me.  However, if the approach is merely to have a public consultation prior to its being abolished then that is not acceptable in west Cork.  The answer is in the amendment which requires that any approach on the ending of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commission should be with its approval.  If the Bantry Bay Harbour Commission agrees then that is fine with me but if it does not then it should be allowed to continue on an independent basis.  That is my plea by way of support for the excellent case that I will not even try to match made by Deputy Sheehan.  I strongly support the approach he has made.  Coming from west Cork like Deputy Sheehan, I believe the Minister should take into account the strong views of the local representatives in that regard and go along with the approach we propose.</p>

          <p eId="para_1210">Deputy Broughan made several points that we rehearsed very carefully on Committee Stage and I do not want to rehash them.  The Deputy was very specific in the queries he raised on the age specified and whether we can change it from 60 to 65.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">As I explained on Committee Stage and reiterated here, it was the intent of my colleague, the former Minister of State Deputy Noel Ahern, to try to amend this following consultation with the representative bodies.  He fully intended to change the age limit for marine pilots, but when he started trying to change it, the parliamentary draftsmen in the Office of the Attorney General raised a number of serious issues.  These relate to health and safety, pension rights and contracts, etc., and it was not possible in the time available, and because of the other pressures of the Bill, to make progress in that area.  I know that is a disappointment for the Deputies opposite who raised the matter and for marine pilots.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">I undertake to remedy the situation as quickly as I can and I give a commitment now to do that, even though my notes use the word "probably".

          <p eId="para_1215">With regard to the other matters, in section 13 there is already a well established system for harbour and pilotage charges.  I do not intend to change that or to accept the amendment regarding inserting a specific reference to consultation.  That is already implicit in the Acts and happens in effect.  We dealt with the other amendments and for the reasons outlined on Committee Stage, I do not intend to accept them.  I fully accept we have made a commitment on pilots and we will abide by that commitment and bring in that change as quickly as we can.</p>

On foot of that, I warmly welcome the commitment given by the Minister.  It must be said, one only has to listen to such a distinguished Deputy as Deputy P. J. Sheehan to realise how wonderful it is to have his kind of experience, eloquence and expertise available to the Dáil and to our profession.  The element of experience with regard to key professions such as marine pilots is critical.  I welcome the proposed change and look forward to it being in the next legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">With regard to the other amendments, the key element running through all of them was to ensure that there would be adequate consultation with pilots on the matters that would arise regarding the national ports.  I hope the Minister bears this in mind when considering the limits of a port, boundaries, safety concerns and how visiting mariners are allowed to perform when in our ports, etc.  All of these should be matters on which the Minister would liaise closely with the pilots.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">I note from correspondence that the Department officials have been liaising closely with pilots, but perhaps this could be done on a more formal basis.  I mentioned that before 1996 we had pilotage committees in each of the ports.  There was no necessity to remove those committees following the 1996 Act, but they were allowed to fall into disuse.  I urge the Minister to bring them back.  There is probably still a statutory basis for them and we could bring them back.</p>

          <p eId="para_1229">I thank the Deputies for their passionate pleas on this issue.  As Deputy Sheehan said, I indicated on Committee Stage that I would give very careful thought to this matter before Report Stage.  I take issue with the Deputy in saying that I made any commitment other than to consider his passionate and carefully worded statement on Committee Stage.  I do not wish to reignite the debate, but despite his passionate pleas, I cannot change the particular provision in the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_1231">What I am trying to do here is to provide an added option when the future of Bantry Bay, Tralee and Fenit is considered.  All this Bill will allow us to do when enacted is allow that a Minister may establish a private company in respect of the harbour, may transfer control to a relevant local authority or, subject to a statutory consultation period, transfer control to a port company control.  That is all that is being included.  It is an enabling provision to give the maximum freedom to somebody in the future with regard to what will happen in the case of both Bantry and Fenit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">I understand the views well articulated here by Deputies P. J. Sheehan and Jim O'Keeffe with regard to the desire to retain small, independent harbour boards.  This is admirable in the context of local pride.  However, it runs contrary to what members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport have repeatedly stated when questioning the executives of State commercial port companies.  They have repeatedly stressed the benefits of mergers and amalgamations and port companies have been asked to explore the possibilities created from such mergers.  In this particular case, all Members would recognise the benefits to be gained in areas such as marketing, piloting, dredging and increased operational efficiencies from a merger between a regional harbour with significant commercial trades and a port company.  However, that is for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">I acknowledge the contributions made by all sides to this debate.  I am convinced the amendments provided here will provide a Minister with the maximum scope in deciding the future of the harbour.  It is with great reluctance that, despite the eloquent pleas, I will not be able to accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_435">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_1364">I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise the concerns of the community in Cork about the escalating use of heroin.  There has been some very high profile media coverage of the problem in recent days.  However, it is an issue of which those of us who read the local press, discuss the matter with the Garda and speak to local health professionals have been aware for quite some time.  The list of those seeking methadone treatment is growing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">Heroin use is growing in the Cork area and there is a fear that it will attract the violence associated with that drug.  There has been a recorded increase in drug related burglaries in the Cork area.  The Garda set up a dedicated heroin unit in Cork in 2006 in response to the growing problem.  The number of heroin detections in 2004 was four but last year that number rose to 159, a fortyfold increase.  There were six heroin related deaths in 2007, eight in 2008 and, alarmingly and tragically for the families of those involved, there have been four such deaths in the past five weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">There has been a very large increase in the number of addicts seeking treatment, with more than 100 people treated in 2008.  It is estimated there are 150 people on the waiting list for methadone treatment in Arbour House, which I visited recently along with the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, when he opened the refurbished facility.  The Minister of State will be well aware of the excellent service provided by health professionals in the treatment centre.  Certain people must wait for more than one year for methadone treatment and during that year those addicts will undoubtedly continue to use the drug, to put their health at risk and continue to place stress on their families as they struggle to find the estimated €100 to €300 per day necessary to feed the habit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">A consultant in emergency medicine in Cork University Hospital has warned of an increasing number of heroin and methadone cases.  He also warned the problem will escalate and that by this time next year Cork will have a serious heroin problem.  All the signs, evidence and figures are available.  We do not wish to see such a drug problem develop with all the negative social consequences it would entail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">All of this takes place against a background of a cut in the budget of the local drugs task force of 20%.  Is there a central solution to such a problem?  Having to wait for treatment for more than one year is unacceptable, and it is also unacceptable that there is only one doctor available for those in need of methadone treatment.  The Garda and the local drugs task force must be involved along with health professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">I am conscious that this is taking place in the context of the very gloomy economic background against which we live at present.  However, the long-term social consequences, havoc and devastation that this drug can wreak on communities will undoubtedly result in a much higher financial cost and social cost and this must be factored into today's thinking.  All the warnings are available.  I have outlined them and they have been heard loud and clear by communities in Cork.  I call on the Minister to do what he can to support the health professionals, the Garda and those working on the ground to ensure the drug use does not escalate to epidemic proportions as predicted.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_436">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1370">I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for affording us this opportunity to clarify the position.  I will begin by setting out the national context with regard to this issue before dealing with the  specific situation in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">At a national level, the HSE provides treatment and rehabilitation services for those misusing opiates and other drugs through a combination of direct provision by the HSE staff, or by voluntary agencies which it funds to provide services on its behalf.  There is also a wide range of partnerships with community-based groups and agencies.  Individuals presenting for treatment for opiate-related issues are provided with a full and comprehensive assessment of both medical and psychosocial needs.  The range of interventions includes assessment, stabilisation, harm reduction measures, care planning, methadone maintenance, counselling and detoxification, either in specialist clinics, in residential settings or in a community setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">It should be noted that due to the complexity of this client group, people will enter and re-enter services and may need interventions on more than one occasion.  The funding committed to addiction services has increased year-on-year over the lifetime of the National Drug Strategy 2001-2008.  In 2008, €101.87 million was spent by the HSE on specific addiction services, both those directly provided by the HSE and those which it funded.  This represents an increase of over €45.9 million from 2001 levels of funding.  In addition, it should be noted that HSE mainstream services such as accident and emergency services, acute hospitals and mental health services address the treatment needs of alcohol and other substance misusers who avail of them.  The cost of these services is not included in the figures which I have already quoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">The numbers of people receiving treatment continue to rise and additional services continue to develop, with an additional 3,686 methadone treatment places from 2001 to 2008.  In addition, needle exchange services have been developed in 13 local drug task force areas and five regional drug task force areas covering the areas most affected by opiate misuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Training needs have also been addressed.  The establishment of the national addiction training programme, in partnership with Waterford Institute of Technology and the community and voluntary sectors, has resulted in the upskilling of 1,645 front line staff.  This training has enabled the HSE addiction service to respond to the changing trends in prevalence — for example, polydrug use, cocaine use and the misuse of alcohol as well as maintaining a focus on opiate abuse.  The HSE, as the lead agency, has commenced the implementation of the report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, which was published in May 2007, by establishing the national drug rehabilitation implementation committee and employing a national senior rehabilitation co-ordinator. This committee is developing a rehabilitation framework for all addiction services, as recommended in the report and it is building on co-ordination arrangements already in place in a number of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">With regard to the situation in Cork, there are currently 85 clients in methadone substitution treatment in Arbour House clinic in Cork.  The medical officers attached to Arbour House clinic commence assessment and treatment planning on the first contact with the client.  The assessment process can take up to three weeks.  Currently there are 106 opiate users on the waiting list for treatment in Arbour House.  However, within this, some people may be prioritised for clinical reasons — for example, pregnant women.  Regional drug co-ordinators in HSE south are working with the national GP co-ordinator to increase the number of level one and level two general practitioners in the methadone treatment service.  An additional GP has been providing services in Arbour House since January 2009 which has enabled an increased number of sessions to be provided for clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">To further address the issue of waiting times, the HSE, with the assistance of minor capital grants provided by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is developing additional methadone clinics in a number of locations — including Cork city. It is expected that this additional clinic in Cork city will be operational in late 2009 or early 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">The HSE acknowledges the challenges with respect to waiting times for treatment in certain parts of the country where drug usage has increased significantly in recent years.  It points out that while there are approximately 600 clients on waiting lists, more than 10,000 clients received methadone treatment in 2008.  Overall, the Minister for Health and Children considers that progress is being made in this area both nationally and in the context of services being provided and developed in the Cork area.</p>

          <heading>Rural Transport Scheme.</heading>
          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_437">
            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_1378">I was prompted to raise this issue in response to calls to my office and to Deputy Brian O'Shea's office with regard to the probable cessation of the rural bus service between Waterford and Cork.  This is a service which specifically serves the towns of Dungarvan, Cappoquin, Lismore, Curraglass, Ballynoe, Conna, Castlelyons, Fermoy, Castletownroche, Killavullen and Mallow.  There is a concern that if the mid-day service which is provided by Bus Éireann is stopped, because in the company's words it is deemed to be "not profitable", this will have an untold consequence for those people who are older, who do not have their own transport and who would normally use this service to access general day to day services such as medical, post office and other services that generally keep life and limb together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">I am concerned because if it is the case that Bus Éireann decides to terminate this service, then in the current economic climate, there is no guarantee that the rural transport programme would be sufficiently funded to replace the route and provide the service to what I would call a vulnerable section or our society who do not have the means to provide their own transport and are not in a position to be able to get taxis if they are living in rural areas to the towns I have mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">We saw in 1967 that the railway line between Mallow and Dungarvan or Cork and Waterford through Mallow was stopped and it was replaced by a bus service.  I am arguing now, along with my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, that there would be a public service obligation to ensure that those people would continue to be served by some form of public transport and ideally through the auspices of Bus Éireann.  It is my view that if we are to go down the line in this country of stopping routes which are deemed to be not profitable, then it will be another nail in the coffin for rural society.  At a time when we are talking about the sustainability of the rural economy and rural society, it is vitally important that we would ensure that Bus Éireann and other providers would continue to have some obligation to provide services, particularly during the week when it is predominantly elderly people who avail of these services.  It is not only so that they can go into town to purchase groceries but it is also a form of social interaction for them they may not otherwise have without the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">If Government policy is one that assures that rural transport would be well catered for, particularly in more isolated areas, and if it is the case that Government policy is such that there is a service in existence, I call on the Minister to ensure that the service is maintained, preferably by Bus Éireann, but if not, that the Minister would intervene directly with Bus Éireann to ensure that it is maintained.  That will ensure that if we get rid of the railways we do not also get rid of the rural bus routes.  People use this service and it is vital that they have access to the services that maintain them in their everyday lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">I call on the Minister to intervene directly with Bus Éireann on this issue and ensure we maintain that service and other such services that are being threatened.  Bus Éireann is undergoing a process of reviewing its routes and those deemed to be not profitable could cease in the future.  That would be a bad day for rural society and the rural economy in particular.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_438" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_1383">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter, although he strayed somewhat from the subject of the Adjournment matter on the rural transport programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to the rural transport that underpins the rural transport programme launched in February 2007.  The principal function of the rural transport programme is to address social exclusion in rural areas arising from public transport needs.  It was not established to provide regular inter-urban transport services.  That is the function of Bus Éireann and other commercial transport operators.  It is a clear principle of the programme that services are to complement and not compete with the existing public transport services provided either by CIE companies or by the private transport operators.  Older people and people with disabilities form the core customer base of the rural transport programme, with many of those people living in remote and isolated rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">The programme mainstreamed the former pilot rural transport initiative, and provides significantly increased funding which has led to additional services and expanded area coverage.  The bottom-up approach developed during the pilot rural transport initiative demonstrated the effectiveness of community and voluntary innovation and participation in the provision of rural transport services.  The programme is building on that concept and the main drivers of community rural transport continue to be the local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">As Deputies will be aware, Pobal administers the programme on behalf of my Department and is working with 37 individual rural transport groups around the country to address social exclusion in their rural areas arising from public transport needs.  The programme is now operational in every county and the rural transport groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas on a phased basis in response to local public transport service needs and having regard to the availability of resources.  The programme has been highly successful.  In 2008, 146,000 services were operated and 1.2 million passenger journeys were recorded.  The equivalent figures for 2007 were 120,000 services and 998,000 passenger journeys.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The arrangements for the provision of services funded under the programme are a matter for individual rural community transport groups because we believe that local communities know best where the transport needs are in their rural areas and how best to address those needs.  The Government's role is one of facilitator, helping local communities to address their transport needs through financial and administrative support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">Funding of €11 million is being provided from the Department of Transport Vote for the rural transport programme in 2009, an increase of €1 million on the provision for 2008.  It is envisaged that this funding will lead to small increases this year in the frequency of existing services.  In making specific allocations to the individual rural transport groups from this funding, Pobal has been asked by my Department to work closely with the groups to maximise the impact of the funding as well as ensuring continued value for money.  Some groups are working at a local level with the Health Service Executive, FÁS, the vocational education committees and a number of disability organisations with a view to achieving transport synergies and getting better value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">In addition to funding from my Department, rural transport groups also benefit each year from funding provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arising from the application of the free travel scheme.  Some groups also benefit from local development funding from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, while most groups also generate additional funds from their own resources.  The scheme will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">Regarding the Bus Éireann services, Bus Éireann is currently in negotiations in the Labour Relations Commission.  I do not want to go into detail on that but it is not the policy of Bus Éireann to cease services that are not profitable.  Quite a few of its services are not profitable and it gets a public service obligation, PSO, for that but to discontinue services that are poorly used or under utilised, in the context of trying to secure a cut in its losses of €30 million, it must look at every individual service it provides and I have no doubt this will give an opportunity to rural transport groups to fill in gaps in the years ahead.</p>

          <heading>Flood Relief.</heading>
          <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_439">
            <from>Deputy Beverley Flynn</from>
            <p eId="para_1391">I welcome an opportunity to raise this matter.  Last Monday in County Mayo I spent five hours going around looking at the serious damage caused by a flood.  This happened as a result of exceptional rainfall which occurred on the evening of 2 July.  Information provided by the Met Office indicated that 60 millimetres of rain fell in the Newport area alone between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., and during the most intense period a total of 41.6 millimetres fell in one 60 minute period.  This is extremely unusual and I gather it has an annual exceedence probability of one in 150 and therefore is very rare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">The resulting flash floods caused extensive damage in several areas.  Newport, Furnace, Keenagh, Glenisland and parts of Tourmakeady were severely damaged as a result of the floods.  There were landslides in both of those areas and a great deal of damage done to roads, bridges, land, livestock and even a group water scheme.  The Buckagh group water scheme in the Newport area servicing 34 houses was put out of action.  Some houses are still waiting to be reconnected to their water supply and when their sole source of water is a mountain stream, one can imagine the quality of the water they have currently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">In the Newport, Furnace and Keenagh areas in particular, the Yellow River Bridge was damaged and Treanlaur Lodge had damage to the road.  The Buckagh road had extensive damage.  Treenbeg Road had a lot of damage.  The Leena and Glendavoolagh Roads, Newport town, Glenhest Road and Quay Road all proved impassible on the night in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">Mayo County Council and the fire services were mobilised and they put into place a temporary measure to make the roads passable, and by Friday and Saturday of last weekend most of the roads were passable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">In the Newport area alone, costings have been done for the damage that has occurred to bridges in the area and it has been costed at €400,000.  In the Glenisland area we would be looking at costings of a similar amount but as yet they have not established if some of the bridges will remain stable.  It may take another week to establish that so further costings will be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">In the past I approached the Minister for emergency funding following flooding in the Ballinrobe area and he was good enough to provide €200,000 this year under a miscellaneous provision to assist with that.  What happened in this area last weekend is very unusual and, having been accompanied on my trip by the county council engineers, Ann Sweeney and Shane O'Donnell, and by local farmers, Seamus O'Donnell and Gerard Nolan, I saw that the extent of the damage was unbelievable.  Roads were ripped up, there were craters in the road and the amount of repair work that will have to be done is extensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">The Minister will also be aware that the council budget for this type of work this year has been trimmed to the minimum.  When the full costings are made available to him I ask the Minister to consider providing emergency funding, as an exceptional item, to Mayo County Council to deal with this job.  I will talk also to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to ask him to provide assistance to the farmers who lost extensive fencing and livestock.  Many sheep were lost and a huge amount of damage was done to land and private property generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue and I ask the Minister to engage with the county council to discuss the possibility of his Department providing some assistance.  If some of the bridges prove to be unstable, as I believe they will, the council will not have the necessary funds to carry out repair work this year.  All of these bridges are on roads which service rural communities.  Many of the families have been cut off and major work will be required in the near future. I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_1399">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I also take the opportunity to express my sympathy to all those who have been affected by the recent flooding in County Mayo, outlined by Deputy Flynn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">In September 2004, the Government confirmed the Office of Public Works as the State's lead agency in flooding, to be tasked with delivering an integrated, multifaceted programme aimed at mitigating future flood risk and impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">As regards flooding of roads, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a matter for the relevant local authority, to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  The initial selection of works to be funded from these grants is also a matter for the local authority.  Funding of national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the allocation made to local authorities is inclusive of the weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.  That stipulation is contained clearly in the circular letter sent with the allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">In 2009, grants totalling €22.316 million were allocated to Mayo County Council for works on regional and local roads.  This included a discretionary maintenance grant of €1.952 million and a discretionary improvement grant of €826,000, which are available at the discretion of Mayo County Council to fund contingency works arising from weather conditions.  My Department would also be prepared to consider sympathetically any request from Mayo County Council to adjust its multi-annual restoration programmes in order to prioritise work necessitated by severe weather conditions.  In 2009, Mayo County Council was allocated a restoration improvement grant of €7.638 million and a restoration maintenance grant of €5.614 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">It should also be noted that Mayo County Council's own resources expenditure on regional and local roads in 2008 amounted to €5.4 million, which represented only 15% of the total expenditure on regional and local roads in the county, with the other 85% funded by State road grants.  The expenditure of €5.4 million in 2008 is also €1.95 million less than the council spent from its own resources in 2007.  Mayo County Council needs to address this issue with a view to assigning more of its own resources to the regional and local road network.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1405">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">We all take the Ombudsman's report very seriously.  When the Ombudsman addresses the issues I am about to raise we should take it even more seriously.  She maintains that out of the 2,747 formal complaints made last year, only six related to the Disability Act 2005.  She expressed her concern that this is a remarkably low level of complaint.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">She observes that many public servants have a serious lack of knowledge about their responsibilities under the Disability Act 2005.  Despite having made similar comments in the past number of years, it appears that very little has been done to address this, despite the obligations of the Act.  She states that if people with disabilities do not have information easily available to let them know how to make a complaint against a public body, then it is no surprise that complaints from them remain remarkably low, year on year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">Does the Minister agree there is inaction among many public bodies in taking their duties under the Disability Act seriously enough and specifically in tackling the knowledge gap among their staff about their responsibilities under the Act?  A code of practice for public bodies about their responsibilities under the Act was developed by the National Disability Authority, but many public bodies seem to be unaware of its existence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The Ombudsman highlights the failure of public bodies to establish an adequate and effective complaints procedure through disability access officers, covered under section 26 of the Act.  These are supposed to assist clients with disabilities in accessing public buildings, services and information which has led to people with disabilities simply not being able to seek assistance.  The lack of information about access officers has led people to make what are classified as premature complaints to the Ombudsman. These are complaints made before using the complaints mechanism of the public body concerned as this complaints system remains inaccessible to people with disabilities.  In fact, of the 105 websites surveyed by the Ombudsman, only 20, that is 19%, contained information about access officers and for many of these, ease of access to the information proved difficult.  Only five of the websites surveyed contained information about how to make a complaint specifically in relation to the failure of the body to comply with Part 3 of the Disability Act.  As the Minister's Department is charged  with monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the Disability Act, in particular measures in relation to Part 3 and Part 5 dealing with the public sector, I ask him what will be done to address this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">This is a serious issue when coupled with the failure of the Government to introduce a personal advocacy service through the Citizens Information Board.  When legislation was passed it was envisaged that a personal advocate would assist people with disabilities in accessing all public services, not just health services, and acting as their representative in dealing with public bodies if they were unable to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">Would the Minister agree that these failures undermine the statutory right of people with disabilities to complain where public bodies fail in their duty to them?  I agree with the Ombudsman, and I am sure many people with disabilities, their carers, families would agree, that this situation is "wholly unacceptable".  When the Ombudsman uses language as strong as that we should all take note and act to protect vulnerable citizens in their endeavours to secure the services to which they are entitled under the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this very important issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_442" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_1413">I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has asked me to reply to the Deputy on his behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">I wish to outline the comprehensive policy and strategy that is in place in this area.  The National Disability Authority, NDA, received a formal request from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, to develop a code of practice on accessible information and services to support public bodies in meeting their new statutory obligations under the Disability Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">In September 2005, the NDA engaged in consultations with Government Departments that would be impacted by the code and by October 2005 had developed an early draft code.  This draft code was circulated to over 600 stakeholders, including representatives of persons with disabilities and was also advertised in the national press with a general call for comment.  As a result of this consultation phase, an advanced draft of the code was prepared and circulated to Government Departments for final comment.  The code of practice was finalised and submitted to the Minister in late 2005 and was declared an approved code of practice under the Disability Act 2005 in April 2006 under Statutory Instrument No. 163 of 2006.  The code of practice was launched in July 2006 as part of the national disability strategy and this launch was attended by the Taoiseach and seven Government Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">In presenting the code, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that the code was intended to support public bodies in meeting their new statutory obligations under the Disability Act and would provide public bodies with general guidance and practical examples of how they might approach it.  To ensure that public bodies were aware of the code, the NDA organised a series of regional briefings on it in October 2006 and circulated copies of the code to each of the then 570 public bodies impacted by it.  The NDA code of practice was also presented at the 15th annual European social services network conference held in Berlin in June 2007 at which considerable interest was shown in the scope and content of Ireland's national disability strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">At the recent annual conference for access officers held 3 May, presentations on improving accessibility of information were made by the ESB and Mayo County Council.  The Railway Procurement Agency and Monaghan County Council presented on accessible procurement processes in line with section 27 of the Disability Act and Cork County Council and the Department of Social and Family Affairs presented on improving accessibility of websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">To establish the most appropriate way to monitor implementation of the code of practice, the NDA commissioned preliminary independent research.  This research was conducted in consultation with all key stakeholders and indicated that the best approach would be a self-report monitoring survey.  Accordingly, the NDA developed a draft monitoring questionnaire.  Following extensive consultations with 15 Departments, 568 public bodies and representative groups for persons with disabilities, a finalised questionnaire was issued for completion by public bodies in April 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">The findings of the NDA's 2008 monitoring survey provide ample evidence of awareness of statutory requirements and commitment to providing accessible information and services among the public bodies that made returns.  However, it must be borne in mind that non-responses may well be indicative of some lack of completeness or confidence in implementation and compliance achieved at the time of the survey, which is part of the Deputy's point.  It should also be noted that some organisations that have recently been established and are newly impacted by the code were included in the survey.  Such organisations will require some time to identify properly and address fully all of the accessibility issues that will pertain to the services and information they have been established to provide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">Among public bodies that made returns on the survey, many important achievements have been observed.  Notable examples of best practice were observed in respect of some particular organisations and actions.  Notwithstanding this, a small number of important areas of underachievement requiring attention were also identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">In so far as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is concerned, in 2006 the Department prepared an accessibility action plan to set out the steps it is taking to deliver accessible public services.  This elaborates on the general commitments in the Department's customer charter and takes into account its obligations under the Disability Act 2005.  The Department has also formed a disability advisory committee with a view to improving access to public services provided by the Department for people with disabilities.  The committee comprises representatives from a number of relevant divisions within the Department.  To provide additional expert input, the Department's disability policy division also participates in this exercise.  The remit of the committee does not extend to the public bodies under the Department's aegis, but there are proposals to ensure liaison with such agencies with a view to pooling experience in this field.  The Department also has a disability liaison officer, an accommodation officer and access officers to monitor services for people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">In consultation with OPW and other parties, the Department intends to undertake regular reviews of its accommodation and related accessibility issues in its facilities and services and will carry out reasonable modifications to improve access to its accommodation.  To date, the measures taken to improve accessibility include modifications to the built environment, disability awareness training for departmental staff and website redevelopment.  The Deputy will appreciate from what I have stated that a considerable amount of work and attention is being given to promoting the code of practice and ensuring implementation.  That work will continue and I am sure that account will be taken by all concerned of what the Ombudsman has stated in her annual report.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1427">A properly functioning banking sector is an essential element for the maintenance and development of enterprises, especially SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Government focus has been on creating a fit for purpose banking system as is evidenced by the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  Substantial guarantees and funding have been committed to the banking sector in order to keep the banks functioning to support the broader economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">A key principle of all these actions is the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly in relation to SMEs.  SMEs are central to our economy and the provision of bank credit to the sector is a primary target of all these initiatives.  The Banks' Recapitalisation Package contains a range of initiatives to directly assist our enterprise sector, including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.  This should ensure that sound businesses will receive support from their banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">A €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds. Much of this funding will flow to small and medium enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">SMEs are also covered by the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  This Code which was published by the Financial Regulator came into effect from 13 March 2009.  The application of the Code will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will also provide funding for SMEs on foot of €300m facilities provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">My colleague the Minister for Finance has responsibility for the banking system and the Tánaiste and I are in regular contact with him on the matter as are officials of both our Departments.  In addition the Tánaiste and I have met with the business representative bodies, the banks and the enterprise support agencies to ensure that all sides have a common understanding of the issues and a common commitment to support viable businesses.    We will continue with these contacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">The recapitalised banks agreed to pay for and co-operate with the carrying out of an Independent Review of Bank Lending to SMEs.  Additional banks have now participated in this Review with the result that the 5 major lending banks are now included. The purpose of the review is to ascertain the position on credit availability to SMEs here and to recommend appropriate action to improve credit availability. The Independent Review has now been submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and will be published immediately.  I welcome the completion of this Review as it should allow all stakeholders have an objective view of the state of lending from the banks to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Arising from the Recapitalisation Package, the Tánaiste, along with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, also established a Credit Supply Clearing Group with bank, business (including ISME and SFA) and State representation.  This Group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.  The Group is however, not an appeals mechanism for cases where credit has been refused by the banks. Individual business decisions remain the responsibility of the banks. The Credit Supply Clearing Group is being chaired by my Department and will work to provide a clear picture of any emerging lending patterns while facilitating direct discussion by all the relevant interests in addressing problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">The Group met for the first time on 28 May 2009 and will meet again shortly following the publication of the Independent Review of Bank Credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">To assist and complement the work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, I personally have held seven regional meetings beginning in Cork on Monday 29 June to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the state sector, their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level. I have to date, held meetings in Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Bundoran, Shannon, Galway and Athlone. The last meeting will be held in Dundalk on Monday next 13 July. In the course of these meetings, I met with local representatives of the major banks, business representatives from local Chambers of Commerce, ISME, SFA, IFA and the Irish Hotels Federation. Local representatives from the various State Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, City and County Enterprise Boards and Fáilte Ireland, also attended.  The outcome of theses meetings should facilitate a greater understanding of the issue at both regional and national levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">Outside of the banking sphere, my Department's continuous support for enterprises arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009 for the development agencies ensures that we can continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">Government has also introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments to their business suppliers from 30 to 15 calendar days. This commitment has effect on all valid invoices received on and from 15 June 2009 and should help ease cash flow difficulties for SMEs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1443">I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 65 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">When issues of concern relating to expenditure in FÁS were brought to my attention following my appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year, I acted quickly to seek assurances from FÁS that the issues highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report had been addressed.  I then proceeded to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out an examination of the activities of FÁS Corporate Affairs since 2000 and to report on the effectiveness of management and control systems across the FÁS organisation.  I have recently received a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General that deals with the examination of advertising and promotion in FÁS, which forms part of this investigation.  This report will be laid before the House in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">The report is being examined by officials in my Department and will be laid before the House, as required under Section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">I understand from the Comptroller and Auditor General that a further report will be issued in the coming months, which will examine the arrangements for internal control and governance that pertained in FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">In the meantime, a number of measures have been taken by FÁS in order to improve financial control and governance across the organisation.  These include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">The Corporate Affairs function, which is at the centre of the C&amp;AG's investigation, has been restructured and controls in this area have been tightened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">The Board of FÁS has approved a revised structure for its Internal Audit including resources for additional staff and external co-sourced audits.  An external quality review of its Internal Audit has also been completed and a number of recommendations have been made that identify how the function can develop in line with best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">A full audit of all procurement locations has been scheduled by FÁS Internal Audit for completion by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">All executive credit cards have been cancelled. The one credit card retained by FÁS has a maximum credit limit of €7,000 and is used primarily to purchase research material, textbooks, and other support material to assist the work of the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">All foreign travel requests by staff are now subject to the approval of the Director General of FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The FÁS advertising budget has been reduced to a minimum and a new communications strategy will be developed to ensure efficient customer communications.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1455">I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed by some commentators in relation to the recent initiative by the retailer concerned to change the manner in which it sources certain products. The Deputy will appreciate that issues in relation to the strategies employed by businesses, including in the area of sourcing supplies, are primarily matters for the businesses themselves. The need to reduce costs and streamline operations at all stages of the supply chain is an established feature of modern business practice. This has been the reality for manufacturing firms in Ireland and elsewhere for some considerable time and has brought undoubted benefits to consumers in terms of lower prices for manufactured goods. Nevertheless, I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the possible implications for employment in Ireland particularly if changes in supply chain arrangements reduce the level of purchases by retailers from Irish producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Undoubtedly, the significant downturn in retail sales, as recorded in the Central Statistics Office's most recent bulletin, is putting pressure on all those involved in the retail sector, including retailers themselves and those who supply them, not least in the grocery goods sector. Whilst the reality is that most sectors of the economy are suffering as a result of the current downturn, its effects are more acute in sectors such as construction, the motor trade and the retail sector. Indeed the Quarterly National Household Survey published last month by the Central Statistics Office shows that the wholesale and retail trade as a whole suffered the second largest annual decrease in employment after the construction sector. Given these circumstances it is most important that the primary focus of all elements of the retail chain must be to secure existing jobs to ensure that Ireland continues to have a vibrant retail sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">In this regard, the Government fully appreciates the importance of successful food and retail sectors to the national economy. The Government acknowledges the need to ensure that there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector, which takes account of the interests of all the various parties, including the interests of consumers. My Department is currently working on the details of a Code of Practice in this area which will have as its key objective the need to achieve a balance in the relationships between grocery goods undertakings, taking into account the need to enhance consumer welfare and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">It is my intention to seek the views of all stakeholders in relation to the details of the provisions of the Code, which I hope to publish for public consultation in the coming weeks. The Code in setting out the framework in which the different elements of the retail chain can enter into negotiations and agree contractual arrangements between themselves will help to ensure that those arrangements are balanced and fair and ultimately ensure that interests of all parties, including consumers, are respected.</p>

The report identifies a number of areas where the proposed Directive might adversely affect Irish consumer rights and suggests ways in which these potential adverse effects can be ameliorated.  The Review Group's report is a substantial input into the Irish response to the proposed Directive and its contents have already been of significant benefit to the officials of my Department involved in discussions on the proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1468">These matters are being considered by me in the context of company law and by the Minister for Finance as part of his reform of the banking sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">The Company Law Consolidation and Reform Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It sets out the corporate duties of directors, company secretaries and auditors on a general basis across all sectors. The Bill will implement the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group in that the fiduciary duties owed by directors to the company will be stated in the new companies code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">At present company law does not prohibit cross directorships, whereby a person is a director of more than one company at the same time. The general position is that a person may not be a director of more than 25 companies subject to certain specific exceptions. Directorships of public limited companies (plcs) are not included in the limit of 25. Any consideration of a change in this position for the general cohort of companies operating in Ireland would need to take account of the contribution that non-executive directors make by imparting their mix of expertise and the cross fertilisation of ideas from other areas of the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">In relation to the issue of a chief executive becoming a chairman of the company, at present there is no prohibition in the Companies Acts that would prevent this taking place in the case of companies generally. However, this issue is dealt with on a "comply or explain" basis in the Combined Code of Corporate Governance that applies to companies whose securities are listed and traded on the Irish Stock Exchange. The "comply or explain " guideline requires companies to meet the best practice guidelines or explain publicly why not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The Government and I are committed to ensuring that our corporate governance regime for the corporate sector generally accords with best international practice. We will take account of the lessons which emerge from current enquiries and reviews arising from recent developments and we will address, as appropriate, any concerns in this area including by way of legislation if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1474">I am aware of the suggestions made in a number of quarters that a Code of Practice be introduced to regulate the relationships between the various elements in the retail chain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">These suggestions have arisen in the context of the wider debate in relation to prices and in particular the differential in prices between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">Since the publication of the Forfás report on the Cost of Running Retail Operations in Ireland in December 2008, the focus of the debate in relation to grocery prices and the differential in prices between here and Northern Ireland and the UK has shifted to issues in relation to the cost of sourcing products and distribution/supply arrangements attaching to the supply of products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Retailers have strongly contended that the cost of sourcing grocery goods products is much dearer in Ireland than the cost of sourcing such products in the UK and elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">On the other hand suppliers and distributors have contended that there is a significant imbalance in the relationship between retailers and suppliers, which is giving rise to suppliers being squeezed by the increasingly difficult demands being made by retailers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">It is disappointing that there should be such significant differences between the various elements within the retail chain as to the reasons for the current north south price differentials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">The Government, for its part, is concerned to ensure that we continue to have vibrant and successful food and retail sectors, given the important role these sectors play in the national economy. In this regard, the Government accepts the importance of ensuring that there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector, which takes account of the interests of all the various parties, including the interests of consumers. My Department, in cooperation with Minister Brendan Smith and Minister Trevor Sargent, is currently working on the details of a Code of Practice in this area which will have as its key objective the need to achieve a balance in the relationships between grocery goods undertakings, taking into account the need to enhance consumer welfare and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1483">The 2006 Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy sets out the economic rationale for North/South collaboration as well as making concrete proposals for economic initiatives. The case for an all island approach is made where market failure arises from the existence of the border or where public goods and services could be more efficiently produced on a co-ordinated basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">In the matter of enterprise, the Study identified a number of areas where co-ordinated policy intervention could prove beneficial including co-operation on trade and investment promotion, enhanced co-operation in support of enterprise and business development and improved regulatory environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">The clients of Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland are faced with similar challenges wherever their location on the island and, in many instances, both agencies offer largely parallel solutions to their clients where such an approach is appropriate. The Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are working together to ensure that the potential for development is exploited and that the challenges are met. In keeping with this goal, Enterprise Ireland's approach is to work in partnership with Invest NI and InterTradeIreland in an effort to maximise the benefits to all their clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">In so far as Enterprise Ireland is concerned, financial support is tailored to the requirements of individual companies (i.e. the business plan) on the basis of clearly demonstrated need and value for money. The funding EI provides is in the form of both direct grants to companies, and equity provision, typically depending on the stage of company development (i.e. early stage start-ups or established companies) in line with the risk profiles and development objectives involved. EI offers grant aid through two major funds, namely the Growth and R&amp;D Funds, along with a wide range of smaller grants available for exploring new opportunities. These supports target company development in areas such as management development and leadership, capital acquisition, research and development, market support, innovation and production capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">Furthermore, the State, through Enterprise Ireland has invested significant resources in developing the Seed and Venture Capital market in Ireland as a valuable source of capital for early and expansion stage companies, while also promoting other avenues of finance such as the Business Angel networks in conjunction with InterTradeIreland, and certifying client companies for Business Expansion Scheme investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Enterprise Ireland's grant aid offer must comply with the stipulations of the European Commission with regard to State Aid. Grants for industry are one instrument which can be used in order to develop enterprise and Enterprise Ireland's broad view is that the differential aid rates allowed in the BMW Region have been of benefit not solely with regard to the rate of start-ups but in terms of the development of existing companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">Non-financial supports are available for all EI supported projects. These include access to the Enterprise Ireland overseas office network for marketing/market research, technical/technology and training advice, knowledge events and seminars.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1498">Officials from this Department have engaged with their counterparts in other relevant Departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach, on the issue of Export Credit Insurance. In addition, the Tánaiste has discussed this matter with the Taoiseach and with her cabinet colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">The position on the possible introduction of a Scheme of State-backed Export Credit Insurance is that following analysis undertaken by Forfás at the Tánaiste's request and, following discussions with her Government colleagues, an accelerated tendering process has been initiated for the purposes of carrying out forensic due diligence on the credit insurance market in Ireland. The due diligence will include an in-depth examination of the client databases of the main credit insurance providers operating in Ireland and will assess the extent of market failure.  The level and nature of any such market failure will be quantified.  The due diligence will also assess the costs and impacts of possible intervention by the State in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">The initial phase of the accelerated tendering process, whereby expressions of interest were invited, has been finalised and completed tenders from the short- listed candidates, for the provision of the forensic examination of the Credit Insurance market have just been received. These tenders are being evaluated today and it is hoped to award a contract shortly.  It is intended that the analysis should be completed by early September next.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">At that stage, informed by this study, the Government will consider all the issues involved before making a decision on whether or not to progress the possible introduction of a State-backed top-up export credit insurance scheme.   Any such decision will need to consider issues such as default risk, exchequer exposure to costs, value for money, the impact of any such scheme on business and exports.   These factors will inform any future Government decision on whether to introduce a State-backed top-up export credit insurance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">Export Credit Insurance is just one of a range of measures that companies use as part of their financial model.  The Government has taken several initiatives to assist companies faced with credit difficulties.  As part of the banks' recapitalisation package, the Government decided to have an independent review of bank lending carried out in order to have an objective assessment of the current lending situation.  This process has just been completed and the results of this review will be available very shortly. In addition, the Government has established a Credit Supply Clearing Group with bank, business and State representation.  This Group, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for identifying possible credit supply solutions. In a further recent initiative, the Government has now introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments to their business suppliers, from 30 to 15 calendar days.</p>

            <p eId="para_1504">The total number of people on the Live Register for June 2009 was 418,600, an increase of over 90,700 since January of this year.  The most recent seasonally adjusted Live Register Standardised Unemployment Rate for June stands at 11.9%.  However, I would also point out that in the twelve-month period to the end of May 2009, 144,000 people left the Live Register as they had secured employment.  This is important as it shows that jobs are still being created.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">My Department records the number of redundancies notified to them on a monthly basis. From January to June 2009 the number of actual redundancies received under the Redundancy Scheme stands at 42,724.  Of these 29,385 were male and 13,339 were female.  Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey which is published by the Central Statistics Office.  In the first quarter of 2009, the most recent quarter for which data is available, there were 222,800 persons unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Employment data in respect of companies supported by the Enterprise Agencies (Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the County and City Enterprise Boards) is collated on an annual basis only, and accordingly monthly figures cannot be supplied.  The number of full-time jobs created in firms assisted by these Agencies in 2008 was about 21,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">The Enterprise Development agencies under the aegis of my Department are working closely in order to maintain an integrated approach to investment and enterprise development.  The strategies and policies being pursued by the State Development agencies will continue to support enterprise development and bring about job creation throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1514">The Work Placement Programme is being created in order to provide 2,000 six-month work experience places for graduates and other individuals.  The aim of this scheme is to provide invaluable work experience to individuals who are unemployed, who have recently graduated from college or have very limited experience of the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">To date the number of individuals who have expressed an interest with FÁS in the Programme and who meet the eligible criteria stands at 192. In terms of places, FÁS have received 180 enquiries to date from potential providers, which has resulted in 155 actual places being offered by providers. Considering that FÁS are in the process of finalising their targeted publicity campaign of the Programme, it is encouraging that they are experiencing a considerable level of interest from individuals and providers in the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">The Short Time Training Programme will provide training and income support to 277 workers currently on systematic short time working.

            <p eId="para_1517">FÁS are in the process of allocating the places on this Programme across a number of Regions using either their Local Employment Services office or their Local Services to Business Unit. To date approximately 120 places have been allocated across two FÁS Regions.

            <p eId="para_1519">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) currently has in place a team of 77 Inspectors.  Recruitment competitions were held to bring the number of Inspectors from the original level of 31 Inspectors up to the level of 90 committed to under <i>Towards 2016.</i>  60 inspectors were assigned to NERA from these competitions.  All NERA inspectors were recruited by way of competitive procedures, including internal competition within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, competition among staff of other Government Departments and a selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service to recruit ten inspectors with language skills.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1520">14 Inspectors have left NERA over the past year as a result of promotion or internal and external Departmental transfers and re-assignments.

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_459">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1524">My Department's continuous support for enterprises arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009 for the development agencies ensures that we can continue to build on this strategy for the future.  Irish exporters can avail of the support of these agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">In addition, the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund was established by Government to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies who are experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  €100m has been allocated to the fund to the end of 2010.  Client companies of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development across all sectors within manufacturing and internationally traded services are eligible to apply.  The fund is administered by Enterprise Ireland.   To date, approximately €26m of the 2009 allocation of €50m has been approved or is being processed. 16 projects have been approved support of approximately €6m and a further 30 projects are being processed.  In addition there are over 100 further enquiries that are live.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">A properly functioning banking sector is an essential element for the maintenance and development of enterprises, especially exporting enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">Government focus has been on creating a fit for purpose banking system as is evidenced by the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  Substantial guarantees and funding have been committed to the banking sector in order to keep the banks functioning to support the broader economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">A key principle of all these actions is the recognition of the importance of business lending. The Banks' Recapitalisation Package contains a range of initiatives to directly assist our enterprise sector, including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.  This should ensure that sound businesses will receive support from their banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">A €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds. Much of this funding will flow to small and medium enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">SMEs are also covered by the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  This Code which was published by the Financial Regulator came into effect from 13 March 2009.  The application of the Code will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">The recapitalised banks agreed to pay for and co-operate with the carrying out of an Independent Review of Bank Lending to SMEs.  Additional banks have now participated in this Review with the result that the 5 major lending banks are now included. The purpose of the review is to ascertain the position on credit availability to SMEs here and to recommend appropriate action to improve credit availability. The Independent Review has now been submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and will be published immediately.  This Review should allow all stakeholders have an objective view of the state of lending from the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will also provide funding for SMEs on foot of €300m facilities provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">Arising from the Recapitalisation Package, the Tánaiste has, along with the Minister for Finance, also established a Credit Supply Clearing Group with bank, business (including ISME and SFA) and State representation.  This Group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.  The Group is however, not an appeals mechanism for cases where credit has been refused by the banks. Individual business decisions remain the responsibility of the banks. The Credit Supply Clearing Group is being chaired by my Department and will work to provide a clear picture of any emerging lending patterns while facilitating direct discussion by all the relevant interests in addressing problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">To assist and complement the work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, I personally have held seven regional meetings beginning in Cork on Monday 29 June to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the state sector, their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level. Meetings to date were held in Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Bundoran, Shannon, Galway and Athlone. The last meeting will be held in Dundalk on Monday next 13 July. The outcome of theses meetings should facilitate a greater understanding of the issue at both regional and national levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">Government has also introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments to their business suppliers from 30 to 15 calendar days. This commitment has effect on all valid invoices received on and from 15 June 2009 and should help ease cash flow difficulties for enterprises.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1542">I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 59, 91, 129 and 135 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">A number of recent reports have referred to the need to restore competitiveness and in particular cost competitiveness.  These include the IMF, OECD, the National Competitiveness Council and the Competition Authority.  One of the immediate policy objectives with regard to competitiveness is to restore our cost competitiveness. This is a key action set out in the Framework for Economic Renewal.   We are aware that strong domestic demand in recent years led to significant increases in the costs of doing business in Ireland. However, the economy is now undergoing a radical adjustment which can lead to the necessary change required to restore external competitiveness.  As part of this process there are a number of factors which can influence our cost base.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">Firstly, Irish inflation declined by 4.7 percent in the year to May 2009, the sharpest fall since 1933. Inflation fell significantly across most goods and services groups in 2009.  Secondly, the Government have stepped in to exert downward pressure on prices and costs.  Although it has been a painful adjustment, the reduction in unit labour costs delivered through public pay reform will strengthen our longer term competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">For most exporting firms, labour costs<b> </b>account<b> </b>for over half of their input costs. While Irish wage levels are moderate when compared to other high income economies, wage inflation in Ireland has been running at up to 50 percent higher than the eurozone average during the 2005-2008 period. More recently, nominal wage growth has slowed and is likely to fall in 2009. The EU estimates that Irish unit labour costs will fall by 4% this year, compared with a 3% increase in the EU on average, translating into a significant improvement in competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">Thirdly, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Economic Renewal, we will implement the recommendations of the Competition Authority and tackle excessive costs in the non-traded sectors where they can best contribute to overall competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">Fourthly, we are working to bring costs in administered sectors of the economy under control such as local authority charges and also easing the administrative burden that regulations can create.  Minister Gormley and I have met with the County Managers regarding actions that local authorities can take to ease cost pressures on business and we plan to meet with them again shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Across Government there is a concerted approach to eliminate structural rigidities that have contributed to high costs.  The current initiative to legislate against upward only rent reviews is a further example of this cross Government effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">Finally, with regard to energy costs for businesses, in recent months, the trend of energy prices has been downward with a 10% drop in electricity prices for residents and Small and Medium Enterprises from 1 May, while gas prices have reduced by an average of 12%.  These reductions will result in a further easing of cost pressures for businesses.  I will continue to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure that we continue to exert downward pressure on energy costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1556">On 1 January 2006 responsibility for the Social Economy Programme transferred to the Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs and it has been re-named as the Community Services Programme.  FÁS as an agency of my Department operates Job Initiative (JI).</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">The Job Initiative Programme (JI) was launched in July 1996 and provides full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities. The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by Minister Micheál Martin no new entrants have been admitted onto the Job Initiative Schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed and CE participants to support the service being provided may replace those who leave voluntarily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">This Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS Employment Schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.   The operation of the Scheme is being kept under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1576">The Short-Time Training Programme is a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This Programme, which will cost €1 million, will provide 277 individuals who are working a 3-day week and are receiving social welfare payments for the other 2 days, with training for these 2 days for a period of 52 weeks. In order to qualify participants must be on systematic short time working.</p>

            <p eId="para_1581">There are currently a total of 10 EU Directives due to be transposed by my Department up to 2012.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1586">A properly functioning banking sector is an essential element for the maintenance and development of enterprises, especially SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">Government focus has been on creating a fit for purpose banking system as is evidenced by the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  Substantial guarantees and funding have been committed to the banking sector in order to keep the banks functioning to support the broader economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">A key principle of all these actions is the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly in relation to SMEs.  SMEs are central to our economy and the provision of bank credit to the sector is a primary target of all these initiatives.  The Banks' Recapitalisation Package contains a range of initiatives to directly assist our enterprise sector, including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.  This should ensure that sound businesses will receive support from their banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">A €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds. Much of this funding will flow to small and medium enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">SMEs are also covered by the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  This Code which was published by the Financial Regulator came into effect from 13 March 2009.  The application of the Code will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">The recapitalised banks agreed to pay for and co-operate with the carrying out of an Independent Review of Bank Lending to SMEs.  Additional banks have now participated in this Review with the result that the 5 major lending banks are now included. The purpose of the review is to ascertain the position on credit availability to SMEs here and to recommend appropriate action to improve credit availability. The Independent Review has now been submitted to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and will be published immediately.  I welcome the completion of this Review as it should allow all stakeholders have an objective view of the state of lending from the banks to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will also provide funding for SMEs on foot of €300m facilities provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">Arising from the Recapitalisation Package, the Tánaiste has, along with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, also established a Credit Supply Clearing Group with bank, business (including ISME and SFA) and State representation.  This Group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.  The Group is however, not an appeals mechanism for cases where credit has been refused by the banks. Individual business decisions remain the responsibility of the banks. The Credit Supply Clearing Group is being chaired by my Department and will work to provide a clear picture of any emerging lending patterns while facilitating direct discussion by all the relevant interests in addressing problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">The Group met for the first time on 28 May 2009 and will meet again shortly following the publication of the Independent Review of Bank Credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">To assist and complement the work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group, I personally have held seven regional meetings beginning in Cork on Monday 29 June to discuss with representatives of business, banks and the state sector, their experience of gaining access to bank credit at local and regional level. I have to date, held meetings in Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Bundoran, Shannon, Galway and Athlone. The last meeting will be held in Dundalk on Monday next 13 July. In the course of these meetings, I met with local representatives of the major banks, business representatives from local Chambers of Commerce, ISME, SFA, IFA and the Irish Hotels Federation. Local representatives from the various State Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, City and County Enterprise Boards and Fáilte Ireland, also attended.  The outcome of theses meetings should facilitate a greater understanding of the issue at both regional and national levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">Outside of the banking sphere, my Department's continuous support for enterprises arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009 for the development agencies ensures that we can continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">Government has also introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments to their business suppliers from 30 to 15 calendar days. This commitment has effect on all valid invoices received on and from 15 June 2009 and should help ease cash flow difficulties for SMEs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1604">The co-operative movement has made a huge contribution to economic and social development in Ireland over many years.  We have only to think of agricultural co-ops, credit unions and other sectors such as social housing, group water schemes and community development in which the co-op model has been used with great success.  A very good description and analysis of the co-operative sector was provided by the Forfás study "Ireland's Co-operative Sector" commissioned by my Department and which was published in November 2007.  (available at www.forfas.ie/media/cooperative_sector_2007.pdf)</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">Most co-operatives in Ireland, particularly those which undertake economic or business activities, register as "industrial and provident societies" under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, the principal Act being that of 1893.  While this legislation has served us well over the years, it is time to carry out a comprehensive and full review of the current arrangements and this is now under way.  Credit Unions, since 1997, have their own modern legislation, separate from the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">The initial focus of the current review is on identifying any practical difficulties or problems for co-operatives in the existing legislation.  To assist in this work, we published in April 2009 a consultation paper on the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893 — 2005 and invited views and observations from interested members of the public.  I am glad to say that we have had a good response to this paper.  I would also encourage any interested parties who have not yet submitted views or observations to do so as soon as possible.  Copies of the consultation paper are available in the Oireachtas library and also on my Department's website (www.entemp.ie/commerce/cooplaw).</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">On completion of the consultation process, I intend to bring appropriate policy recommendations to the Government.  These will address the question of whether, in the light of the public consultation, there is a need for change in the current legislation and, if so, the general lines such change might take.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that the primary objective of the current review and of any legislative initiatives resulting from it will be to ensure and provide a regulatory environment that is supportive of the co-operative movement and of its capacity to contribute to economic and social well being into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1611">There have been 18 workplace deaths reported to the Authority to date in 2009 (as at 02.07.09). The numbers of workplace deaths reported to the Authority for the years 2002-2008 are as follows: 57 in 2008; 67 in 2007; 51 in 2006; 74 in 2005; 50 in 2004; 68 in 2003 and 61 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">Non-fatal accidents, resulting in an absence of more than three days from normal work following the accident, are required to be reported to the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">There have been 3,147 non-fatal work related accidents reported to the Authority to date in 2009 (as at 02.07.09). There were 6,998 in 2008, 7,816 in 2007, 7,844 in 2006, 8,104 in 2005, 8,453 in 2004, 6,622 in 2003, and 7,746 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">While the reduction in workplace fatalities since 2007 is welcome, we still had 57 fatalities and thousands of workplace injuries in 2008, many of them preventable. We cannot afford to relax our vigilance in this area. In these times when we are tempted to look at costs, we have to continually emphasise the message that keeping people safe and healthy at work and saving money are not mutually exclusive concepts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">The Health and Safety Authority's 2009 Programme of Work, which was launched in February last, sets out a comprehensive range of activities to make workplaces safer and it contains a good balance between prevention, advice and enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">This year the Authority is again focusing on the high-risk sectors of agriculture and construction, which have seen the highest proportions of fatalities in the last four years — in 2008, 21 fatalities occurred in Agriculture and 15 in Construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">Day to day responsibility for workplace safety rests with those in the workplace — employers and employees and safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who control and work in them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">The Health and Safety Authority publishes guidelines, codes of practice and other advice on safety on a regular basis as well as organising sectoral seminars or conferences to promote the occupational safety and health message, as part of its advocacy role. These activities, together with the information on the Authority's website, are of critical importance to all those in the workplace if Ireland's safety record is to be improved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1620">I am aware of the announcement of the job losses.  A global review of the organisation in question has been in place since February of this year with a view to reducing costs and numbers employed worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">While the news of the job losses is very disappointing, Enterprise Ireland continues to work extensively with the company in Dublin on the implementation of Research and Development projects which are proceeding as planned.  Over the next three years, Diageo will invest €24m in expanding its R&amp;D activity across an extensive range of innovative project areas.  This investment will be underpinned by a management development initiative to lead the development of the R&amp;D Centre and drive the delivery of the new projects.  These R&amp;D projects are expected to contribute to increasing annual sales by €250m over three years with a significant percentage of this coming from export sales, making a major contribution to growing exports from the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">The Enterprise Development agencies adopt a co-ordinated response to deal with such situations.  The agencies work together in making employees aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment or start their own businesses.

            <p eId="para_1624">I am very much aware that the key to creating employment is to provide the necessary support to the enterprise sector.  In this regard, the Government made provision in the recent Supplementary Budget for in excess of €500 million for capital investment in enterprise.  In doing so, the Government has prioritised investment in the most productive sectors of our economy and is investing in the creation of jobs by cementing the foundations of export led recovery and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">The Enterprise Development agencies under the aegis of my Department are working together and with local interests in order to maintain an integrated approach to investment and enterprise development.  The strategies and policies being pursued by the Enterprise Development agencies will continue to support enterprise development and bring about job creation and retention throughout the country.  I recently announced the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which will enable internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets. Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">Enterprise Ireland, in recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that will be undertaken to help clients in 2009. Enterprise Ireland has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of its client base.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">The focus of IDA Ireland is on securing inward investment from new and existing clients and on working with its existing client base to further embed their investments in Ireland.  It has an active programme of engagement with its clients to target new investment opportunities from them.  The agency assists its client companies to move up the value chain in terms of both carrying out higher skilled operations and expanding their presence in Ireland.  These activities are aimed at improving the quality of employment opportunities and retaining existing jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">The County and City Enterprise Boards were established to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level, primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro enterprises. The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business, continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development regionally and nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">A properly functioning banking sector is an essential element for the maintenance and development of enterprises, especially Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs).</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">Government focus has been on creating a fit for purpose banking system as is evidenced by the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  Substantial guarantees and funding have been committed to the banking sector in order to keep the banks functioning to support the broader economy. A key principle of all these actions is the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly in relation to SMEs.  The SMEs are central to our economy and the provision of bank credit to the sector is a primary target of all these initiatives.  The Banks' Recapitalisation Package contains a range of initiatives to directly assist our enterprise sector.</p>

This means that even in the most difficult period in terms of employment creation, jobs are still being created in our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">According to the FÁS paper <i>Job Opportunities in the Downturn</i>, and the more recent <i>National Skills Bulletin</i> by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs a number of areas are currently showing demand for labour, these include:</p>

            <p eId="para_1643">The activation places that are available in both the education and training sectors are aimed at providing individuals with the skills so they can secure employment in areas that will be in demand. For instance my Department is currently providing through FÁS in excess of 129,000 training places for the unemployed. The majority of this provision, 92,000 are being provided under FÁS Training Initiatives Strategy and are short courses in specific skills training. These courses are designed to develop new skills and competencies for the unemployed to assist them in securing employment in specific sectors, where employment opportunities exist.</p>

            <p eId="para_1646">The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland. They provide support to businesses with 10 or less employees in the start-up and expansion phases, promote indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  As locally based enterprise development agencies the Boards are well positioned to meet the needs of their local economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">I have secured a Capital Allocation for the CEBs of over €20m for provision of both financial and non-financial supports to the micro-enterprise sector in 2009.

            <p eId="para_1660">The only area where predictions can be made relate to those staff who will retire in accordance with the compulsory retirement scheme.  Since 27 March 2009 ten staff members have retired from the Department with a further two compulsory retirements to take place before the end of 2009.  Consequential vacancies will not be filled. Additional vacancies will be created as a result of the following incentives introduced by the Minister for Finance in recent months:</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (Circular 12/09), whereby employees of 50 years of age and over who have already accrued entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits under a public service scheme, and who have not yet reached normal preserved pension age can apply for early retirement. The Scheme is open to applications from 1 May 2009 until 1 September 2009 after which the scheme will be reviewed in the context of Budget 2010.

            <p eId="para_1687">I am aware of the job losses at the company in its plants at Coolock and Rathmore.  The company is a client of Enterprise Ireland and the agency has been maintaining close contact with the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">There have been large scale voluntary redundancies at the company in recent years.  While significant progress was made over the last two to three years, the Irish operations continue to be under pressure. It was clear that further redundancies were necessary from the company's point of view.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">While the news that 170 jobs in Coolock and 30 jobs in Rathmore will be lost is extremely disappointing, I am encouraged by the plans that the company has for a large scale investment in new moulded equipment and technology.  The agency has provided significant support to the company's operations in relation to capital, human resource development and research and development over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">The Enterprise Development agencies adopt a co-ordinated response to deal with such situations.  The agencies work together in making employees aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment or start their own businesses.  The agencies will also work to attract new investment and jobs to the areas.  However, the final decision as to where projects locate rests with the promoters of the particular projects.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1692">The joint investigation teams between the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have been operational since 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">The Social Partnership Agreement ‘Towards 2016', provided for greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area. In particular, the Agreement provides that authorised officers of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will join with officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units. The role of these Joint Investigation Units, or JIUs, is to address areas where evidence suggests that non-compliance with employment rights legislation exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, which came into operation on 30 March 2007, provides for the disclosure of relevant employment data between the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment/NERA. This legislation effectively enables NERA to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">Since the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, exchange of information activity has taken place between the bodies in a number of specific cases. In addition, JIUs, involving NERA with Revenue and/or Social and Family Affairs have also taken place.  In 2007, joint investigation activity, involving NERA for the first time, took place during the Construction Industry Campaign in May-July 2007.  In 2008, joint investigation activity has been undertaken in a number of sectors including the catering, the hotel and the haulage sector. In 2009, joint investigation activity has continued both through exchange of information and through joint inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">The three bodies are proactively promoting and encouraging joint activity at a central and local level.   I understand that a series of regional meetings were held late last year involving the relevant inspectors in those regions.  These meetings have ensured that all officers understand their respective roles and potential synergies arising from working together within the parameters set out in the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">I believe that the effective operation of JIUs provides a key opportunity for us to maximise the work of the three inspectorates.  This has been proven in the past with JIU operations between Revenue and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. NERA's experience to date of JIU activity, both exchange of information and joint inspections, has been very positive and has added greatly to their ability to provide an effective inspection service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">In relation to the number of inspectors, NERA currently has in place a team of 77 inspectors.  Recruitment competitions have been held to bring the number of inspectors from the original level of 31 inspectors up to the level of 90 committed to under <i>Towards 2016.</i>  Sixty inspectors were assigned to NERA from these competitions. Fourteen inspectors have left NERA over the past year as a result of promotion or internal and external Departmental transfers and re-assignments.  As a result, the total number of NERA inspectors currently stands at seventy seven.  One of the seventy seven inspectors is currently not actively performing inspections due to maternity leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">The Minister for Finance recently introduced a moratorium on the filling of vacancies until the end of 2010, in light of which NERA will not be in a position to fill current and future inspector vacancies during that timeframe.</p>

            <p eId="para_1705">During the course of Social Partnership talks in 2008, the Government committed itself to introducing legislation amending Section 4 of the Companies Act 2002 to the effect that certain categories of vulnerable workers, formerly or currently covered by collective agreements, when engaging in collective bargaining, would be excluded from the Section 4 prohibition.  The commitment will take into account that there would be negligible negative impacts on the economy or on the level of competition and will have regard to the specific attributes and nature of the work involved, subject to consistency with EU competition rules.  It is proposed that three specific categories of worker, namely voice-over actors, freelance journalists and session musicians will be covered by the exclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1709">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">The publication last week of the study by the Competition Authority of the retail-related import and distribution sector is part of my own and the Government's ongoing commitment to bring greater transparency to structure and pricing in the retail sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">I asked the Competition Authority to carry out the study following the findings of a Forfás report, which suggested that the strong Euro, which had failed to translate into lower import costs on goods from the United Kingdom, could be indicative of a lack of competition in the import, distribution and retail sectors. This study will, I believe, greatly assist in informing the wider debate on why Irish consumers have not seen the full benefits of the strengthening Euro against Sterling over the past year in the prices they were paying for certain goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">Overall, this study confirms that while there are no major systemic problems in the overall retail market, the market dynamics can differ across the various retail sectors with some being more flexible than others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The study also shows that price adjustment to currency movements varies across sectors while also providing evidence which suggests that the ‘high low' pricing policy that operates in this country, while less transparent than the everyday low prices policy that operates in the UK and Northern Ireland, is in fact a function of what the Irish consumer had grown to know.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">However, it is now clear that demand for the ‘high low' policy is changing and that Irish consumers now want everyday lower prices.  This is evidenced by the success of new entrants to the market, by consumers travelling to shop in other markets and by more recent changes in certain supply, distribution and pricing structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">The report also finds that increasingly price-conscious consumers are shopping around for the best prices, which in turn spurs more competition between retailers and their suppliers.  This is causing prices to fall.  For example, between January and May 2009 grocery prices fell by over 2% with additional grocery price reductions signalled this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Reductions in the cost of goods cannot be viewed in isolation however. Continued focus on reducing the cost of doing business in this country is necessary in order to help suppliers increase and maintain their competitiveness. The development of any policy affecting the grocery goods sector must reflect the importance of the indigenous food industry and of the retail sector, both of which must be vibrant and competitive while also best serving the consumer and their welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">As regards future steps, I can confirm that work is ongoing in my Department on the drafting of a Code of Practice for the grocery sector that would aim to bring further transparency and ensure a balanced relationship between all elements of that retail chain, including retailers, suppliers, distributors and consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">The study has been brought to the attention of the European Commission and also to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment in order to assist with their respective retail sector examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">I have also arranged for copies of the report to be distributed to all Deputies in the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1721">Directive 2008/104/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Temporary Agency Work was adopted, on 19 November 2008.  Under the terms of this directive there is a three-year period within which Member States will be required to transpose the Directive into national legislation i.e. by 5 December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">Some months ago, I invited the Social Partners to discussions with my Department, with the aim of agreeing a framework within which agency workers in Ireland would achieve equal treatment within an agreed timeframe having regard also to the need for flexibility in enterprises.  The Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 concluded by the Social Partners and the Government contains a commitment to developing such a framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">My Department has already facilitated an initial meeting between the Social Partners to help them to develop a national framework within the parameters established in the EU Directive.  The successful conclusion of a Framework Agreement will enable the Government to consider transposing the terms of the Directive, including the terms of the Framework Agreement, at a date in advance of the maximum period allowed under the Directive i.e. end 2011.</p>

The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund will enable internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets. Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.

            <p eId="para_1737">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has carried out a total of 10,445 calls, visits and inspections up to 26 June 2009.

This increased level of inspection activity in 2008 and 2009 is reflective of the greater level of inspection resources available to NERA, from the original level of 31 inspectors in 2007 to a current complement of 77 NERA inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Since it commenced operations on an interim basis in 2007, NERA has had considerable success in raising awareness of employment rights.  Early in 2008, NERA undertook a nationwide information and awareness campaign, which has been instrumental in bringing about a much greater level of awareness both by employers and by employees of their respective rights and obligations under employment law.  The information role has been enhanced through the inspection process.  This information and awareness role continues to play a significant part in NERA's employment rights compliance and information strategy.</p>

This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year.  This has been achieved by redeploying significant resources towards activating the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">Included in these places are specific new measures such as a work placement programme, which is providing 2,000 six-month places to individuals who are unemployed and includes the placement of graduates.  A new training programme of 277 places at a cost of €1 million is being introduced.  Under this programme 277 workers who are on a three-day week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working will receive 2 days training a week for a period of 52 weeks.  Also 2,500 places are being provided for those who are unemployed to participate in part-time third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">The Government is also assisting redundant apprentices complete their apprenticeships through a number of special measures which will result in over 3600 redundant apprentices being able to progress their training this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">The Government recently presented proposals to the Social Partners which focused on measures to prevent job losses including the possible introduction of a temporary employment subsidy scheme which aims to helps employees retain their jobs and employers their skilled workforce in these difficult times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">While activation measures will assist individuals in securing employment and enhancing their skills, the key to addressing our unemployment problem is the creation of more jobs.  Enterprise Ireland has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base which includes the management of the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which provides €100 million to assist viable but vulnerable companies overcome the present economic difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">The key to IDA Ireland's strategy is to progress the development of a knowledge based economy so that the county can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  IDA has an active programme of engagement with its clients to identify and target new investment opportunities.   The aim of this is to retain existing clients, improve the quality of employment opportunities in Ireland and increase the positive economic impact.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1750">Based on an analysis of the figures contained in the National Census 2006 carried out by the National Disability Authority, the total number of people with disabilities in the 20 — 64 years age group who were in employment was 72,889, representing an employment rate of 35.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">The Government is committed to increasing the overall employment participation of people with disabilities in the open labour market.  The immediate objective under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, and the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, is to have an additional 7,000 people with disabilities who do not have a difficulty in retaining a job in employment by 2010.  The longer term target under the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 is to increase the employment rate of people with disabilities from 37% to 45% by 2016, as measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">In the period 2006-2008 a total of 5,210 people with disabilities have been placed in jobs from the various FÁS programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">The Sectoral Plan of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment includes as a key commitment the development of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  The Department has led on the advancement of such a strategy in discussions with other relevant Government Departments, and with key stakeholder representatives who form the Consultative Forum on an Employment Strategy established under the Department's Sectoral Plan.  The aim of this strategy is to address the diversity of circumstances, needs and abilities of people with disabilities, and to work towards achieving the highest possible levels of employment for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">Discussions on the further development and finalisation of the comprehensive employment strategy are being actively pursued with the Consultative Forum and inter-departmental groups with a view to completing the strategy as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1757">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 114 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">This year the Government has almost doubled the number of FÁS activation training and work experience places for the unemployed to over 129,000.  This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year.  The majority of these additional places are on short courses and will be delivered through three core-training initiatives, Short Courses, Night Courses and Online Courses.  These courses are designed to develop new skills and competencies for the unemployed to assist them in securing employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">Other new programmes which have been rolled out for the unemployed are the Work Placement Programme and the Short time Training Programme.  The Work Placement Programme is a six-month work experience programme for 2,000 individuals who are currently unemployed. Under this programme individuals will retain their social welfare entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The Short Time Working Training Programme<b> </b>will provide two days training a week for 277 workers over a 52-week period who are on systematic short time.  Participants on this programme will also continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements.  Information on the range of training programmes offered by FÁS for the unemployed is provided in tabular format.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">In terms of the allocation of training places each of the 8 FÁS Regions in consultation with the relevant regional stakeholders — develop appropriate plans regarding the range, mix and type of training courses appropriate to the needs of that region.  In this process each region will identify its training needs based on regional profiles, which include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">Response to the live-register activity of the region</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">The demand for specific training courses from jobseeker's living in the region</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">Response to regional redundancy situations</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">The skills required by local enterprises to sustain businesses</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">Current or future (short — longer term) labour market needs of the region</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">Regional variations in the type and level of training provided to meet the above will exist across regions.  Budgets for training courses are allocated across regions based on the above factors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1822">Responsibility for implementing the terms of the Government Decision relating to the payment by Central Departments of business suppliers within 15 days rests with each individual Department.  Suppliers experiencing difficulties with payments should contact the relevant Departmental section with which the contract was arranged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">The Secretary General of my Department wrote to all Government Departments on 26 May, asking them to take the necessary steps to implement this commitment and to ensure that Department line staff and Finance Units are made aware of the need to prioritise payments to suppliers to meet the 15 day deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The Government Decision of 19 May included a requirement for Departments to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting these requirements.  These reports are to be submitted by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter and the first such report will now be due by 15 October 2009.  Departments are also required to include information on the implementation of the measures in their subsequent Annual Reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">In addition to the commitment for Departments, the Government also stated that an assessment would be completed of the impact of extending this requirement to the local authority, health and education sectors.  This assessment is currently under way.  Specific proposals in relation to these sectors will be developed following the completion of the assessment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1827">In response to the rising numbers of unemployed, the Government has formulated and implemented a realistic and practical strategy to prioritise the activation and training of such individuals.  My Department, along with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science, have been working closely together to ensure a significant response to the unemployment situation.  The Work Placement Programme and the Short Time Working Training Programme, which were announced in the Supplementary Budget, are but two initiatives that have been created to contribute to the challenge of activating and training the unemployed. It should be noted that these Programmes form only an element of the Government's response to the unemployment challenge, which also includes a substantial increase in job search, training and education supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">The Work Placement Programme has been created to provide 2,000 six-month work experience places for graduates and other individuals.  The aim of this scheme is to provide invaluable work experience to individuals who are unemployed, who have recently graduated from college or have very limited experience of the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">To date the number of individuals who have expressed an interest with FÁS in the Programme and who meet the eligible criteria stands at 192.  In terms of places, FÁS has received 180 enquiries to date from potential providers, which has resulted in 155 actual places being offered by providers.  Considering that FÁS is in the process of finalising its targeted publicity campaign of the Programme, it is encouraging that it is experiencing a considerable level of interest from individuals and providers in the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">The Short Time Training Programme will provide training and income support to 277 workers currently on systematic short time working.  Under this Programme workers who are on a three-day week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working will receive 2 days training a week for a period of 52 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">FÁS is in the process of allocating the places on this Programme across a number of regions using either their Local Employment Services office or their Local Services to Business Unit.  To date approximately 120 places have been allocated across two FÁS regions.  FÁS is continuing to explore a number of other possible enquiries from other FÁS regions in relation to the allocation of the remaining places.  It is intended that these places will be allocated in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Finally, it is my intention to review the effectiveness and impact of the Programmes upon the satisfactory completion of their roll-out.  It will be in this context that any potential changes, such as changes to the eligibility and scale of these Programmes will be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1834">I am very much aware that the key to creating employment is to provide the necessary support to the enterprise sector.  In this regard, the Government made provision in the recent Supplementary Budget for in excess of €500 million for capital investment in enterprise.  In doing so, the Government has prioritised investment in the most productive sectors of our economy and is investing in the creation of jobs by cementing the foundations of export led recovery and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">The main focus of IDA Ireland on securing inward investment is from new and existing clients in the areas of high-end manufacturing, global services, research and development and innovation.  The agency is working with its existing client base to further embed their investments in Ireland.  It has an active programme of engagement with its clients to identify and target new investment opportunities from them.  The agency continues to assist its client companies to move up the value chain in terms of both carrying out higher skilled operations and expanding their presence in Ireland.  These activities are aimed at improving the quality of employment opportunities in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">Enterprise Ireland has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that will be undertaken to help clients in 2009.  The agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of its client base.  In identifying the short term issues, the agency has developed a series of proposals which deal with access to finance, winning new sales, encouraging competitiveness, continuous innovation/research and development and development of entrepreneurship.  The medium term focus of the revised strategy is to continue to drive a sound, sustainable, competitive export-oriented indigenous sector.  I also recently announced the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which will enable internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets.  Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">The County and City Enterprise Boards provide support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases.  The CEBs promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level, with priority being given to manufacturing and internationally traded services.  The boards recognise that business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in their activities. They deliver a series of programmes to underpin this role and can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1839">It is crucial that with the increasing numbers of people who are now unemployed that we seek to further enhance the activation and training opportunities to assist these individuals.  It is vital that we ensure jobseeker's are supported, and have access to appropriate and relevant guidance, education and training services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">Specifically in relation to responding to the significant numbers of people who have been made redundant from the construction sector, the Government is committed to providing assistance to these workers.  We will achieve this through increasing their skills levels and, in some cases, helping them develop new skills sets that will allow them take advantage of opportunities in new emerging growth areas within the construction sector.  These include the installation of energy efficient and renewable technologies, together with compliance and energy rating work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">At present FÁS offer courses in Gas Safety and Gas Installation; Sustainable Energy equipment installation; Building Energy Ratings; Smart/Intelligent Buildings design; Insulation Technologies and Techniques, with a total of over 3,000 training places available in these disciplines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">Plans are well advanced for the provision of additional courses that are due to come on stream later this year: Micro-Electricity Generation Wind Turbine and Photovoltaic Courses and Passive House Building.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">In addition to these type of courses unemployed individuals from the construction sector can access the other FÁS training courses, in order to develop new skills.  Since the end of last year this Government has almost doubled the number of my Department's activation training and work experience places to 129,000 from the 66,000 that were provided last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">The majority of these additional places, 92,000 are being provided under FÁS Training Initiatives Strategy and are short courses in specific skills training. These courses are designed to develop new skills and competencies for the unemployed to assist them in securing employment.  FÁS is providing such courses for a broad range of different sectors including the retail, IT, construction, manufacturing and services sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">These training courses represent a substantive commitment on the part of this Government to assist those affected by the current downturn in the construction sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1847">Table 1 sets out the number of statutory redundancies for years 2002 to 2008 and provisional figures for January to June 2009.  These figures reflect the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.  It is not possible to project the number of redundancies which will accrue in 2009 as this will depend on a number of factors, including economic indicators, and the rate of recovery in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">Table 2 sets out the moneys paid out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2002-2008 up to and including the end of June, 2009.  It should be noted that the figures provided for 2008 and to date in 2009 are provisional figures.  Equally, it is not possible to project the amounts which will be paid out in 2009 given that this will hinge on a number of variables including the number of claims received, the length of service of the claimants etc.</p>

         if her attention has been drawn to the announcement of the loss of 177 jobs at a company (details supplied) in County Waterford; the discussions she has had with the industrial development agencies with a view to securing replacement jobs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_494">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1917">On 25 June 2009 ABB advised IDA that it has decided to close their electrical transformer manufacturing operation in Waterford with the loss of all 185 jobs.  Closure will take place by March 2010.  The plant has sufficient contracts in place to ensure that the factory remains open until March 2010.  The Waterford operation has been operating at break-even and an expected upturn in business from growth in wind generation has not materialised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Key to IDA Ireland's Strategy for County Waterford within the South East Region is to progress the development of a knowledge based economy so that the county and particularly the Gateway of Waterford City can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment. IDA Strategy for County Waterford includes:</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">The provision of world class property solutions of scale in the Waterford City area and also developing property solutions in the county town of Dungarvan, with appropriate supporting infrastructure in both cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">Working with local development partner agencies in Waterford City and County to advance critical infrastructure, both hard and soft, which will contribute to a sustainable business environment for the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">IDA Ireland is also actively engaged with the existing IDA client base in the City and County to encourage their transition to continually higher value activities and to promote further investment in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">Waterford has a long and strong track record as a centre of manufacturing expertise.  Waterford has a key strength in engineering, in both indigenous and overseas sectors.  In more recent years however, these have been giving way to newer, more advanced manufacturing, particularly in the Life Sciences sector and also to International &amp; Financial Services activities.  For companies in lower value manufacturing, the business environment has become more challenging in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">Currently there are 31 IDA Ireland supported companies in Waterford City and County employing approximately 5,960 people.  Clear evidence of a transition to more knowledge based and higher value activity is seen in the resilience of companies such as Bausch &amp; Lomb, Teva, Honeywell, GlaxoSmithKline, as well as newer additions to the county's portfolio, such as Citi Hedge Fund Services, Genzyme and Sun Life Financial.  In marketing Waterford for new foreign direct investment (FDI), IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge-based industries, including advanced manufacturing.  Sectors of focus in the medium term are Life Sciences, International and Financial Services and High Technology Engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">Key interventions in support of the above efforts in recent years have been the development of the Waterford Business &amp; Technology Park (28 hectares), the Dungarvan Business Park (additional 14 hectares developed) and a large scale 55 hectare Greenfield site in Belview.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">IDA Ireland recognises that Waterford City has some way to go before it has developed the critical mass of infrastructure, population and economic development to assert itself as a true regional gateway.  Key positive developments that have occurred or are about to take place that will enhance Waterford's attractiveness for FDI and greatly encourage Waterford's economic success and national profile into the future include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">The completion of the outer ring road in Waterford City has already eased local traffic congestion and improvements on all radial routes into the City are also progressing well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">Construction of the Waterford City By-pass including a new cable stay bridge is under way and is due for completion in Q4 2009.  The N9 upgrade to high specification dual carriageway between Waterford and Dublin has also commenced and is targeted for completion by 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">Major commercial/retail developments in Waterford City such as the Railway Square development and the planned development by KRM of a large scale shopping facility, Hotel and Conference Centre, apartments and car-parking on a 5 acre site in the City Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">The City Council is investing €20m on the development of a Historic Quarter in the City Centre including the redevelopment of the Theatre Royal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">High profile national and local events such as the Tall Ships Race 2005 and the Spraoi Street Festival.  The Tall Ships Race is due to be staged in Waterford for a second time in 2011 and this will bring a lot of additional visitors to Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_1931">Further development of WIT, particularly the development of the new Campus at Carriganore with its flagship project being the Arc Labs facility which houses the Telecoms Software and Systems Group, itself a key magnet of attraction for Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">Recent completion of the Metropolitan Area Networks in Waterford City and Dungarvan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">Developments at Waterford Port — a 190 metre quay extension has been constructed involving investment of €10m by the Port of Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">These and other developments will provide a critical mix that will be a vital stimulus for further investment and economic development in Waterford City and the wider county including Dungarvan.</p>

            <p eId="para_1939">I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 134 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">Issues in relation to the strategies employed by businesses, including in the area of sourcing supplies, are primarily matters for the businesses themselves. The need to reduce costs and streamline operations at all stages of the supply chain is particularly more pressing in these difficult economic times. Nevertheless, I do appreciate the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the possible implications for employment in Ireland particularly if changes in supply chain arrangements reduce the level of purchases by retailers from Irish producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">In this regard, the Government is anxious to ensure that we continue to have vibrant and successful food and retail sectors, given the important role these sectors play in the national economy.  The Government accepts the importance of ensuring that there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector, which takes account of the interests of all the various parties, including the interests of consumers.  My Department is currently working on the details of a Code of Practice in this area which will have as its key objective the need to achieve a balance in the relationships between grocery goods undertakings, taking into account the need to enhance consumer welfare and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">It is my intention to seek the views of all stakeholders in relation to the details of the provisions of the Code, which I hope to publish for public consultation in the coming weeks.  The Code in setting out the framework in which the different elements of the retail chain can enter into negotiations and agree contractual arrangements between themselves will help to ensure that those arrangements are balanced and fair and ultimately ensure that interests of all parties, including consumers, are respected.</p>

            <p eId="para_2073">In response to the rising numbers of unemployed including graduates, the Government has formulated and implemented a realistic and practical strategy to prioritise the activation and training of such individuals.  My Department, along with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science, have been working closely together to ensure we respond to this unemployment challenge in a significant manner. The Work Placement Programme, which was announced in the Supplementary Budget, is an initiative that has been created to provide valuable professional work experience for unemployed individuals, including graduates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">The Work Placement Programme has being created to provide 2,000 six-month work experience places for graduates and other individuals.  The aim of this scheme is to provide invaluable work experience to individuals who are unemployed, who have recently graduated from college or have very limited experience of the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">To date the number of individuals who have expressed an interest with FÁS in the Programme and who meet the eligible criteria stands at 192. In terms of places, FÁS has received 180 inquiries to date from potential providers, which has resulted in 155 actual places being offered by providers. Considering that FÁS is in the process of finalising its targeted publicity campaign of the Programme, it is encouraging that it is experiencing a considerable level of interest from individuals and providers in the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">Finally, it is my intention to review the effectiveness and impact of the Programmes upon the satisfactory completion of their roll-out.  It will be in this context that any potential changes, such as changes to the duration of the Programme, an increase in the number of places and the eligibility criteria of this Programme will be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2078">The number of apprentices notified to FÁS as redundant since 1 January 2008 is 4,933, of these 1,322 have  been referred, hence leaving a balance of 3,611.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">An apprentice  who has been referred has not yet successfully completed all elements of their required assessments and is therefore required to re-sit their outstanding off-the-job modular assessments before they can progress in their apprenticeship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">FÁS has responded to the increase in the level of redundant apprentices, especially in the construction and related sectors, by providing the following supports for redundant apprentices. Over 4,000 places will be provided under the various measures outlined as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">The Department of Social and Family Affairs immediately refers redundant apprentices to FÁS for assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">Following this immediate referral, the FÁS Employment Services and FÁS Services to Business divisions work in collaboration to provide guidance and support in sourcing a new employer and  in considering further options.  Referred Apprentices are provided with guidance in relation to preparation for a re-sit of their outstanding off-the-job modular assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">FÁS has amended the scheduling rules for off-the-job training to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training, at phase 2, phase 4 and phase 6, in accordance with the existing scheduling criteria. The number of apprentices who have been scheduled to off-the-job training at phase 2, phase 4 and phase 6 in 2008 was 619. The number of redundant apprentices provided with off-the-job training in the year to the end of June 2009 is 1507, and it is expected that up to a further 900 will be provided with off-the-job training phases before the end-year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">FÁS introduced an Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme to provide support for employers to provide on-the-job training for up to 500 redundant apprentices during 2009. This scheme assists them in taking on redundant apprentices when they have released their  own apprentices to a scheduled phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training phase in the Institutes of Technology. There are currently 197 apprentices participating on the scheme and 49 apprentices have completed their period of rotation and their performance has  been assessed.  Employers will be requested during the June and September 2009 rotation periods to provide redundant apprentices with on-the-job training with assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">Léargas has provided funding under the EU's Leonardo da Vinci programme to support the placement of 37 redundant apprentices with overseas employers to complete their phase 7 on-the-job training with assessments. Recently 19 redundant apprentices returned from Germany having completed a phase 7 placement with employers, and 12 apprentices are due to travel on 5 August 2009 for a placement in Germany. Leargas have recently provided additional funding to support the placement of an additional 60 apprentices with overseas employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">ESB Networks have agreed a programme with FÁS to provide on-the-job training to eligible redundant electrical apprentices at phase 5 and phase 7. This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of eighteen months and will be funded by ESB Networks. There are currently 100 previously redundant electrical apprentices in employment with ESB Networks, 25 redundant electrical apprentices have completed their off-the-job training with assessments and a further 75 redundant electrical apprentices will be provided with an opportunity to complete their on-the-job training before the end of December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses, which are trade related to enhance their employable skills. Redundant apprentices may also avail of the range of trade related night courses, which are available in FÁS Training Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">The Institutes of Technology are providing 700 places per annum on an 11-week certified training programme for those redundant apprentices who have completed their phase 4 training but where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available for them. The programme is divided into Construction and Engineering streams and provides redundant apprentices with education and training support in a number of relevant trade's areas. The programme is expected to commence in September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">FÁS will be providing redundant apprentices in the autumn with an opportunity to undertake phase 7 assessments where an on-the-job assessment opportunity is not currently available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">FÁS will also be providing in the autumn a facility for redundant apprentices who have reached the minimum qualifying standard in all phases 1-7 inclusive and who have not completed the minimum duration in employment as an apprentice to make an application for consideration under Recognition of Prior Learning for the Award of an  Advanced Craft Certificate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2095">I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 109 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">In terms of unemployment the Government is acutely aware of the negative impacts that unemployment can have on an individual, their family and society as a whole and has invested substantial resources in addressing the unemployment problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">FÁS employment services together with Local Employment Services have put in place measures designed to increase capacity for the rise in referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs (DSFA). Job Search/National Employment Action Plan annual referral capacity has been increased to 147,000 persons in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">The total number of training, activation and work experience places funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through FÁS in 2009 now stands at over 129,000.  This is a substantial increase when compared with those available at the end of last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">In addressing the current challenges in the labour market the Department, in conjunction with FÁS, have enacted several significant measures to improve existing suite of services available to the unemployed. These measures include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">92,000 training places on short courses are available to the unemployed and people on short-time work and will be delivered through three core-training initiatives, Short Courses, Night Courses and Online Courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">500 places on the employer based redundant apprentices rotation scheme to assist redundant apprentices progress their apprenticeships this year, which involves a subsidy being paid to employers who provide redundant apprentices with the necessary on-the-job experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">700 places on the Institutes of Technology training programme for redundant apprentices. Combined with existing initiatives for redundant apprentices this means that approximately 3,600 redundant apprentices will now be able to progress their apprenticeships or receive training.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">2000 places on the work placement programme which is providing six-month places to individuals who are unemployed including graduates. Participants on the scheme will retain their social welfare entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">277 places on a short-time training programme which is providing training to people on systematic short-time for the days they are not working</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">2,500 places for those who are unemployed to participate in part-time third level education of which my Department is funding 1,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">400 places on Community Employment Schemes, which has increased places to 22,700 this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2107">Through these initiatives Government is providing these unemployed individuals with the opportunities to improve their skills and competencies. Furthermore we are not only increasing their employability but we are also improving the skills level of our entire labour force, which will benefit us all in the years ahead</p>

            <p eId="para_2112">NERA, and its predecessor the Employment Rights Compliance Section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, processes both the enforcement of awards of both the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal through the Courts (civil enforcement cases) and prosecution cases on behalf of Inspection Services where employers fail to comply with certain employment rights legislation and in situations where employers in the construction industry fail to comply with Orders of the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">Tables 1 and 2 show the number of prosecution and civil enforcement cases referred in the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 and to end June, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">The majority of the legal costs relating to these cases was borne by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and is not known to NERA. However, NERA did incur costs in respect of legal searches and the registration of a judgement mortgage carried out in advance of certain civil enforcement cases being referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  These costs are shown in Table 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">The provision of legal services by the Chief State Solicitor's Office in support of NERA's prosecution and civil enforcement activities ceased in October 2008. NERA entered into contracts with legal firms in April 2009 for the provision of legal services to NERA. As none of these cases have yet been concluded, the actual costs in each case cannot be determined at this time.  For example, of the 29 prosecution cases referred in 2009 to date, summonses have issued in 15 cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_2348">For the purpose of promoting investment and jobs in Dublin, the Enterprise Development agencies do not distinguish between individual postal districts of the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">As regards foreign direct investment, there are some 450 IDA Ireland supported companies in the city employing over 50,000 people.  In the past week IBM Corporation, the largest information technology company in the world, announced its intention to make an investment of over €25 million in an expansion of its Ireland Software Lab.  The expansion will see the company create 100 new software engineering positions in its Ireland Software Lab located in Dublin. In addition, Rottapharm, which is located in Mulhuddart, announced a significant expansion of its Irish manufacturing with a  €7 million investment and an increase in employment of 35 people in new high level positions, which will bring employment at the site to 150 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">In relation to indigenous industry, Enterprise Ireland is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs who are setting up High Potential Start-Up Companies.  The agency is also focused on the retention and creation of  jobs in existing companies.  Since the beginning of 2008, Enterprise Ireland has approved over €47m and made payments of over €30m in support of development projects for indigenous companies in the north Dublin area.  These include support for development and expansion of campus company activity to encourage and support the commercialisation of research and development carried out in the third level sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">The recently established Enterprise Stabilisation Fund will enable internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets. Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">Enterprise Ireland has also provided funding for Campus Incubation Centres in Dublin City University, Blanchardstown Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and in the National College of Ireland located in the International Financial Services Centre. Enterprise Ireland also supports Third Level Colleges to foster links with industry thereby encouraging industry to increase its use of technology.  Under the Innovation Partnership and Research Funding Programme, Enterprise Ireland approved over €33m in supports and made payments in excess of €24m since the beginning of 2007 in support of such projects in the north Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">The agency has made significant investment in Community Enterprise Centres in the North Dublin area to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises through local community participation. Under the various Community Enterprise Centre Schemes, Centres were supported in Coolock and Darndale.  Those centres are now fully occupied and provide vital accommodation for micro enterprise companies in their formative years. Enterprise Ireland has also funded Community Enterprise Centres in Ballymun, Gloucester Place, North King Street, Oxmantown Lane, the Bolton Trust Centre at East Wall Road and at Mulhuddart and Balbriggan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">Finally, the Dublin City Enterprise Board provides support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases in manufacturing, tourism and services.  The Board supports individuals, firms and community groups.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2356">The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) 2006-2013 aims to ensure that Ireland, by 2013, will be internationally renowned for the excellence of its research, and will be to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture. The SSTI recognises the vital contribution that highly educated, professional and effective researchers can make to the development of Ireland's knowledge economy. It acknowledges the importance of putting conditions in place to facilitate our Higher Education Institutions, Public Sector Research Institutes and private enterprise in the recruitment and retention of such researchers. The Strategy highlights the importance of people embarking on 4th level studies having a clear sense of career path options, whether they be in academia, enterprise or administration and calls for the development of a sustainable career path for researchers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">Following publication of the SSTI, the Advisory Science Council (ASC) was requested to consider how the Government could best facilitate the development of researcher careers and to prepare recommendations. The Council's report ‘Towards a Framework for Researcher Careers' was published in October 2008. The report contains a number of key recommendations including:</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">The establishment of a distinctive and transparent Framework for Developing Professional Careers within the HEIs which would also be recognised and have relevance for the enterprise sector;</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">That terms and conditions under which researchers are employed should be consistent irrespective of the sources of funding for their positions;</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">That funding agencies and HEIs should establish a programme to ensure Ireland reaches the EU average of female participation rates among senior academic levels by 2018;</p>
            <p eId="para_2361">That funding agencies should increase the level of funding available to humanities and social sciences to further support researcher careers in these disciplines;</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">That the HEIs, public sector research institutes and enterprise need collectively to develop and implement a researcher careers competency framework;</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">That a national programme should be established providing career information, including information on the personal and professional researcher skills required by each sector — HEIs, the public sector and enterprise,</p>
            <p eId="para_2364">That, as the first stage of professional career development of researchers, Graduate Schools should be developed to ensure PhD students learn practical business skills such as project management, people and financial management, marketing and skills required for the commercialisation of research;</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">That funding agencies should facilitate international mobility, both inward and outward, among all researchers by providing continuity of funding to those seeking international experience and those that seek to return to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2366">The Higher Education Research Group (HERG), which is chaired by the Department of Education and Science, oversees and has responsibility for the coherent development of policy and funding initiatives arising under the SSTI which pertain to the higher education and research sector. Following publication of the ASC's report, a Researchers Careers Working Group was subsequently established under the aegis of the Higher Education Research Group to focus on the development of a clearly and broadly consistent path for career progression across the higher education sector. The group is chaired by the Department of Education and Science and comprises representatives of employers, funders and promoters of research, the Higher Education Authority and Forfás.</p>
            <p eId="para_2367">My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, has informed me that the Researcher Careers Group has met on three occasions to date. In addition DES have engaged in bilateral meetings with a number of key stakeholders. The Group has recently concluded its work and has prepared a report containing proposals to develop a framework for a national researcher careers structure which incorporates clear definitions of title, a performance development and appraisal system, continuing professional skills development and is underpinned by the guiding principle that attainment of titles must be based on a transparent, open and competitive process. An initial briefing on the Researchers Careers Working Group report has been given to the HERG and it is proposed to formally submit the report to the next scheduled meeting of the HERG in September.</p>

            <p eId="para_2369">FÁS Job Clubs were introduced in 1999 to assist people who were actively seeking employment by providing support for the job search process and an environment in which it could be carried out.  Independent Sponsor Groups are contracted by FÁS on a year to year basis to run the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2370">Job Clubs are seen as an important resource and intervention for those who have recently completed training programmes or have recently become unemployed.  They provide both a formal and structured input as well as a drop-in resource facility.  They also help the individual in overcoming the personal effects of unemployment by providing a mutual support forum from people in a similar situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">56 Job Clubs nationwide provided formal programmes to the following numbers of clients for the past three years:</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">2006: 6,417;</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">2007: 7,100;</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">2008: 8,814.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">I understand that the number of "drop-ins" would be approximately double these figures.  During 2009 it is proposed to increase the number of Job Clubs to over 60.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2510">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) currently has in place a team of 77 inspectors.  They are all employed under the standard terms and conditions governing civil servants in general.  Inspectors are entitled to receive travel and subsistence in respect of expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their official duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">There are no proposals at present to increase the number of inspectors.  The Minister for Finance has recently introduced a moratorium on the filling of vacancies in the Public Service until the end of 2010, which will impact on NERA in common with all other public bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">The total costs, comprising pay and travel and subsistence costs, in relation to activities and operations of NERA's Inspection Services are set out in Table 1. It has not been possible, in the time available, to apportion other non-pay costs between the different services within NERA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">Data in relation to inspection activity is currently maintained on a case basis and information in relation to the number of unique employers visited is not readily available.  The data provided in Table 2 below represents an indicative estimate by NERA of the number of employers visited.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">The inspection process includes calls, visits and inspections in respect of each case.  In 2008 a total of 27,900 were carried out.  The figure to date in 2009 is 10,445. NERA inspectors have an enforcement role under aspects of the following legislation:</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">Industrial Relations Acts 1946-2004 — (1) Employment Regulation Orders (Joint Labour Committee system) and (2) Registered Employment Agreement system,</p>

            <p eId="para_2526">NERA will shortly be commencing inspections under the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">In the course of 2008, prosecution proceedings were initiated by NERA in 70 cases.  Proceedings were concluded in 88 cases, which included cases initiated in 2007. Convictions were obtained in 41 cases while in the balance of 47 cases the breaches were rectified before the court hearing or the cases were withdrawn or struck out.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">In the course of 2009 to date prosecution proceedings have been initiated by NERA in 29 cases.  Proceedings were concluded in 59 cases. Convictions were obtained in 13 cases while in the balance of 46 cases the breaches were rectified before the court hearing or the cases were withdrawn or struck out.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">NERA inspections indicate a very broad variance in the level of compliance with employment legislation. The level of compliance ranges from over 90% in Protection of Young Persons and National Minimum Wage to 55% in respect of Organisation of Working Time Act and is as low as 15% in relation to compliance with some Employment Regulation Orders.  It would appear the higher the level of awareness the higher the compliance level. This supports the view that most employers want to comply with employment law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2530">Some of the more serious illegal practices NERA has uncovered include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2531">Failure to pay the appropriate rate;</p>
            <p eId="para_2532">Falsifying records including payslips and timesheets;</p>

         if her preferential claim against a company (details supplied) under the Redundancy Payments Acts will be struck out; and if she will expedite a response in view of the circumstances of the case.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2583">It is up to the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy entitlement to employees.  When an employer does so, he is entitled to claim a rebate of 60% from the Social Insurance Fund.  If the employer is unable to pay the statutory amount, then the employee can, ultimately, be paid directly by my Department from the Fund.  In such cases, 40% of each statutory redundancy lump sum paid is recoverable from the assets of the employer by the Department for the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">This statutory Redundancy Recoveries function is provided for in Sections 42 and 43 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 (as subsequently amended).  Section 42 of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 — 2007 confers on the Minister, preferential creditor status in a winding-up situation in recovering amounts paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Thus, a redundancy lump sum (or part thereof) is made a priority debt under Section 285 of the Companies Act, 1963, in cases of winding-up, and a priority debt under Section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, in cases of a bankrupt or arranging debtor.  Section 43 of the 1967 Act also makes general provision whereby all monies due to the Fund (whether in a winding-up situation or not) are debts, which can be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">In the present case, my Department paid a statutory redundancy lump sum in favour of a former employee of the company from the Social Insurance Fund and the Department was involved in written communication with the company at the time.  The company was also advised of the fact that given that the payment was made directly from the Social Insurance Fund, the Minister, in line with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts referred to, had preferential creditor status.</p>
            <p eId="para_2586">The Minister has no discretion with regard to the 40% due to the Social Insurance Fund in terms of any legal powers to divert, from the Social Insurance Fund, monies which may be recovered from the assets of the company at some future point and the Minister is not in a position to strike off the outstanding liability to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the

         the full extent of job losses and job creation throughout County Kildare in each of the past five years to date in 2009 in the manufacturing service or knowledge based areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2588">Employment data in respect of companies supported by the Enterprise Agencies (Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development) is collated by Forfás on an annual basis only, and accordingly data is not available for 2009. The knowledge agenda transcends all sectors of the economy and data is not categorised on this basis. Data on job gains and job losses in Kildare County in Manufacturing and Services for the years 2004-2008 is shown in the table.  This table indicates that 1,055 jobs net were lost in the manufacturing sector in the 5 year period, while there was a net increase of 310 in the numbers employed in the Services sector in the same period. At end 2008 the numbers employed in Co. Kildare in enterprise agency assisted firms stood at 14,478.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Co. Kildare as a location for investment as part of an integrated East Region, with access to a population base of 1.5 million people, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county.  The agencies are working closely with educational institutions in the county, and with FÁS in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county and to provide guidance in developing the skills needed by those already in the workforce, who are interested in upskilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2590">At present there are 25 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kildare County employing 9,837 people, and in recent years IDA have succeeded in attracting some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Wyeth Medica, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard. In the present competitive global markets, it is increasingly difficult to continue to attract such facilities, as manufacturing companies, in particular, are going to low cost destinations. Despite the downturn, Kildare remains very attractive for FDI as evidenced by the recent announcement by Hewlett Packard of the expansion of its Global Service Desk operation at its Liffey Park Technology Campus in Leixlip, which will result in the creation of 500 jobs over the next 12 months in the areas of technical support, R&amp;D and training.  A further example of the attractiveness of the county is the recent announcement of the expansion of the Oral B facility creating 100 jobs in Newbridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies. Since the beginning of 2005<b>,</b> Enterprise Ireland has approved over €15m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets. The consumer foods sector in particular has shown rapid growth in recent years. The last two years have seen significant investment by Green Isle Foods and Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, both supported by Enterprise Ireland, leading to significant employment increases in both of these facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">In 2009, EI's priority is to consolidate the position of existing Irish exporters in key markets (notably UK and US), and to identify and exploit new export opportunities across the Eurozone and in other selected markets. Enterprise Ireland is focusing additional resources on the Eurozone, with the objective of helping Irish companies to win sales in these markets. A number of markets have also been identified that are less affected by the global downturn, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and the Gulf region. Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions, international buyer programmes and client promotional activities at trade fairs, conferences and exhibitions are vital in establishing presences in international markets for goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">During 2008, Enterprise Ireland launched a new Growth Fund, which provides clients with funding of up to €450,000 to help them achieve greater competitiveness by investing in new equipment, implementing new processes, training staff, or hiring key managers or consultants. In 2008, a total €26.23 million was approved under the Growth Fund to support 84 competitiveness improvement projects. This fund will continue to support companies' competitiveness over the next two years.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_523">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2632">I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2633">There are many differing and complex factors, apart from costs, that influence a firm's decision to relocate. Therefore, it is not currently possible to say how many jobs have ‘relocated' from Ireland over the past ten years. Job ‘churn' occurs in the internationally trading sector of the economy, in a number of ways and for a variety of reasons. Companies adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology, in addition to business takeovers and consolidations. For much of the last decade this churn has been positive for Ireland, with companies replacing lower value activities with activities of higher value, resulting in better paid, more highly skilled jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2634">The phenomenon of globalisation is changing the way economic production is organised the world over. Lower barriers to trade and improvements in transport technology are increasing the specialisation of production, resulting in global supply chains. Ireland experiences both benefits and costs resulting from globalisation. Inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) illustrates the clearest demonstration of the benefits to Ireland from globalisation. This has been one of the principal causes of the strong economic performance of Ireland over the last two decades. However, as Ireland has gained from the mobility of modern production and supply chain models, competition from other locations for mobile investment has intensified. This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2635">Of course, some churn can be negative, when it results in a net loss of employment. Total job numbers employed in enterprise agency supported companies, (which represents a large portion of employment in the internationally traded sector of the economy), increased by approximately 7.5%, in the 10 years to 2008. The global economic downturn has seen a decline in the number of people employed in the internationally trading element of the economy in 2008/09, but this is a phenomenon being experienced by economies at every stage of development around the globe. The International Labour Organisation forecasts global unemployment to rise considerably, over the immediate term. The decline in the level of employment in Ireland's internationally trading sectors cannot therefore be simply related to job ‘relocation' alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2636">Competitiveness can naturally decline in certain areas when an economy becomes more advanced — for example, developed economies cannot compete with developing countries in certain areas of low value, labour intensive production. However, competitiveness is vital to ensure Ireland continues to win investment in the areas of manufacturing and service activity in which it competes with other developed economies, such as high value manufacturing and internationally traded services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2637">A principal task of government is to ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive place to do business, and to help foster economic competencies higher up the value chain. This government has made significant attempts to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communication infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning. The Enterprise Strategy Group report outlines the strategy being pursued by Government to move all enterprises in Ireland towards higher value added and knowledge based activities. Subsequent reports and strategies including the "<i>Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, 2006-2013</i>”, the “<i>National Skills Strategy</i>” and “<i>Building Ireland’s Smart Economy</i>” further develop and build on these objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2638">Competitiveness is a key driver of economic development and my Department closely monitors Ireland's competitiveness for this reason — by a variety of means including the National Competitiveness Council's annual work in the area, which involves benchmarking the country's competitiveness performance against key competitors across more than 140 competitiveness indicators. The results of this analysis highlight areas where action needs to be taken to improve Irish competitiveness for enterprise, and informs the policy measures formulated to support Irish economic development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2639">The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes. The "<i>Report of the High-Level Group on Manufacturing</i>” contains some 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development, which will ensure Irish manufacturers, can continue to compete successfully on international markets and provide high value sustainable employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2640">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries. The report of the Services Strategy Group, "<i>Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland</i>”, sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland’s services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential. Implementation of the recommendations – some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_524">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2642">In the period 2003-2008, annual growth in total Irish exports has averaged 5.5%.  Over the five years in question our services exports have risen steadily from €37.1bn or 31.1% of total exports in 2003 to €69.2bn or 44.5% in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">With regard to total imports, the annual growth rate averaged 6.6%. The growth in Merchandise imports showed an average annual growth rate of 3.9%, while the average annual growth in our Services imports was 9.1%.  Between 2003-2008 our Services imports rose from being 50.7% to 56.6% of our total Services imports.  Our trade surplus in 2008 was €23.79bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">These healthy trade levels were achieved despite poor economic growth in many of our trading partners and also against the backdrop of adverse exchange rate trends in our two biggest export markets, the United States and the United Kingdom.  Our performance is especially significant when compared to our EU partners.   The latest figures released by Eurostat, demonstrate that in several of the major Member States, exports declined by over 20% in the first quarter of this year, whereas Ireland's were virtually unchanged at -0.01%. Over recent years, net exports have made a very significant contribution to GDP growth. In 2008 the contribution of net exports was 2.7% and in the first quarter of 2009 it was 6.09%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through Enterprise Ireland, is active both in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets for their products and services and to increase their existing level of market share.  Both my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mary Coughlan T.D. and I, have been active in leading trade missions to develop new opportunities for Irish exporters, in association with Enterprise Ireland. We will continue to do so, to both existing long- established markets, to the new EU Member States and also to other emerging high-growth markets, with a view to increasing the share of exports by Irish companies worldwide.  To illustrate the success of these efforts, our exports to the eight priority countries identified in our Asia <i> Strategy</i>, have more than doubled in five years to over €11bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">The importance of our Services trade to the economy is growing. The future performance in services activities will therefore be increasingly important to overall growth in the economy.  The Services Strategy Group, which was set up in 2007 by Forfás and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, published its report — "<i>Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland</i>”, in September last. The report sets out new policy proposals on how the State can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland’s services sector.  The recommendations in this report will guide the development of our services strategy into the future, to further exploit the opportunities that this sector presents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">The manufacturing sector is in transition but is well positioned to meet future challenges.  Ireland's manufacturing future depends on a manufacturing sector that is capital intensive, knowledge intensive and skills intensive, focused on developing innovative products, services and solutions and meeting the needs of markets and customers. The 2007 report of the <i>High Level Group on Manufacturing</i> identifies the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland and these are being pursued through the Government Framework for Economic Renewal.</p>

            <p eId="para_2650">One of the primary areas of focus in my Department is on growing exports.  The most recent export figures are encouraging.  Year-on-year Irish exports to April rose by 6%.  Year-on-year pharmaceutical exports rose by 19%.  Our export performance is in turn dependant on our productivity levels and our competitiveness.  The Government has taken and will continue to take the necessary steps to improve our competitiveness and productivity in order to return to economic growth at sustainable levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_2652">Under the framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to improve our competitiveness.  Cost competitiveness is a particular focus of action and we are already seeing results.  Firstly, Irish inflation declined by 4.7% in the year to May 2009.  We have also seen a decline in unit labour costs which has a direct effect on competitiveness. We will continue to exert further downward pressure on costs including reviewing the recommendations of the Competition Authority which have most effect on competitiveness. We are working to ease costs to enterprise in administered sectors of the economy under state control such as local authority charges.  We are also easing the administrative burden that regulations can create.</p>
            <p eId="para_2653">Energy prices have come down in recent months and I will continue to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure that we continue to exert downward pressure on energy costs.  Across Government there is a concerted approach to eliminate structural rigidities that have contributed to high costs.  The current initiative to legislate against upward only rent reviews is a further example of this cross Government effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_2654">With regard to credit, we have taken determined action to address the fundamental issue of access to finance for business, by way of the new code of practice for banks linked to the re-capitalisation scheme.   The Minister for Finance and I have, furthermore, recently established the Credit Supply Clearing Group to examine where the flow of credit to viable business appears to be blocked and develop solutions that enable adequate business credit flow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2655">In addition the Minister for Trade and Commerce, Billy Kelleher TD, is holding a series of regional meetings around the country to assess the factors affecting access to bank credit at local and regional level.  These meetings allow the Government to hear at first hand the views and experiences of local business representative groups, local bank representatives and state agencies on access to bank lending.  This will complement the work of the Credit Supply Clearing Group and feed into future Government policies on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2656">To improve the competitive strengths of firms we continue to implement a series of policies to encourage a move to higher productivity levels and the production of higher value added goods and services.  Our competitiveness priorities also include a strong focus on skills, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_2657">Furthermore, our long-term commitment to investing in and supporting science will, I am confident, bring an additional dimension to our competitiveness as well as taking us to a new level of innovation and entrepreneurial activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_2659">Ultimately it is individual businesses that must take advantage of global markets but it is my responsibility to ensure that no barriers are placed in their way.  In this regard, my immediate competitiveness objectives are to ensure that the broad business environment is conducive to improved export opportunities and to facilitate a return to sustainable export growth.  We will continue to provide the appropriate supports to the enterprise sector, restore our cost competitiveness and safeguard the significant achievements of recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2660">Our current enterprise policies are focused on driving export growth momentum by supporting companies to pursue aggressive and progressive growth strategies.  Our priorities include strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a series of targeted initiatives provided by the development agencies.  A central priority is to ensure that companies with high growth potential and in which the State has already invested are brought through this difficult period.  These are companies that will continue to be successful on world markets and will provide essential high-value employment in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2661">Irish exporters have proved themselves well able to compete decisively on world markets. Between 2003 and 2007 our total Irish exports increased by more than 6% per annum year-on-year. Merchandise exports for the first quarter of 2009 were up by 2% and rose further  in April, giving us a trade surplus for that month of just over €4bn, the highest monthly surplus in eight years and the second highest on record.</p>

            <p eId="para_2722">The Enterprise Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, namely IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the Employment Training agency FAS, provide incentives to assist with jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">As part of its marketing strategy to attract foreign direct investment into Ireland, IDA Ireland offers a range of assistance to its clients.  The four main types of grants available are employment grants, capital grants, research and development grants and training grants.  The agency also offers a range of tailored property solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients throughout all regions to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of employment, innovation and exports, which in turn, stimulates job creation.  The agency, in recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that will be undertaken to help clients in 2009. Enterprise Ireland has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of its client base.  The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund is a new initiative which I announced recently. This Fund, which is being administered by Enterprise Ireland, will help internationally trading companies to survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets. Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2725">The types of direct grant-aid available from the CEBs include capital grants, feasibility study grants and employment grants.  The 2009 allocation for the CEBs will enable the Boards to continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development. This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice, all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2726">In relation to FÁS, the agency provides a range of incentives that are available for clients and employers.  The recently announced Work Placement Programme is designed to offer unemployed people, including unemployed graduates, the opportunity to obtain 6 months quality experience in a work situation.  The benefit to providers is that they will, by giving someone the opportunity to gain work experience in their field, ensure the future supply of qualified and experienced people for their business or sector.  Additionally, should a position become available within the business, they would have a prospective applicant with relevant work experience.  The agency also promotes a range of supports and grants including the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Supported Employment Programme.  The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than twenty hours per week. Subsidies available through this scheme are structured under three separate strands and employers can benefit under one or all, simultaneously.  The Supported Employment Programme is an active labour market initiative to assist jobseeker's with a disability to find employment in the open labour market.  The programme facilitates the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market and provides support for the jobseeker and employer through a job coach to assist with the integration process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2727">I am satisfied that the range of actions which I have outlined will continue to address the jobs situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2877">The Government remains intent on achieving greater capacity within existing resources to meet the on-going challenges in the labour market.  This year the Government have almost doubled the number of FÁS activation training and work experience places for the unemployed to over 129,000.  This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year.  The majority of these additional places are on short courses and will be delivered through three core-training initiatives, Short Courses, Night Courses and Online Courses.  These courses are designed to develop new skills and competencies for the unemployed to assist them in securing employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">Other new programmes which have been rolled out for the unemployed are the Work Placement Programme and the Short time Training Programme. The Work Placement Programme is a six-month work experience programme for 2,000 individuals who are currently unemployed. Under this programme individuals will retain their social welfare entitlements. The Short Time Working Training Programme<b> </b>will provide two days training a week for 277 workers over a 52-week period who are on systematic short time.  Participants on this programme will also continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">Recently the Government presented proposals to the Social Partners which focused on measures to prevent job losses including the possible introduction of a temporary employment subsidy scheme which aims to help employees retain their jobs and employers their skilled workforce in these difficult times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">The Government is also committed to pursuing a job creation strategy that focuses on strengthening our competitiveness, driving down the cost of doing business here and ensuring our return to sustainable export-led growth.  My Department's enterprise development agencies will continue to play a key role in supporting companies in creating new job opportunities.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the

         the extent of her job creation proposals for the future; if emphasis on the knowledge based economy is likely to ignore the need to generate growth in the manufacturing sector; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that other jurisdictions are more competitive in the manufacturing sectors, are more than likely to become more competitive in the knowledge based economic sectors in the future and that action is required to address these issues; the action she has taken in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_531">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2882">The development of innovative products and services, underpinned by the effective and imaginative use of technology and new research, will be significant contributors to our economic success and job creation in the coming years.  We have indeed been seeking, in our policy development and investment, to grow our innovation capacity to develop a knowledge economy.  This will put the benefits and opportunities of science, technology and innovation at the heart of Irish economic and social development and grow our enterprise sector in a sustainable manner, thereby creating jobs and facilitate social advancement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">But this in no way diminishes the importance of manufacturing in our economy. The competitiveness model Ireland has to follow is one where innovation, talent and flexibility are our acknowledged core competencies and this is relevant for all industry sectors, including both our existing manufacturing base and for new investment in manufacturing that we continue to attract.</p>
            <p eId="para_2884">Under the Framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to improve our competitiveness.  Cost competitiveness is a particular focus of action and we are already seeing results.  Firstly, Irish inflation declined by 4.7% in the year to May 2009.  We have also seen a decline in unit labour costs which has a direct effect on competitiveness. Other costs are on the way down also.  The cost of energy which is a key cost for the manufacturing sector, has reduced by 10% in electricity prices and 12% in the price of gas.  I will continue to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure that we continue to exert downward pressure on energy costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2885">Our policy measures for developing the knowledge economy are designed to translate knowledge into jobs and growth.  This includes many horizontal policies, such as education and skills development, along with the development of framework conditions to encourage both technological and non-technological innovation.  For the manufacturing sector, this encompasses a broad range of areas, whether it is assisting manufacturing companies to realise the full potential of information technology, to adopt new technologies or leading edge processes or supporting R&amp;D in manufacturing operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2886">Manufacturing will continue to play a valuable part in future economic success as was clearly demonstrated in the report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing. The recommendations contained in this report are being advanced within the Framework for Economic Renewal to ensure that the manufacturing sector is further developed and well positioned for future growth.   I would like to emphasise that, as stated in the report, manufacturing is a key driver of innovation and technological advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2887">Sustainable growth must be based on growing Ireland's manufacturing and services export base, and we are firmly focused on providing a competitive environment and maintaining our reputation as a ‘good place to do business'.</p>

         the restructuring which will take place within Enterprise Ireland in 2009 and 2010; and the new initiatives which have been introduced in the past 12 months to protect jobs and create employment in Cork city and county.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_532">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2889">Enterprise Ireland (EI) developed a one year plan for 2009 to run in parallel to EI's existing strategy ‘Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010'.</p>
            <p eId="para_2890">The priorities of this plan are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2891">a. Access to Finance</p>
            <p eId="para_2892">b. Winning New Sales &amp; Sustaining Exports</p>
            <p eId="para_2893">c. Stimulating Competitiveness</p>
            <p eId="para_2894">d. Promoting Innovation</p>
            <p eId="para_2895">e. Supporting Entrepreneurship</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">The primary focus of export growth remains an organisational priority, which Enterprise Ireland is supporting through the reorientation of resources and the introduction of a number of initiatives in 2009, all of which are open to client companies in the Cork Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">(A) A major initiative is the recent establishment by the Government of a €100 million Enterprise Stabilisation Fund for 2009-2010 to help internationally trading companies with robust business models that would otherwise struggle to survive the global downturn. EI also continues to work closely with international and domestic venture capitalists, the banks and the European Investment Bank to secure finance for Irish enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">(B) In 2009, the agency's priority is to consolidate the position of existing Irish exporters in key markets (notably UK and US), and to identify and exploit new export opportunities across the Eurozone and in other selected markets. Enterprise Ireland is also working to emphasise the role that public procurement plays in economic recovery and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">(C) During 2008, Enterprise Ireland launched a new Growth Fund, which provides funding to help clients invest in new equipment, implement new processes, train staff, or hire key personnel. In 2008, a total €26.23 million was approved under the Growth Fund to support 84 competitiveness improvement projects. Two new departments are in the process of being established to help companies drive down costs. The Cost Reduction and Lean Manufacturing units are staffed by personnel who have considerable experience and expertise in manufacturing efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">(D) The agency is continuing to promote the importance of R&amp;D and innovation in companies. In the immediate term, Enterprise Ireland's priority is to help companies to maintain their current R&amp;D levels and encourage them to focus on 6-12 month projects that will yield a short-term positive return, and EI has streamlined its approval and payments procedures to support this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">(E) EI's strategic approach to regional enterprise aims to foster innovation-based start-ups, to proactively develop existing clients in all regions, and to facilitate entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in local and rural communities. EI supported 71 High Potential Start-Ups in 2008, nine of which were located in Cork City and County, with a strong pipeline in place for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2902">Other initiatives include tailored Enterprise Start Programmes, aimed at employees of multi-nationals, which are either down-sizing or closing, have proved very successful in Cork.  A programme was run in 2007 for Motorola employees, with the second programme being run for Freescale Limited employees in Cork, when Freescale Limited terminated operations in Cork, in 2008.  In 2009, another programme was run for employees from Pfizer.  Enterprise Ireland continues to work with relevant agencies to assist companies in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2905">Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 6 months while claims submitted by post are taking 7 months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where the employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time, assuming all of the necessary supporting documentation is filed, is between 6 — 8 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2906">Measures to deal with the huge influx of claims since January 2009 include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2907">the reassignment of 19.5 additional staff from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands;</p>
            <p eId="para_2908">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2909">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and co-operation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA);</p>

         the consideration given to a scrappage scheme for cars older than ten years similar to that introduced in the UK in recent months; if an estimate of the revenue from such a scheme is available; the number of jobs that are at risk in that sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2931">I am aware of the current challenges facing the motor industry, along with most other industries, arising from the impact of weak world economic activity. As the Deputy will be aware the Supplementary Budget announced the introduction of a VAT Margin Scheme for second-hand cars, with effect from 1 July 2009. Under the scheme, dealers would be taxed for VAT purposes on their margin (i.e. the difference between the prices at which the dealer purchased and subsequently resold a vehicle) in regard to second-hand cars they acquired and resold after that date. In conjunction with the introduction of the Margin Scheme, special transitional arrangements were to be put in place regarding second-hand cars in stock on the introduction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2932">The Margin Scheme would have replaced the existing Special Scheme for second-hand cars, under which dealers/garages are entitled to immediate input credit for the residual VAT included in the price of a second-hand car acquired either through purchase or trade-in.  Under the Special Scheme, dealers, when they resell the car, are required to repay this VAT input credit or VAT based on the resale price of the car, whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_2933">Further discussions on the matter took place with SIMI and the motor industry decided, on balance, that it would not be in its overall best interest for the Margin Scheme to be introduced at that time. Consequently, the proposed Margin Scheme and transitional arrangements regarding existing stock of second-hand cars was not introduced in the 2009 Finance Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2934">There will be ongoing dialogue over the coming months with SIMI as to what measures might be introduced to assist the motor industry, particularly with regard to removing the current stock of second-hand cars held by dealers. I have no plans to introduce a car scrappage scheme at this time.</p>

These contracts are generally of two to three years duration — this has proven to be a reasonable period having regard to factors such as the protracted timescale involved in organising tender competitions, the requirement for a reasonable degree of certainty and stability (including price stability) for customers, the need for contracts to be of sufficient duration for suppliers to achieve an adequate return on investment, and the desire of unsuccessful tenderers to have new opportunities to compete for the business.</p>

Generally with long term leases, Rent Reviews and Lease Breaks are on a five-year basis.  Where agreement for Rent Reviews and Lease Breaks are included in the terms of a lease, due notice must be given before negotiations will be entered into.

Negotiations can only take where the lease provides for such an event. Where a rent review arises, the Office of Public Works is entering negotiations with a view to effecting a reduction in rent.</p>

            <p eId="para_3043">The legalities involved in the transfer of the site of the Civic Centre from Dublin City Council are ongoing and, as they are yet to be finalised, it is still not possible to formalise tenancy details, including rent. As the Deputy has been previously informed, the occupiers were advised at the outset of indicative rents, and, when the legalities of the transfer from Dublin City Council to OPW are complete and the necessary tenancy details formalised, all outstanding monies will be sought.</p>

            <p eId="para_3045">The Deputy's question refers to the redemption fee applied by mortgage providers in circumstances where a customer seeks to break a fixed rate mortgage. On 26 March 2009  I undertook to contact the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator about these fees.   As a result the Financial Regulator carried out a review, a report of which has been submitted to my Department.   The Financial Regulator asked for specific information from the mortgage lenders. This included the submission of independent actuarial reports based on the formulae applied by the different lenders. The FR's review based on the information that it had received concludes that lenders are not applying unjustified penalties intended to dissuade borrowers from early redemption of fixed rate mortgages. The principal findings indicate that the early redemption fee calculation in all cases appears to seek to cover the costs and lenders do not generally apply additional fees in the case of early redemption.  However, a number of the reports received highlighted certain issues that will require follow-up. Additional work is being carried out by the Financial Regulator with regard to the information provided by institutions, which will include consideration of the mortgage funding models employed by them.</p>

            <p eId="para_3115">There is no €3,000,000 turnover requirement for companies to tender for public contracts. A general requirement of this kind would be inappropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3116">However, it is essential that contractors performing any public contract be of sufficiently sound economic and financial standing. The general position is that criteria used to determine the appropriate level of financial capacity must be proportionate and relevant to the needs of the particular contract. Company turnover can be one measure of financial capacity but contracting authorities have other means of obtaining the necessary evidence to satisfy themselves in this regard, such as extracts from balance sheets, banker's letters and proof of access to professional indemnity, public liability and employer liability insurance and performance bonds.</p>

            <p eId="para_3196">The current thresholds above which public contracts must be awarded in accordance with EU public procurement directives are for works contracts €5,150,000; for supplies and services contracts of Government Departments — €133,000; for supplies and services contracts of other public bodies — €206,000; for supplies and services contracts of entities in the utilities sector — €412,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3197">The directives provide for the pre-selection of tenderers to participate in a tendering process.  The purpose is to ensure that only tenderers who have the necessary technical expertise and capacity to perform the contract are awarded public contracts.  The level of expertise and capacity for pre-selection must be proportionate and relevant to the needs of the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_3198">Contracting authorities have the choice of pre-qualifying tenderers in a one stage or two stage tendering procedure.  In a one stage open procedure, candidates are given all the tender documentation, including the necessary minimum capacity requirements, and invited to submit tenders.  Procurement guidelines require that minimum conditions are made clear to avoid unqualified bidders incurring the expense of preparing and submitting tenders.  Alternatively, contracting authorities may choose a two stage process whereby, as a first step, interested parties are asked to provide details of their capacity and expertise after which only those who meet the necessary standard are invited to submit tenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">While the public procurement directives set out the relevant criteria and procedures for pre-qualification of tenderers for contracts covered by the directives, the principles of pre-qualifying suitable tenderers apply for all public contracts.</p>

Furthermore, there had been some 17 applications from public servants.  Departments are reporting a high level of queries about the scheme.  It is anticipated therefore, at this stage, that significantly higher numbers of applications will be received by the time of the closing date on 1 September next, although, at this stage, it is not possible to quantify the likely number of applicants.</p>

Other areas of the public service have set later dates for applications so that the overall impact of the scheme cannot be assessed until later this year.  The HSE has suspended the scheme because several Trades Union have instructed their members not to co-operate with redeployments arising from the operation of the schemes outlined in the supplementary budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_3214">The Department of Finance Circular 26/2006 sets out details of a confined competition for promotion to Executive Officer in the Civil Service.  In accordance with normal procedure in respect of promotion to this grade, the circular was agreed with the Civil and Public Services Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_3215">The terms of the circular did not envisage appointments being made from the competition after 30 June 2008.  For operational reasons, my Department agreed with the CPSU to the extension of the panel until 30 June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3216">In the context of the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers, in March 2009 the Government announced a moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service.  Having regard to the moratorium, my Department decided that it would not be appropriate to seek any further extension to the panel set up under Circular 26/2006 and the panel closed on 30 June 2009.  This is in line with the policy applying to promotion panels for other Civil Service grades where panels for promotion to the grades of higher executive officer, assistant principal officer and principal officer have also closed in recent months.</p>

            <p eId="para_3224">In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3225">In addition, member states may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use.  The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.</p>

            <p eId="para_3228">The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and came into effect in May 2002.  Under the legislation governing that scheme hospitals are required to be certified by the HSE as satisfying the qualifying conditions of the scheme.  My Department's records show that five hospitals have been certified since the introduction of the scheme.  These hospitals have indicated a capacity to provide in excess of 500 beds, including day care beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">As regards hospitals which are under construction, capital allowances can be claimed for qualifying expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals only when the relevant facilities have been completed and become operational.  Provided hospitals, either planned or under construction, are certified in due course, as private hospitals meeting the necessary qualifying conditions and also satisfy the criteria under the transitional arrangements for the termination of the scheme detailed below, qualifying expenditure can be written off against an investor's tax liability at the rate of 15% per annum for the first six years with the remaining 10% in year seven.  It is not possible to say at this point, however, how many hospital projects in the pipeline will qualify under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">As announced in the budget on 7 April last and as reflected in section 8 of the Finance Act 2009, this scheme is to terminate on 31 December 2009 along with certain other health-related capital allowances schemes, subject to transitional arrangements for pipeline projects.  Under the transitional arrangements, if certain qualifying criteria are met, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">The qualifying conditions depend on the type of work to be carried out and whether or not the work requires planning permission.  Where the work to be carried out does not require planning permission, the termination date is 30 June 2010 so long as at least 30% of the construction or refurbishment costs have been incurred on or before 31 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">Where planning permission is required in respect of the work to be carried out, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission be submitted on or before that date and be acknowledged by the relevant planning authority.  In such cases, the termination date for qualifying expenditure in the case of qualifying hospitals is 31 December 2013.  Thus, where planning permission for a private hospital has already been obtained, Finance Act 2009 provides for qualifying expenditure to be incurred up to 31 December 2013.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3244">I propose to take Questions Nos. 181, 189, 190, 205 and 234 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3245">I have, in recent weeks, reported in detail to both Houses on the situation regarding the negotiation of a new bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  This process has been on-going since the start of 2008 and the dialogue with the Vietnamese authorities is continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3246">In light of concerns raised by other countries during 2008, the Government decided that it was necessary to seek a strengthening of the bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  With the publication of the Adoption Bill, 2009, on 23 January last, it was also considered necessary to ensure that both the content of any such agreement and its implementation would meet the minimum standards set out in that Bill and under the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">Article 25 of the former agreement between Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam stipulated that the agreement would be automatically extended for a further five-year term unless one state notified the other state to the contrary six months before the expiry of the agreement on 1 May, 2009.  The Government decided that, given the changes to Irish adoption legislation being introduced by the Adoption Bill, the agreement could not be allowed to ‘roll over' in its present form for another five years.  As a result, the Government was obliged to formally notify the Vietnamese authorities of the fact that there could be no automatic renewal of the agreement when its five-year term came to a close.  This formal notification, made via Third Party Note (TPN) No. 185, was conveyed through diplomatic channels to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 30 October 2008, on foot of the Government Decision of 29 October, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3248">As the Deputies are undoubtedly aware, I have just returned from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, where I met with the Vietnamese Minister for Justice on 30 June last to discuss international adoption issues.  There were follow-up discussions on these issues with the Standing Vice-Minister at the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and with the newly appointed Director of the Vietnamese Department of Adoptions and his deputy, as well as a number of informal meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3249">During the discussions, careful consideration was given to possible interim arrangements for inter-country adoptions between both jurisdictions.  The Vietnamese side clarified that their legal requirements were such that this was not considered to be an appropriate option.  Therefore, it was proposed to continue the focus on a new bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3250">I would like to again reiterate the point that both countries remain firmly committed to concluding a new bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement.  Work on the draft text of a new agreement, which was previously circulated in March of this year and discussed the following month, is continuing.  Good progress has been made in the past week and, during the course of the talks in Hanoi, it was agreed that further face-to-face discussions to resolve outstanding issues should take place in August.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">However, it is still not possible for me to either give a precise timetable to the House or anticipate when the discussions with the Vietnamese Government on a new bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement and associated matters will be concluded.  The negotiations remain live and officials from my Office, from the Office of the Attorney General, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and from the Adoption Board are working on all outstanding issues with a view to preparing a final text for a new agreement as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">I am acutely aware of the stress and anxiety that this process has caused to many prospective adoptive parents.  I am given to understand that, at present, approximately 360 couples have registered with the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency and are hoping to adopt from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">I can assure the Deputies that work regarding a new bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam continues to be given the very highest priority by my Office.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3257">I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 188 and 191 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">As the Deputies are aware, the Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on 23 January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3259">Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention as well as from those countries with which Ireland has a bi-lateral agreement based on Hague standards.  As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries who continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care that cannot be provided domestically.  We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreements with a small number of countries, including with the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">Ireland has no official bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement in place with the Russian Federation.  However, preparatory work to consider the contents of a draft agreement with the Russian authorities is currently being undertaken.  Officials in both my Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs have been taking soundings in relation to inter-country adoption in the Russian Federation since April 2008.  This has included contacts with the Irish Embassy in Moscow and legal and other preparatory work on the possibility of a draft bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement between the two countries.  A first formal meeting, arranged with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, was held on 7 May, 2009, between officials from my Office and from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland.  I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of my colleague Minister Martin and of his officials in both Dublin and Moscow.</p>
            <p eId="para_3261">While every effort will be made to conclude a bi-lateral inter-country Adoption Agreement with the Russian Federation, it must be acknowledged that this matter will be determined to a considerable degree by the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3262">With regard to the issue of post-placement reports, an extensive examination of the list of alleged "missing" post-placement reports has been carried out by the Health Service Executive and the Adoption Board.  While I await the final numbers, which are expected shortly, it appears that the list supplied by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science is inaccurate.  In short, the majority of the outstanding reports (which are estimated to be around 30) have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation — that is, the Social Workers have already conducted the home visit and the report.  In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their Social Worker.  Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">1,229 children from the Russian Federation have had their names entered into the Register of Foreign Adoptions in the period between 1991 and 2008.  This equates to approximately 5,000 post-placement reports.  Of the total number of reports required, just over one half of one per cent have not been transmitted to the Russian authorities.  Despite the current difficulties, I believe that these statistics make it clear that the vast majority of parents are complying with the commitment that they gave to co-operate with such reports and, also, that they are being fully assisted in doing so by the Health Service Executive and the Adoption Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">Officials have indicated to the Russian side the importance that we are attaching to resolving the matter.  Once finalised, the Adoption Board has advised that it will contact the Russian authorities with the validated list.  The Health Service Executive and the Adoption Board have already contacted any families where reports are outstanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">I acknowledge that persons applying for inter-country adoption are experiencing delays with regard to waiting times for assessment and am also acutely aware of the stress and anxiety that this process has caused to many prospective adoptive parents.  The Adoption Bill, which has now passed all stages in the Seanad, provides for an updated and more standardised regime of assessment and mediation services across the country that will assist in the reduction of waiting times in areas where these are longest.</p>

            <p eId="para_3269">Currently, an administrative arrangement operates between Ireland and the Chinese Government with regard to adoption.  The People's Republic of China is a contracting State under the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption and, as such, a bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement is not, and will not, be required between both jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3275">The 2009 budget allocation for youth work services is over €48 million, a decrease of some 8% on the 2008 figure.  In light of budgetary constraints it is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget will continue to focus on supporting existing programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities.

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_575">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3280">I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 283 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) which was announced recently by the Minister of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3282">The scheme will allow children to avail of a free playschool place in their pre-school year, which will be provided for three hours per day, five days per week for 38 weeks.  It will also allow children in their pre-school year who are attending a full or part-time daycare service to avail of a free session of two hours and 15 minutes per day, five days per week for 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010 and children availing of the scheme in January 2010 will have a reduced period of free pre-school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">The age at which children commence primary school varies depending on a number of factors and, for this reason, the scheme provides for a 15 month age range for eligibility.  The number of children who avail of the scheme in January 2010 could, therefore, exceed the number of children who would be expected to commence primary school in September 2010.  However, this is not expected to be the case and it is estimated that the maximum number of children who will avail of the scheme in January 2010 will be 65,000.  This figure takes account of data sources including the live births register, the 2006 census of population and the number of enrolments in junior infant classes in recent years.  For a number of reasons, in particular those outlined below, it is anticipated that the actual take-up of places under the scheme in January 2010, will not amount to the full cohort of 65,000 and will be closer to 60,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3284">Up to 3,000 children are expected to continue to avail of pre-school provision within full and part-time pre-school services supported under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).  The CCSS provides significant support funding for disadvantaged parents using community childcare services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3285">International experience suggests that, it can take some time to achieve a full participation rate when schemes of this type are introduced.  Assuming a high participation rate of 95% in the first year, rather than a 100% participation rate, would further reduce the anticipated demand for places in January 2010 by some 3,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3286">As is the case with fee-paying primary schools a  minority of parents may choose to send their children to pre-school services which opt to remain outside the ECCE scheme.   Assuming the number of children attending such pre-schools will mirror the number at children entering private primary schools,  the demand for places will be reduced by a further 1,000 places.</p>
            <p eId="para_3287">Given the rise in the birth rate between 2005 and 2008, the number of places required under the scheme is expected to increase in September 2010 and during 2011-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3288">Applications to the scheme are made, in the first instance, to the 33 City-County Childcare Committees (CCCs).  Over the course of the last three weeks, the CCCs have provided weekly returns to my Office of the numbers of applications received.  These show the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_3289">19 June: 4,517 places;</p>
            <p eId="para_3290">26 June: 19,253 places;</p>
            <p eId="para_3291">3 July: 1,033 places.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">Past experience suggests that many applications are made in the week prior to the closing date for acceptance.  While the closing date for applications is 10 July, late applications will be considered where good cause for the late application is demonstrated.  However, as some counties already show a supply of places which exceeds the expected demand, in these counties late applications will  be accepted on an exceptional basis only.  Based on the rate of applications to date, I am confident that the total number of places available in pre-schools applying to enter the scheme will more than meet the number of places required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">From the time of the budget announcement, I have stated clearly that there may be a small number of areas where the demand for places will exceed the supply.  My Office and the CCCs will continue to monitor the situation between now and September 2010 when the first full year of the scheme will take effect and I am confident that the scheme will encourage new pre-school services in areas where a need for additional places is demonstrated.</p>

The HSE believes it is feasible to publish the findings and recommendations in so far as they relate to service development/improvement while at the same time maintaining the right to privacy of children and families. The HSE is developing a framework that will take into account the requirements of publishing the final review reports, implementing the recommendations and applying the learning.

            <p eId="para_3338">As the Deputy is aware, I was informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 12 June last that the Vietnamese licence held by the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency had been revoked by the Vietnamese authorities.  The Government had previously requested that this licence be suspended rather than revoked in light of the on-going discussions with Vietnamese officials on a strengthened bilateral inter-country adoption agreement.  Unfortunately, in the absence of a full agreement between Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Government was not in a position to make any exception to the granting of a licence to Helping Hands.</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">I subsequently advised the representative groups on these developments, and the applicants involved were also contacted by Helping Hands.  Despite these events, I must emphasise that all of the applicants who have already received a referral in respect of a child from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam will have their applications processed to conclusion, and applicants will be supported by Helping Hands in that process, by agreement with the Vietnamese authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and the decisions that it makes regarding the internal regulation and management of its adoption services must be treated sensitively as appropriate to a sovereign state.</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">The reinstatement of the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency's licence would be a necessary part of any new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  I can assure the Deputy that the work to prepare for and advise the Government on a strengthened bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has been given, and continues to be given, the very highest priority by my Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_3344">Children will be eligible to avail of the scheme if they are aged between three years three months and four years six months on 1 September each year.  Those entering the scheme in January 2010 will be eligible if they are aged between three years seven months and four years ten months at that time.  Exceptions to the upper age limit will be allowed where children are assessed by the HSE to have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">As the Deputy notes, most but not all children commence primary school at around five years of age.  The provision of a 15 month age range for eligibility is designed to give flexibility to parents to access the scheme at the most appropriate time for their children prior to commencing school and the majority of children who participate in the scheme would be expected to commence primary school between the age of four years three months and five years six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_3356">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the sponsorship scheme which provides for public health service employees to train as nurses.  This scheme was introduced in 2002 on commencement of the undergraduate nursing degree programme.</p>

Under the scheme employees who successfully apply for sponsorship are allowed to retain their existing salaries throughout the four years of the degree programme in return for a commitment to work as nurses for their employer for a period of five years following registration.</p>

The findings of the review will provide a basis to inform decision makers on the future direction of undergraduate nursing education in Ireland.</p>

There can be no grounds for causing upset or anxiety about the supply of prescriptions to patients.

            <p eId="para_3403">The decisions I have made on the reduction in payments to community pharmacists under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 will reduce their income from the Health Service Executive (HSE) by €133m in a full year, from a total of approximately €550m.  This is a reduction of 24% and not 34% as representatives of the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) have claimed.  My decisions followed a public consultation process conducted under that Act.  All interested stakeholders were invited to make submissions on the matter.  The IPU made both a written and an oral submission to my Department.  In addition, 104 other written submissions were received largely from community pharmacists.  These submissions were analysed and considered before I made my decision to reduce payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">Reductions are absolutely necessary for two reasons.  Firstly, the cost of the community drugs schemes has doubled since 2002 to over €1.6 billion in 2008: and fees and other income earned by pharmacists have doubled accordingly.  Secondly, it cost an exorbitant €640 million to get €1 billion of drugs from the factory gate to the patient in the community in 2008.  This level of expenditure on delivery and dispensing is no longer sustainable, given the current financial circumstances of the country and the other priorities for spending in the health sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">Savings from the measures have been estimated at €55 million for the remainder of this year and €133 million on a full year basis.  This is almost exactly what would have been saved if I had imposed an across the board 8% reduction in fees and retail mark-ups and re-imposed the reduction in wholesale mark-up to 8%, as attempted by the HSE last year.  However, I have decided to achieve broadly the same level of reduction through a revised common fee structure for dispensing, a reduced retail mark-up, removal of the special payment for over-70s dispensing and reduction in the wholesale mark-up to 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3406">In its submissions, the IPU indicated that it was prepared to consider yielding savings in an amount equivalent to 8% of dispensing fees only, which it calculated would save €21m in a full year.  This would imply that their earnings from the HSE were just €260m in 2008.  However, this is far from the case.  In addition to dispensing fees, pharmacists also received a retail mark-up of 50% on items dispensed under the Drug Payments and Long Term Illness Schemes and special payments in respect of dispensing to persons aged 70 years and over.  These payments brought their income from the HSE in 2008 to €440m.  In addition pharmacists have benefitted from approximately half the €200m value of the wholesale margin.  For the reasons outlined earlier, savings of €21m as proposed by the IPU would not have been an adequate response to the financial problems that we face in the pharmacy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3407">The IPU also suggested that savings of €30m could be obtained through generic substitution and €33.7m through a combination of changes in the High Tech Scheme, implementation of the Barry Report and the IPHA agreement.  These are matters that are being pursued by my Department and the HSE.  Any savings that arise under these headings will be additional to, and not a substitution for, the reductions in payments to pharmacists that I have announced.</p>

Information on the extent and timing of commitments already entered into is being updated as part of this review process.  It is clear at this stage that expenditure in 2009 will need to be managed carefully within the available limits and that further commitments will require prioritisation within the expected funding envelope for future years.  When the review is completed, the Executive is required to submit its proposed capital investment programme for my approval with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  Details of the individual projects being included in the capital plan will be made available when the plan is approved.</p>

When the wholesale mark-up was 17.66% a pharmacist would have received €100 for a drug with an ex-factory price of €85.  With a 10% wholesale mark-up, the pharmacist will receive €93.50 for the same drug at the same ex-factory price, yielding a saving to the State of €6.50. The total expected full year savings from this measure are €77 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3647">I might also mention that my Department and the HSE concluded agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI), representing the proprietary and generic manufacturers respectively,  in mid-2006. As a result of these agreements there have been reductions, totalling 35%, in the price of a range of off-patent drugs and medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_3648">A report published by the National Centre for Pharmaco-economics in May 2009 has estimated that a total of €248.5 million will be saved due to off-patent price cuts, up to August 2010, when the agreements come up for renewal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">My Department and the HSE are continuing to examine all aspects of pharmaceutical expenditure with a view to containing costs. Among the matters which continue to be kept under review are the price of drugs (including generic and off-patent drugs), the volume of drugs prescribed, more cost effective prescribing by GPs and the greater use of generic medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">Under the measures mentioned above, the State is setting a price at which it pays for drugs, ingredient and distribution costs. It is not setting the price which any party in the supply chain — manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacists, may charge for drugs sold which are not reimbursed by the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_3681">Significant progress has been made in advancing individual co-location projects.  The Board of the HSE  has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at Beaumont, Cork University Hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick, St. James's, Waterford Regional and Sligo General Hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3682">Project Agreements for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James's projects have been signed.  Planning permission has been granted for the first three of these projects.  A planning application has been submitted in respect of the St James's project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3683">The necessary preparatory work for the Project Agreements in respect of Waterford Regional Hospital and Sligo General Hospital is proceeding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3684">Two further projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3685">It is the responsibility of the successful bidders to arrange the financing of the projects.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance projects in the context of the challenging financial environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">It is an essential requirement that each co-location project demonstrates clear value for money to the taxpayer. The Finance Act 2009 provides that the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities will be terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development.  Provided that a co-located private hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure. I do not accept that, relative to its value, a high proportion of tax would be forgone by the Exchequer in respect of co-location projects as additional revenues would accrue to the Exchequer from the extra activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment arising and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">As regards the costs incurred by the HSE on its legal and other expenses in respect of the co-location initiative, there is a requirement on each of the preferred bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement. The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_3688">The HSE estimates that, from the start of building, the overall construction and commissioning period for the projects will be about 28 to 36 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_3703">The Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists in 2006 made recommendations on strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists. The Report of the National Working Group outlined guidance for professional associations and provided examples of codes of ethics and good practice, including grievance and disciplinary procedures. To support the development of robust voluntary self-regulation, my Department has facilitated the provision of work days to facilitate different therapies to come together to undertake a process of harmonisation and development with regard to common basic standards of practice, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_3704">Among the recommendations contained in the Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists was that the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) take a role in the accreditation of programmes of higher education and training for complementary therapists. HETAC has now determined and published a set of standards for complementary therapies to be used in the accreditation of any programmes submitted by providers of education and training in complementary therapies. These standards will be a valuable tool in the accreditation of relevant education and training programmes. In adopting these standards, HETAC has identified a requirement that each programme within a therapy should only be validated when there is federation into one representative organisation for that therapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3705">Federation of individual professional therapy associations into one representative organisation for that therapy is a key component required for the development of common standards of education and training for complementary therapies. This approach is essential to ensure harmonisation of standards and to eliminate variations in standards of education and training or codes of practice within each complementary therapy discipline. The complementary therapy sector is currently engaged in forming the solid frameworks and federations with which to link and to govern the sector, and it is hoped that further progress in this area can be achieved over time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3787">The report, referred to by the Deputy, relates to the experiences of clients of the Crosscare service when interacting with the Irish immigration system.  It is a lengthy report with many comments and over 90 recommendations. As a result it is not possible for me to comment in detail on the issues raised but rather to give a general response.</p>
            <p eId="para_3788">There is no doubt as to the sincerity of the Report and any commentary on the operation of the Immigration system, or indeed of any State service, is worthwhile. That is not to say that I would accept its findings or analysis in each area.  The Report approaches the issue from the migrant perspective, somewhat in isolation from broader policy considerations and without significant consideration of resource constraints. Government on the other hand has to take a broader view balancing sometimes conflicting demands.</p>
            <p eId="para_3789">The Report highlights general issues of customer service and lack of information. These comments are noted. Neither I as Minister nor the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service would claim that there is no room for improvement. On the contrary, efforts to improve the service are ongoing and INIS is implementing a change management programme aimed at managing its enormous and changing workload into the future. The Crosscare report will input into that change management process. INIS has also established a customer forum, chaired by its head of Corporate Services, at which NGOs, including Crosscare, have the opportunity to meet with senior personnel and raise issues of concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_3790">The Report is critical of the level of discretion in the decision making process.  While the need for transparency and consistency is accepted, ultimately decisions have to be made by the State authorities based on best judgement and with reference to the circumstances presented in a particular case. Each case must be determined on its merits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3791">In relation to persons who become undocumented, it does not follow that this is the result of State inaction. First and foremost all migrants have a responsibility to maintain their immigration permission. Many of the  people who enter into correspondence with the immigration authorities or make an application for leave to remain have no immigration status at the time they do so.  Arrangements are being put in place to deal with cases where persons who formerly held a work permit have become undocumented through no fault of their own.</p>

            <p eId="para_3795">While it is not possible to estimate the overall extent to which heroin use is a factor in crime, what is clear from available studies and research is that the provision of drug treatment in general substantially reduces drug use and related involvement in crime.  The recently published Rosie Study by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (available at www.nacd.ie) which measured drug treatment outcomes demonstrates this clearly in the Irish context.</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">Overall the Government's approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse, including heroin use, is through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under our National Drugs Strategy which tackles the issue under pillar headings of drugs supply reduction, education and prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  This Department's involvement is primarily (although not solely) concerned with the drug supply reduction pillar.</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">With regard to measures in place to tackle drug crime, An Garda Síochána undertakes a number of multi-agency actions designed to target the activities of criminal organisations involved in the sale and supply of illicit drugs, including: conducting targeted operations against individual and organisation operating within this jurisdiction with known links to international criminals, including Irish nationals based abroad; continued co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Service) under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding in the proactive investigation of persons suspected of being involved in international drug-trafficking; exchanging strategic and operational intelligence with other law enforcement agencies, including Interpol and Europol, in accordance with legislation and operational protocols; and assisting international law enforcement agencies who are conducting investigations with suspected involvement by Irish nationals, through the Mutual Assistance Agreement in criminal matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_3798">As the Deputy will appreciate, the provision of addiction treatment is a matter for the Department of Health and Children and the Health Services Executive.  I am advised that there are no up-to-date statistics on heroin use in the population. A special capture recapture study done in 2002 provided an estimate of 14,500 heroin users.  A similar type study is currently underway under the auspices of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs.  Nationally there were 8,794 clients on the Central Treatment List for methadone maintenance at the end of March 2009. I am advised that eleven of these clients were registered on the Central Treatment List with addresses in the South Tipperary /Local Health Office Area.  I am informed that there were no under 18's on methadone maintenance treatment or awaiting methadone maintenance treatment during the above periods.</p>

            <p eId="para_3806">The Garda Policing Plan for 2009, which reflects the priorities set for the Force by me as Minister, includes a number of strategic actions aimed at significantly reducing the incidence of crime and criminal behaviour.  These include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_3807">One of these operations is Operation Anvil, the primary focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation has resulted in the seizure of over 2,500 firearms and the recovery of stolen property worth almost €32.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3808">The Garda Commissioner has established the Organised Crime Unit with the specific objective of targeting those suspected of involvement in organised crime.  It works in association with other specialised units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  To date the Unit has participated in numerous intelligence-led operations.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 will further enhance the capabilities of An Garda Síochána to develop strategies to prevent, detect and reduce the opportunities for violent crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_3809">Local Garda management closely monitors crime trends and puts strategies in place to prevent, detect and reduce the number of incidences of the type of crime referred to.  Divisional Scene of Crime Units provide a flexible and immediate response to emerging crime issues and assist in identifying and monitoring crime trends as they are emerging.  Injured parties are offered crime prevention and personal security advice by members of An Garda Síochána attending the scenes of such crimes.  The Divisional Crime Prevention Officer can also be requested to attend at the scene and conduct a security audit, providing specific crime prevention or personal security advice, depending on the circumstances of the individual or business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3810">Members of the local Community Policing Unit and local Garda management liaise with local communities and provide crime prevention advice to the community, including older members.  Community Gardaí attend regular meetings with residents and any issues raised are pursued.  An Garda Síochána have organised a number of Community Safety Weeks, which included a series of high profile crime prevention and reduction initiatives nationally, in addition to initiatives by local community Gardaí and Garda Crime Prevention Officers.  During these Weeks, An Garda Síochána emphasise how householders and residents can make their homes safer and more secure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3811">Community Alert, which my Department has supported on an ongoing basis, places particular emphasis on its volunteers visiting older and more vulnerable people in their community and offering their assistance in enabling such people to increase their security.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_3814">More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_3834">If an asylum application has been made in respect of the first named person, the Deputy should note that it is not the practice to comment on asylum applications that are pending.</p>
            <p eId="para_3835">The second named person arrived in the State on 23 November, 2007 and applied for asylum. On 5 December, 2007 she gave birth to a daughter, the third named person, and included her in her asylum application. Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3836">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the second person was informed, by letter dated 22 September, 2008, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her daughter. The person concerned and her daughter were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, i.e. why they should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_3837">She was also notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. By correspondence dated 10 October, 2008, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the second named person by her legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The second named person and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 26 January, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3838">Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 as amended, on the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 4 February, 2009, I refused the person concerned permission to remain temporarily in the State and signed Deportation Orders in respect of her and her daughter. Notice of these orders was served by registered post requiring the person concerned and her daughter to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Monday 23 February, 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for their removal from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3839">By letter dated 2 February, 2009, representations were received from the legal representative of the second named person seeking re — consideration of the refusal of the application for temporary leave to remain in the State. The representations received were considered as an application pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, seeking the revocation of the Deportation Order of the person concerned. Following consideration of the information submitted, the Deportation Order was affirmed and the second named person was notified of this decision by letter dated 23 February, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3840">On 23 February, 2009 Judicial Review proceedings were instituted seeking leave to challenge the Deportation Orders. Leave to apply was refused in the High Court on 17 June, 2009.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the second named person and her daughter for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all <i>refoulement</i> issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport them is justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_3841">The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the second named person and her daughter must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Orders is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

            <p eId="para_3847">The number of persons currently imprisoned for the non-payment of a fine by the due date is 6.  This represents a tiny fraction of 0.2% of the overall prison population.  The numbers have always been on the low side and there is no discernible upward trend.</p>
            <p eId="para_3848">On 20th April 2009 I published the Fines Bill 2009. The Bill, which was referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights on 14th May 2009,  provides that where a court imposes a fine on a person, that person may apply to the court to pay the fine by instalments. If the court is satisfied that paying the fine in full by the due date would result in undue financial hardship for that person or his or her dependants, it can direct that the fine be paid by instalments over the period of a year. An extension of up to a year may also be given by the court where it is satisfied that the financial circumstances of the person have changed and that the change is not due to the person's culpable neglect.</p>
            <p eId="para_3849">The Bill also provides the courts with three new options where a fine has not been paid by the due date. These are the appointment of a receiver, where the fine was imposed following conviction on indictment, recovery of the fine as if it was a civil debt and the imposition of a community service order.</p>

            <p eId="para_3877">The person concerned applied for asylum on 23 July 2004.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned initiated Judicial Review proceedings, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in his case.  The High Court refused the Judicial Review leave application with the consequence that the earlier decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal decision stood.</p>
            <p eId="para_3878">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 8 July 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_3879">In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file is passed to me for decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_3922">The 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provides a mechanism whereby prisoners can be repatriated to their home state in order to serve prison sentences they have incurred abroad.

            <p eId="para_3923">The process requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between the relevant jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and their continued detention here.</p>

My officials have contacted the UK authorities responsible for such repatriations regarding this matter and they have stated that they have not received an application from the person concerned either.  If he has not already done so, he should now apply for a transfer via his Prison Governor in the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p eId="para_3926">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  I believe that these provisions have made a significant contribution to addressing anti-social behaviour. Nevertheless, I believe that it is appropriate at this stage to review the operation of the legislation to see whether any improvements can be made, and in this regard my Department is in consultation with the Garda authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3927">The Garda Policing Plan for 2009, which reflects the priorities set for the Force by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour. One of the strategic goals identified in the Plan is to reduce significantly the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3928">Joint Policing Committees provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and the local authority — the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area — can come together, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting the area.  A Committee has a range of functions and monitor two broad areas. The first is the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in its area, including patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs. The second is the broader issue of the factors underlying and contributing to crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Following on from this the Committee advises the local authority and An Garda Síochána on how they might best perform their functions, having regard to the need to do everything feasible to improve the safety and quality of life and to prevent crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3929">I am of the view that the Committees have enormous potential for tackling the problems of anti-social behaviour.</p>

            <p eId="para_3938">To avail of a payment under the Scheme, an application was required to have been made during the term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission. The Commission's term of appointment came to an end on 31 October 2008 and no further payments can therefore be made. However, as I have previously stated to the House, the long-term medical expenses of survivors of incidents in this jurisdiction arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for.</p>
            <p eId="para_3939">In relation to support services, the Deputy will be aware of the organisation Justice for the Forgotten, to which my Department has previously provided funding. I am also aware, from my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Department of Foreign Affairs provides funding to a number of Irish societies and organisations in the Birmingham area which work with and support the Irish community there. That Department can no doubt provide the Deputy with details of these organisations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3943">There is a specific statutory offence of intimidation of members of a jury.  Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it an offence to harm or threaten or in any other way intimidate or put in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation by An Garda Síochána of an offence, or is a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence, or a member of his or her family, with the intention thereby of causing the investigation or the course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.</p>
            <p eId="para_3944">I am informed by the Garda authorities that separate records are not maintained of offences under section 41 as between those directed against witnesses and those directed against jurors.  Accordingly, the information available from the Gardaí covers both categories of individuals. The Deputy will appreciate that, of their nature, instances of intimidation of jurors are less likely to come to notice than instances of witness intimidation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3982">The letter the Deputy is referring to was issued to the person concerned on 22 June 2009 informing him that his temporary leave to remain in the State had been extended by one year.  This temporary leave to remain in the State is granted under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  As part of assessing all cases, including renewals, under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), consideration must be given to eleven factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended); one of which is, Section 3(6) (g), the character and conduct of the person both within and (where relevant and ascertainable) outside the State (including any criminal convictions).  In this regard, as is standard procedure, a Garda report was sought in relation to the person concerned during examination of his application for renewal of temporary leave to remain.  The Garda report received indicated that the person concerned was convicted in Cork City Court of a number of driving offences.  Notwithstanding this information, it was decided to renew the temporary leave to remain in the State.  As is standard procedure in such cases, the letter notifying the person concerned of this decision also cautioned him that the renewal of his leave to remain was conditional to him obeying the laws of the State and that he should not involve himself in any further criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3983">However, subsequent to the issuing of this letter, further information was received from the person concerned on 27 June 2009, which indicated that the convictions against him had been overturned on appeal.  Following receipt of this information, a further Garda report was sought on the matter.  The Garda report confirmed the appeal outcome. In light of this information the person concerned was issued with a new temporary permission to remain letter on 6 June 2009, in which all references to the driving offences have been removed.</p>

        <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the reason for the approximate two month delay between the time a naturalisation application is referred to him for a decision and the decision being made and notified to the applicant; the procedures taken when an application is referred to him for a decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_727">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4007">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  There are currently over 16,000 applications for naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of this Department that are still awaiting a decision. This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years. In 2002 there were 3,500 applications whereas in 2008, the number of such applications was 10,885. This upward trend seems set to continue and it is anticipated that applications for naturalisation will increase to over 15,000 in the present year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">Recently, substantial increased resources have been made available to this Department in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants.  This has also had a positive impact on processing times. The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for certificates of naturalisation is now at twenty three months. The Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in early 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4009">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks and the time taken waiting for resources to become available to perform those checks. In practice, a necessary period of time elapses while files that are finished processing have submissions prepared, those submissions are batched for transmission to the Minister's Office, decided upon and batched for return to Citizenship Division for the issuing of decision letters.</p>
            <p eId="para_4010">I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that a certificate of naturalisation is an exceptional and important document that facilitates a non-national becoming a citizen of Ireland. Therefore, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved, as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of Citizenship is not undervalued, and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved have been developed and refined over a number of years and the Minister is satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4011">The increased resources that have been allocated to this area have resulted in a considerable improvement in processing times over the past year, even though the number of applications for a certificate of naturalisation has continued to see significant growth. However, as I have pointed out, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_4095">The Report to which the Deputy refers outlines in a broad sense the threat associated with organised crime engaging in fraudulent activities associated with the visa regime. There are also specific references to the potential for student immigration in the United Kingdom and Ireland to be exploited by organised crime whether through false documentation or the establishment of bogus schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4096">The Irish immigration authorities in the course of their day to day operational activities, including the processing of visas, maintain a vigilant watch so as to identify fraudulent practices and documentation.  Where activities in a particular sector give rise to a suspicion of irregular activity the matter may be further investigated by the immigration section within my own Department or, depending on the activity, may be referred to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Arising from such investigations a number of actions may be taken by the immigration authorities depending on the extent of the identified irregular activities.  Clearly the immigration authorities have to be alert to potential abuse when administering the visa system. Visa applications are frequently rejected on the grounds fraudulent documents or general lack of credibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_4097">The Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently engaged in a review of the immigration regime for full time non-EEA students. The purpose of the review is two fold. First, there is a need for greater coherence in the way we deal with non-EEA students via a transparent system that is consistent with Irish immigration policy generally. Secondly, it is generally accepted that there is a need for greater regulation in the student area.  This will be beneficial both in curbing abuses and in assisting the future development and marketing of the sector on a solid foundation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4098">The Deputy will appreciate that the policing of this area is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I can however inform the Deputy that a report on the matters referred to in the Report has now been sought from the Garda Commissioner.</p>

In certain circumstances, however, where prisoners are approaching the end of their periods of detention and there has been consultation between the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Irish Prison Service and officials in my Department, foreign nationals subject to Deportation Orders may be removed from the State in accordance with Immigration law. The enforcement of Deportation Orders is an operational matter for the Bureau.</p>

            <p eId="para_4170">In the past five years my Department has taken one court case. This case was taken in 2005, in Stockholm, against a planning permission which had been granted to develop the attic space of a building, which contained an Embassy property owned by the State. The Department initiated an appeal against this planning permission to the Stockholm Rent Tribunal (part of the Swedish court system). The Rent Tribunal upheld the initial planning permission and, on the basis of legal advice from the Embassy lawyers at the time, it was decided not to appeal this ruling.  The legal costs associated with the appeal, including legal advice received on the implications of the ruling, amounted to €11,377.</p>

            <p eId="para_4172">The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States.  We have emphasised our strong support for the undocumented in all our engagements with the US Administration and Congress, including during meetings with President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton in Washington this March. The Taoiseach and I held extensive discussions on the issue with the Congressional delegation, led by Congressman Neal, which visited Ireland last week. This included particularly useful exchanges with influential legislators, Congressman Luis Gutierrez and Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, both strong proponents of comprehensive immigration reform and leading members of the Hispanic Caucus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4173">As the Deputy is aware, in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, the Government has been actively pursuing a bilateral approach, aimed at facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries. The approach has had three core objectives: a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement (now operational); new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term E3 working visas; and a solution for our undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_4174">While the inclusion of Ireland in an expanded version of the E3 programme would provide extensive new opportunities for Irish people to work in the United States and help ensure that a new generation of undocumented Irish does not develop, our friends on Capitol Hill have been clear that the status of the undocumented Irish cannot be addressed in isolation from other ethnic groups, including by way of an E3. Their advice is that the best prospect for a solution for the undocumented continues to lie with comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_4175">On 25 June, President Obama met with a range of key Congressional figures, including supporters and opponents of reform, to discuss this issue and identify how to begin fixing what he has described as a broken immigration system. His statement following the meeting that his ‘Administration is fully behind an effort to achieve comprehensive immigration reform' is very welcome. I also note the announcement that the Administration, under the direction of Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, will work with a leadership group from Congress to take forward the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4176">As President Obama noted, however, immigration remains ‘a sensitive and politically volatile issue' in the United States. Bi-partisan support is considered vital to the success of comprehensive reform and our friends on Capitol Hill, including those within the visiting delegation, have made it clear that progressing legislation will continue to present significant challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_4177">While encouraged by recent developments, the immediate prospects for immigration reform remain uncertain. The Government is determined to continue to highlight the difficulties facing our undocumented citizens and to support the Administration in its efforts to implement reform.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4179">The formation of a unity government in Zimbabwe in February was far from being a solution to Zimbabwe's problems, but was nonetheless a sign of some limited progress in the political process. Five months on, despite some improvements in the situation on the ground in Zimbabwe, notably in curbing hyperinflation and adopting the South African rand as the reference currency, the political situation remains very fragile. I am gravely concerned by reports of continuing human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, torture of prisoners and abuse of the rule of law. The lack of real progress on many issues vital to Zimbabwe's recovery and the failure to reform media laws to allow for meaningful press freedom are causes of ongoing concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_4180">A particular concern is the continued failure of President Mugabe to address the issue of senior government appointments in a manner consistent with the September 2008 power-sharing agreement. The retention of Gideon Gono as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is detrimental to the interests of the country and his removal is vital to build confidence among international donors and investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4181">The international community has stated its willingness to support the economic and social recovery of Zimbabwe. The Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Morgan Tsvangirai, visited Europe and the United States last month to encourage international re-engagement with Zimbabwe at a political and economic level and support for the power-sharing government. The international leaders he met stated clearly their support for the agenda of reform and democratisation and for implementation of the power-sharing agreement, and their willingness to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. Re-engagement remains conditional on the agreed goals set out in the power-sharing agreement being met. These include full access to humanitarian assistance, restoration of the rule of law, commitment to the democratic process, respect for human rights and commitment to macroeconomic stabilisation.  Ireland has worked closely with our EU partners in developing a consistent approach to Zimbabwe. Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor the situation, and maintain contacts with key African partners, including the African Union and the Southern African Development Community. It is clear that Zimbabwe's neighbours have a critical role to play in encouraging reform, and can bring the greatest influence to bear in achieving progress in implementing the power sharing agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4182">In keeping with other international donors, Ireland does not provide funding to the Zimbabwean government, but responds to the humanitarian needs of the Zimbabwean people through support for the work of multilateral and non-governmental organisations. Thus far in 2009, Ireland has committed funding of over €5 million to a range of humanitarian programmes in Zimbabwe, focussed on food security, tackling HIV and AIDS and supporting civil society organisations providing essential services for the population. We have repeatedly stated our willingness to re-engage with a Zimbabwean government which returns to respect for human rights, the rule of law and sound economic management.</p>
            <p eId="para_4183">It is vital for the future of Zimbabwe that the unity government delivers on the promise of reform, and secures for Zimbabwe's people real political freedoms, a return to the rule of law and economic development. Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the international community to encourage progress in these areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_4185">In the past three years my Department has rented office space in one building in Dublin, the ground floor of Hospitality House, Cumberland Street, Dublin 2 at a cost of €144,900 per annum. All other rent commitments relating to properties in the State occupied by the Department of Foreign Affairs are discharged by the Office of Public Works.</p>

            <p eId="para_4187">Rental agreements vary from country to country in accordance with local law and practice. Leases are usually for a fixed period and many include a rent review clause.

            <p eId="para_4188">Rent levels abroad are reviewed each year.

            <p eId="para_4190">I was very concerned to learn of the Israeli naval seizure of the Gaza-bound <i>Spirit of Humanity</i> on 30 June and the arrest and detention of the two Irish citizens — Mairead Maguire and Derek Graham — on board the vessel. The priority for my Department has been to ensure the safety and well-being of Ms. Maguire and Mr. Graham and to secure their prompt release. To that end, we have been in ongoing contact at a senior level with the Israeli authorities, both through the Israeli Embassy here and our own Embassy in Tel Aviv. </p>
            <p eId="para_4191">Ms. Maguire and Mr. Graham have been held in a detention facility in the city of Lod in Israel. An official from our Embassy in Tel Aviv visited them on both 1 and 2 July to check on their well-being and ascertain the conditions of their detention. The Embassy also maintained regular contact with the families and lawyer representing Ms Maguire and Mr. Graham. The Embassy confirmed that Ms. Maguire and Mr. Graham were being treated properly and that the facility at which they were held was satisfactory. I understand that both are expected to be deported from Israel today, and should arrive back in Ireland later this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_4192">The sole purpose of the <i>Spirit of Humanity</i>’s voyage was to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. I would urge the Israeli authorities to now ensure that all humanitarian supplies on board the ship are made available to the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4193">I have been consistent in my condemnation of the economic blockade imposed by Israel upon the Gaza Strip since the summer of 2007, which I regard as amounting to a collective punishment of the people of Gaza. I have emphasised, in discussions with my EU colleagues and directly to Israeli Ministers, my view that the blockade should be brought to an end immediately, and the crossing points opened without restrictions on the normal movement of persons and goods. This is not only vital to allow the dire humanitarian situation in the territory to be addressed, but also so that the long overdue reconstruction of Gaza can begin.</p>
            <p eId="para_4194">My Department's official advice to any persons wishing to travel to Gaza is not to travel at present, in view of the current dangerous and fragile security situation in the Gaza Strip. This advice was communicated to the Free Gaza movement which organised this particular voyage in advance of its sailing.</p>

I understand that the current holders of these contracts are Irish-based companies. These contracts are also used to source routine items (such as headed stationery) for the Department's Missions overseas.

Irish print service providers are of course equally entitled to compete for such contracts in all EU/EEA Member-States. In order to assist and encourage Irish companies to compete for this business, my Department has posted information on accessing public sector market opportunities in the EU/EEA in a section of its website which provides information on public procurement opportunities for suppliers (It can be found at http://dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=28436 .)</p>

            <p eId="para_4251">The introduction of the biometric or e-passport on 16 October, 2006 has greatly enhanced the security features of the Irish passport. The microchip in the passport contains a digital image of the holder which cannot be altered. Any attempt to alter the data on the microchip will be apparent when the passport is read at a border control station because of the added security on the chip.</p>
            <p eId="para_4252">The Passports Act 2008 also introduced a series of new offences relating to the misuse of passports and passport fraud.</p>
            <p eId="para_4253">The Department draws attention on passport application forms to the fact that a passport is a valuable document and that loss or theft is a serious matter. It recommends in its travel advice that passports should always be kept in a secure place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4254">Serial numbers of all lost, stolen and mislaid passports are reported to Interpol, through An Garda Síochána, on a weekly basis. This information is then circulated to police forces around the world which helps prevent lost or stolen passports being fraudulently used for travel.  Records at Interpol Dublin indicate that some 87 Irish passports listed on the Interpol database as reported lost or stolen were detected at immigration points in 2008. A further 77 instances of such passports being presented arose in the period 1 January to 2 July 2009. The increased frequency of such occurrences is due to an increase in the number of ports and airports carrying out checks against the Interpol database.</p>
            <p eId="para_4255">The majority of such incidents concern circumstances where a person had reported a passport as lost or stolen, obtained a replacement passport, but subsequently recovered the previous passport and continued to use it. These cases are generally resolved quickly through enquiries with the Passport Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_4256">The notes accompanying passport application forms state that persons should not attempt to travel on a passport which has been reported lost or stolen. When completing the statement of loss, applicants undertake not to travel on a missing passport if subsequently found.</p>

            <p eId="para_4443">The Rural Transport Night Scheme was implemented as a pilot project in seven selected areas, including an area in Co. Roscommon.</p>
            <p eId="para_4444">Following discussions between the seven groups that have been operating the pilot and Pobal, who manage both the pilot on behalf of my Department and the Rural Transport Programme on behalf of the Department of Transport, it has been agreed that the groups will continue with some evening services until the end of the year, instead of finishing on 10th July.</p>
            <p eId="para_4445">I have asked that all possible efforts be made to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the transport service, involving increased load capacity, re-tendering to operators to seek cheaper quotes where appropriate and focussing more on generating income from passengers.  It is also intended that, by end year, the seven operating groups, with support from Pobal, will prioritise routes that can be resourced from existing resources, thus sustaining some level of evening services for 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4487">The Family Support Agency funds the Family Mediation Service (FMS), which provides family mediation to separating couples in Ireland.  The FMS is a free, professional, confidential service which enables couples, married and non-married, who have decided to separate, or divorce and who together want to negotiate the terms of their separation or divorce with the help of a trained mediator.  It assists couples to address the issues on which they need to make decisions including: post-separation living arrangements, finances and parenting arrangements to enable children to have an ongoing relationship with each parent.  Some 1,270 couples were assisted in 2008.  Funding for the FMS in 2009 amounts to over €3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4488">The service is run by 21 part-time professional Mediators and their supervisory and part-time administrative support staff.  There are currently 16 FMS centres throughout the country.  Of the 16 centres, 4 are regional offices, open 5 days a week.  The four regions are Eastern, Western, Southern and Mid-western.  The other 12 centres are part-time offices, open 2.5 days per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4489">The FMS has 4 Area Co-ordinator (AC) posts. Each AC has responsibility for 1 regional office and 3 part-time offices.  The AC is responsible for all aspects of the day to day management of the FMS in their region, including staff management, service management and managing finance and facilities.  The AC is part of the FMS Management Team and assists the FMS Service Manager in the overall management of the FMS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4490">Following a Government Decision, no public service vacancy arising with effect from 27 th March 2009 may be filled by recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance.  Neither should any temporary or fixed term contracts be extended or renewed.  Any exceptions to this principle require the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4491">Several vacancies in the FMS occurred from mid-May onwards, most of which were immediate, front-line posts.  Following their consideration of the Family Support Agency's submission, the Department of Finance sanctioned the temporary filling of 6 front-line posts to enable the continuation of the mediation service to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_4492">In June 2009, two AC posts (Southern and Western regions) became vacant.  Sanction has been sought from the Department of Finance for the filling of these posts on a temporary basis.  This would facilitate the Family Support Agency to review its structures and put in place a plan to address the loss of these two posts.  This matter is with the Department of Finance for their consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_4493">The Government's support for families remains strong.  The Family Support Agency has been allocated funding of almost €36 million for 2009.  This includes funding of over €18 million for the Family Resource Centre Programme, supporting 107 FRCs nationwide.  It also includes funding of over €11 million being granted to some 600 voluntary and community organisations providing marriage, relationship, child and bereavement counselling services.</p>

            <p eId="para_4495">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>
            <p eId="para_4496">Rent supplement is intended as a short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are currently almost 90,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 50% since the end of December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4497">The Government approved a package of measures to update minimum standards regulations for rented accommodation early this year.  Enforcement of these standards is the responsibility of local authorities.  The community welfare service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work.  However,accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4498">Under legislative provisions introduced by the Department in 2006 and 2007, the community welfare service can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4499">The community welfare service must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme, is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  In determining whether the accommodation is suited to the person's accommodation needs, a community welfare officer must have regard to the household composition, the size of the accommodation unit and identify any special needs that the person may have.  As part of this process, the community welfare officer would normally carry out a visit to the residential premises in question; this home visit is also used to confirm the applicant's residence at this address.  The number of such visits carried out by a community welfare officer is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">Where a community welfare officer becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appear to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">Details of rent supplement tenancies are provided to local authorities via the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a quarterly basis and this information sharing assists in enforcing housing standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4502">The Department is committed to working with and supporting the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government and local authorities in meeting their responsibilities in relation to the enforcement of housing standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_4510">The live register is complied from returns made for each local office to the Central Statistics Office by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

            <p eId="para_5091">Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Miners who are unable to work due to an accident or illness arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim.  The occupational injuries scheme, operated by the Department, provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5092">Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  If the incapacity extends beyond the 26 week period, claimants may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5093">Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme.  Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work.  Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.</p>

            <p eId="para_5126">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_5127">The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution which a person is expected to contribute towards their rent, be increased by €6 to €24 with effect from 1 June 2009 and that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5128">Capital funding is provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government through the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to approved voluntary housing bodies to provide accommodation to meet the special housing needs of the elderly, the homeless or people with a physical or intellectual disability. Tenants accommodated in projects funded under CAS are eligible for limited assistance under the rent supplement scheme. The maximum rate of assistance is currently €55 per week for a single person and €60 per week for a couple. Supplementation of rent is reduced to reflect the fact that CAS housing projects are capital funded by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5129">Rents in CAS accommodation are charged at a reasonable rate having regard to the tenant's income and the cost of managing and maintaining the dwellings. It is a matter for each housing association to set the rents payable by their tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5130">CAS tenants are subject to the increase of €6 a week in the weekly minimum contribution which they are required to make towards their rent but not the general 8% reduction in existing rent supplement payment. The maximum rate of rent supplement for those in CAS accommodation is therefore still €55 per week for a single person and €60 per week for a couple.</p>
            <p eId="para_5131">Reductions in rent supplement payments were applied automatically by the Department's computer systems, with effect from 1 June 2009. However, it was not possible to specifically identify CAS tenants and the rent reductions were applied automatically to their rent supplement payments. Community welfare officers were asked to identify CAS tenants and the necessary adjustments are being made to their rent supplement payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5132">The Department is in ongoing discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the role of local authorities who are responsible for providing a wide range of social housing supports for those with a long-term housing need. The continued payment of rent supplement to people in CAS accommodation has been raised with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to having such cases transferred to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) by the end of 2009.</p>

Significant progress has been achieved over the past decade in re-equipping and developing Defence Forces capabilities, using the proceeds from the sales of surplus properties and we need to ensure that this progress is continued. Having regard to the investment needs of the Defence Forces and given the current economic circumstances, it is important that my Department realises the full commercial value of the current properties. It would not therefore be possible to make the property available in the manner the Deputy suggests.</p>

            <p eId="para_5169">Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, General Service Enlistment, Apprenticeship Competition or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.</p>

Following preliminary interviews 220 candidates were called for physical fitness testing.  Of those who attended for physical fitness testing 7 failed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5171">In 2008, 41 Cadets commenced their cadet training on 29 September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5172">In 2008 Apprenticeship Competitions were held for Aircraft Mechanics, Heavy Vehicle Mechanics and Fitter Armourer Apprentices.  A total of 612 applications were received of which 93 underwent physical fitness testing, 15 of whom failed, which equates to 16%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5173">The number of applications received for General Service Enlistment to the Permanent Defence Force in 2008 was 5,466.  A total of 2,916 applicants were called for interview and only 507 General Service Recruits were enlisted in 2008.  The failure rates are not readily available, however as soon as I receive them I will pass them on to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5174">Direct Entry competitions were held in 2008 for Doctors, Aeronautical Engineers and Instrumentalists.  A total of 103 applications were received for these competitions and as a result 3 Doctors and 4 Aeronautical Engineers were appointed while 1 Instrumentalist was enlisted to the Army School of Music.  Direct entrants do not complete induction physical fitness testing as part of the recruitment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5175">A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness.</p>

            <p eId="para_5183">It is a matter for individual housing authorities to plan their social housing investment programmes having regard to the specific social housing priorities in their areas and to the Exchequer funding allocations available to them. €1.3 billion is being provided for the broad range of social housing programmes this year, with €760m of this earmarked for the main local authority housing programme, including €20 million for long-term leasing arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5184">Under the social housing investment programme, local authorities traditionally met social housing needs mainly through the construction of housing in local authority estates. In recent years, the supply channels have been expanded to include an increased number of acquisitions, in particular under Part V agreements, new arrangements with private landlords under the Rental Accommodation Scheme and, more recently, the long-term leasing initiative. At the same time there has also been an expansion in the scale of accommodation provided through the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5185">Taking all the social housing programmes together, including those of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and having regard to the capacity to access suitable housing available in the current housing market through the long-term leasing initiative, it is expected that in the region of 7,000 dwellings will be provided this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5186">The scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.  Subject to these factors, I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which maximises the capacity to meet housing needs, particularly in respect of the most vulnerable sections of society.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government  (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5211">I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 and 502 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5212">The Central Statistics Office (CSO) collects data on vacant properties during the Census as this is the most effective and cost efficient way to audit all housing units nationwide. The 2006 Census found that there were 216,533 unoccupied houses and apartments nationally. The number of vacant properties, broken down by county, is available on the CSO website. Information from the Census provides a crucially important input for policy development across many areas of my Department's brief, including housing policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5213">While a significant number of housing units that are vacant may not necessarily be available for sale or alternative use (for example, there are an estimated 50,000 holiday homes), given weaker sentiment in the housing market, combined with a number of years of very strong supply, my Department has been conscious for some time of a growing overhang in the market of housing units for sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_5214">In order to align economic and social objectives and to make effective use of properties that may be available for re-deployment for social housing purposes, my Department has introduced a number of initiatives of relevance.  In the first instance, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, is designed to cater for the long term housing needs of rent supplement households. The core objectives of the RAS are to reform the approach towards providing accommodation within the private rented sector for long-term dependents on rent supplement and to enhance the response of housing authorities to meeting long-term housing need.  One of the main features of the scheme is that housing authorities, in sourcing accommodation for these households, make use of the private and voluntary sector and enter into contractual arrangements to secure medium to long-term availability of rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5215">To supplement this scheme, I have introduced two additional initiatives in recent months, which will make further use of vacant stock and assist authorities in meeting housing needs.  Firstly, in February 2009, I introduced new arrangements for the delivery of social housing under which housing authorities may enter into long term leases of private dwellings for periods of between 10 and 20 years, taking advantage of the extent of available property in the market and at the same time providing a more efficient and effective use of public resources in meeting housing needs.  Secondly, my Department has advised housing authorities that they can consider transferring unsold affordable housing stock to both the leasing scheme and the RAS, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5216">Data in relation to the number of construction site closures are not held by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5256">Ireland is in receipt of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) support for the period 2007-2013 under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective. There are three Operational Programmes agreed between Ireland and the European Commission for Ireland's allocation of Structural Funds. Two Operational Programmes are co-funded by the ERDF, namely the Border, Midlands and Western Operational Programme (BMW OP) and the Southern and Eastern Operational Programme (S&amp;E OP), whereas the Human Capital Investment Operational Programme (HCI OP) is co-financed by the European Social Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_5257">EU Structural Funds are governed by a series of European Regulations which are agreed among the European Institutions. Following recent consultation between the Institutions, Regulation (EC) No. 397/2009, relating to the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing, was adopted on 6 May 2009. This Regulation broadens the scope of eligibility of ERDF expenditure to allow Member States incur expenditure on energy efficiency improvements and on the use of renewable energy in existing housing, up to an amount of 4% of the total ERDF allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5258">The Managing Authorities of the two ERDF Operational Programmes (BMW OP &amp; S&amp;E OP) have considered the new Regulation but do not propose to change the existing OP priorities as these will fully absorb the level of ERDF funding (€375 million) which has been allocated to Ireland for the period 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_5259">However, it should be noted that I have assigned considerable priority to the improvement of the energy performance of the social housing stock and my Department has developed a comprehensive national programme for the "greening" of the social housing stock. This programme includes a range of energy efficiency initiatives for which some €50 million has been set aside in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5260">The range of energy efficiency improvement initiatives includes a programme of <i>Towards Carbon Neutral</i> demonstration projects, focussed on the construction of dwellings to a minimum Building Energy Rating (BER) standard of A2, as well as a number of demonstration projects for the retrofitting of insulation and other energy efficiency measures in the existing stock of local authority housing to achieve minimum B2 standards. The experience gained from these projects will inform my Department’s approach to both new construction and remedial works schemes, to ensure a viable and energy efficient stock of local authority housing into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_5261">Also, I recently announced close to €20m in allocations to local authorities for the retrofitting of insulation and other energy efficiency improvements in local authority housing prior to re-letting, and in apartment complexes. Local authorities have been preparing energy efficiency plans for their areas to manage the delivery of these improvements which will see the majority of dwellings achieve a minimum BER of C1.</p>
            <p eId="para_5262">Finally, local authorities may use their internal capital receipts, subject to approval by my Department of an annual improvement works programme, for measures including the installation of insulation, the replacement of windows and doors, and other initiatives to improve energy efficiency in their housing stock.</p>

            <p eId="para_5269">Work has been ongoing for some time in my Department in drafting measures to provide for statutory regulation of dog breeding establishments within the dog control legislative regime. The issues involved are complex and required detailed consideration. This process has included discussions with a number of organisations, bodies, public agencies and interests active in this area.  Following advice, it is my intention to introduce amending legislation which will facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group which reviewed the management of dog breeding establishments.  My proposals in this regard are at an advanced stage and will be published as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5270">With regard to groups affiliated to the Association referred to, I propose to exempt such groups from the payment of registration fees.  However, in order to ensure that proper veterinary and general welfare standards exist in those dog breeding establishments, which the Working Group recommended should be defined as ‘a premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential', it is my intention that all relevant dog breeding establishments will be required to comply with specific statutory guidelines in this area and be subject to regulation, registration and inspection by the appropriate local authority.  In this regard I will be guided by professional veterinary advice. As the Association referred to informs me that its members operate to a high standard at present, it is not expected that the new regulatory regime will place a significant additional burden on its affiliated groups.</p>

During any such consultations, the planning authority is required to advise the person concerned of the procedures involved in considering a planning application, and, as far as possible, to indicate the relevant objectives of the development plan which may have a bearing on the decision of the planning authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5275">Section 34 of the 2000 Act provides that where a planning application is made to a planning authority in accordance with permission regulations, and all requirements of those regulations are complied with, the authority may grant or refuse the permission sought.  When making a decision in relation to a planning application, a planning authority is required to have regard, among other things, to the provisions of the relevant development plan.  Under section 30 of the 2000 Act, the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.</p>

The Department has also rented storage space for specialist equipment on a temporary basis since 01 January 2008.  This followed the sale and demolition of the building where the storage had previously been provided by the OPW.  Total rent paid since that date is €32,027.

            <p eId="para_5301">The Government established the Cork Docklands Development Forum in December 2007, to promote the effective coordination and delivery of sustainable public investment in key infrastructure, to facilitate regeneration, and incentivise private investment in Cork Docklands. The Forum was also tasked to address options in relation to incentives to overcome key barriers to the development of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5302">In July 2008, the Forum submitted a report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, setting out a policy and economic rationale for the regeneration project. The Forum report envisaged very significant investment in public infrastructure, including the proposed Eastern Gateway Bridge, as well as possible supports for relocation of port and other activities.  The main findings and recommendations of the report are in the public domain.</p>
            <p eId="para_5303">The Finance Act 2009 provided for a new tax incentive scheme to facilitate the relocation of SEVESO-listed industrial facilities that hinder the regeneration of docklands in urban areas.  This scheme is subject to European Commission clearance regarding compliance with State Aid rules. Funding decisions in relation to the bridge and other related projects have been deferred, having regard to the prevailing budgetary constraints, until at least 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5304">The Inter-Departmental Group established to consider the analysis and recommendations in the Report comprises representatives of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Taoiseach and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It met formally once, on 4 September 2008.  There are no formal minutes of this meeting.  The members of the Group subsequently liaise, with a view to monitoring the scope for appropriate public actions to move this project forward, as and when economic and budgetary circumstances allow.</p>
            <p eId="para_5305">Cork City Council has established a special Directorate to co-ordinate and promote delivery of the Docklands project, as well as a Docklands Policy Committee comprising six local councillors.  The Directorate has extensive interaction with relevant stakeholders including property owners, developers, public agencies and other stakeholders, as well as with the main Departments represented on the Inter-Departmental Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_5307">The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste, published in April 2006, envisages that 80% of biodegradable municipal waste will be diverted from landfill by 2016.  It also views the separate collection and subsequent biological treatment of organic waste to generate compost as having a critical role in minimising the use of landfill into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_5308">While the provision of waste facilities in line with the relevant waste management plan is primarily a matter for the local authorities, recycling, recovery or disposal of commercially arising waste is specifically the responsibility of the producer.  Against this backdrop, my Department is working with industry towards the development of a statutory instrument for the source segregation and appropriate treatment of catering waste and former foodstuffs from commercial premises.  The regulations have already been the subject of a stakeholder consultation, and will shortly issue for public consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5309">I have also signalled my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow for significant increases in the landfill levy. This will make source segregation of waste streams (including organics), and the presentation of quality material for recycling, more attractive for both the commercial and private sectors, with the potential to reduce resource costs and to contribute to the further development of an indigenous composting and recycling industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_5310">I am confident that the above will have the potential to divert significant amounts of commercial food waste from landfill towards more sustainable and environmentally beneficial practices.</p>

            <p eId="para_5312">Rates are local property taxes that are levied by local authorities on commercial properties that are rateable under the Valuation Act 2001.  The determination of the annual rate on valuation which is applied to property valuation to calculate rates is a decision taken locally by the elected members of a local authority in their annual budget.  In order to support economic activity and employment, both nationally and locally, and to protect the interests of communities, I specifically requested that local authorities exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates in their 2009 Budgets.  Local authorities recognise the challenging environment in which business operates and have responded positively to this request. The national average increase in annual rates on valuation in 2009 is 1.15%, with many authorities not introducing any increase at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_5313">I have also asked that each county and city council establish a small Business Support Unit, or alternative, to act as a point of contact to ensure a quick, streamlined and coordinated response to existing and new businesses from local authorities in areas such as planning, water and roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_5314">I recognise the importance of rates income as a contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities.  These services are of considerable benefit to all in the local authority area, including ratepayers and businesses generally. The introduction of rates remission for new business could result in a diminution in the ability of local authorities to deliver such services or in the rates income forgone through such a scheme being raised through an increase in rates charges on other establishments. I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under regular review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5454">Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal options available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department and is also on the Department's website, www.environ.ie.  It is also open to local authorities under sections 107 or 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to initiate an action to deal with noise nuisance and Dublin City Council (Environment Section) is the appropriate authority to contact in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5455">Noise nuisance and other problems caused by local authority tenants are also covered under legislation. The tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to the type of behaviour that is, or is not, acceptable. The local authority is empowered, under Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5456">In the case of noise nuisance being caused by individuals in private rented accommodation, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contains a provision for third parties who are adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce tenant obligations to refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) in accordance with the procedures in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5457">While there is already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, I am currently examining options to strengthen legislation on noise pollution as provided for in the Programme for Government.  The Government recently approved the drafting of a Noise Nuisance Bill which will take a more integrated approach to noise pollution.  There will be a greater emphasis on codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations.  There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of noise nuisance and of how it can be remedied, and to strengthen existing local authority powers including a system of fixed payment notices in relation to noise nuisance offences.  The Bill will also extend to the Garda Síochána some of the more appropriate improved powers of the local authority authorised officers.</p>

            <p eId="para_5467">I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 492 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5468">In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts.  These arise from the requirements for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  This is not a new requirement for 2009, but current economic and budgetary considerations require all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_5469">In order to stay within the overall limit for the General Government Balance, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances and to maintain their current and capital accounts broadly in balance for 2009.  Within this general requirement, there is capability for borrowing by local authorities for capital infrastructure.  Development contributions have been an important addition to the capital funding resource of local authorities but they are only one element.  Local authorities generate capital income from a variety of sources.  There is no prohibition on Councils spending Development Contributions.  The only requirement on local authorities is that they seek to equate capital income and capital expenditure in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5470">My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, including Fingal County Council, to ensure that within the overall financial limits to be met, decisions on these matters are taken in a way which gives the necessary prioritisation to environmental, economic and social infrastructure and taking account of local community effort as part of the overall contribution to economic recovery.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5500">The Government has considered the position in relation to the former Irish Steel/Ispat site at Haulbowline noting the outcome of the site investigations; the requirement for various works and further monitoring recommended by the environmental consultants and the development issues, particularly technical constraints, site boundary issues, zoning issues and regulatory requirements, meriting early address.</p>
            <p eId="para_5501">The Government decided that the Office of Public Works would chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site with Cork County Council continuing to discharge site management responsibilities on an agency basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5502">Regarding the issue of any studies in regard to human health the Government noted the outcomes of the independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions on Haulbowline. This comprised three distinct modules: assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity; assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by current site conditions; and ambient air monitoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_5503">The consultants had available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority.  Ambient air monitoring was undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international occupational exposure limit values, finding that air quality complied with all relevant standards and guidelines, including in Cobh which was the main population centre that was monitored, and that there is no occupational risk to human health from airborne substances.  Similarly, the assessment of water, sediment and mussel samples employed the relevant applicable screening criteria and found no identifiable risk to the residents of Cork Harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_5504">In the case of assessing the health and environmental risks posed by potential contaminants in the waste material on the East Tip itself the screening was undertaken using human health generic assessment criteria which are derived from guidance issued in the UK.  These criteria were considered most appropriate for the site, are conservative for on-site exposures for current land use, and did not suggest a risk to health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area including the Naval Base.</p>

            <p eId="para_5506">The number of households on a local authority's waiting list continuously fluctuates as households on the list are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.

            <p eId="para_5507">A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Housing Act 1988.  The last assessment took place in 2008 and indicated that there were 56,249 households in need of social housing support.  In Cork, the assessment showed that there were 6,589 households in need of social housing support; 3,725 households in the Cork County Council area (including Town Councils), and 2,864 in Cork City Council's area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5508">Further information regarding the assessments is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie, including a breakdown of the net need figure by housing authority.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5517">I propose to take Questions Nos. 504 to 510, inclusive, and 512 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5518">My Department's involvement with the voluntary and co-operative housing schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects.  The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5519">Approved housing bodies are responsible for the proper management and maintenance of dwellings provided under the terms of the funding schemes and for the operation of letting policies, the fixing of rents and compliance with all relevant statutory requirements.  Tenancy matters are generally covered in the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement between an approved housing body and tenant, which are broadly based on Landlord and Tenant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520">Complaints in relation to the management and operation of voluntary housing schemes, including complaints by individual tenants, are, in the first instance, a matter between the tenant and the relevant approved housing body.  Tenants may also make complaints to the local authority where accommodation provided by an approved housing body is not considered to be in compliance with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008.  Local authorities, may in certain circumstances, mediate in tenancy disputes between an approved housing body and their tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5521">The Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) and the National Association of Building Co-operatives (Nabco) are the representative bodies for the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in Ireland.  Both organisations provide promotion, information, advice and training services to approved housing bodies. The ICSH provides a range of housing management services to approved housing bodies including a Housing Association Performance Management framework which aims to promote good housing management practice and to demonstrate accountability to customers and stakeholders.  The ICSH also makes available a Standard Tenancy Agreement for Housing Associations as well as Rent Books for use by approved housing bodies, details of which are available on the ICSH website at www.icsh.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5522">In line with the commitments set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities my Department is currently undertaking, with the assistance of outside consultants, a strategic review of the role of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the provision, maintenance and management of social rented accommodation in Ireland.  I intend to publish the consultancy report being prepared as part of this review following its completion later in the Autumn and to engage in consultation with stakeholders on the issues arising from the report.  It is not possible, from the systems in place, to state definitively the number of representations received by my Department from tenants of approved housing bodies, but it is considered that the numbers involved are not significant.  However, the need for an independent review mechanism on tenancy disputes between approved housing bodies and their tenants will be considered in the light of the review referred to above.</p>

A body seeking to obtain, and to retain, approved status under Section 6 of the Act must have as primary objects, the provision of accommodation for low-income families or persons with special needs such as the elderly, the homeless or persons with a physical or intellectual disability and must have in its memorandum of association or registered rules, as the case may be, provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members and requiring that the assets of the body be applied solely towards its objects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5530">Approved housing bodies are the owners of the accommodation schemes financed under my Department's capital funding schemes.

On 19 January 2001, the then Department of Public Enterprise entered into an Agreement with ESBT for the deployment of 1,300 kilometres of optical fibre cable around Ireland.  The ESBT network comprises 48 optical fibre pairs and is wrapped on the electricity high voltage network.</p>
            <p eId="para_5550">Construction of the network was completed in 2003.  The total cost of the project was €48.18m.

ESBT has strengthened competition in the market and are providing competitively priced managed bandwidth services and dark fibre to telecommunications service providers on a wholesale basis.

            <p eId="para_5554">Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No CS303 2009, which prohibits fishing for eel and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition on Issue of Licences) Bye-law No 858, 2009, which prohibits the issue of eel fishing licenses in any fishery district, were recently introduced in an effort to protect our dwindling eel stocks.  For this reason it is not possible for the regional fisheries board to issue a licence to the applicant mentioned by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5555">The bye-laws give effect to the National Eel Management Plan prepared in compliance with EU Council Regulation No. 1100/2007, establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel and recently approved by the EU Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5556">The target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that "the objective of each Member State's Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock".  In other words, the regulation requires that 4 kg of eels escape to sea for every 10 kg that would have escaped if people did not kill any or prevent any from migrating and the number of elvers coming into the water was as high as it every was.  The national percent escapement is calculated as being only 24%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5557">Stocks are in such perilous condition that the only way the target could be achieved was by undertaking a series of management actions including cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market, mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive silver eel trap and transport plan, ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers and improve water quality including fish health and bio-security issues.  The effectiveness of these actions will be reviewed in 2012.  In the meantime, the Central fisheries board and eel fishermen's representative will be engaged in investigating possible diversification schemes for the former commercial fishermen.</p>

            <p eId="para_5560">The location was selected on the basis of the requirement to be sufficiently far down river to capture data on the run of fish to all tributaries.  Access to the counter is important and this was influenced by the availability of publicly owned property at the site. I am informed by the SWRFB, which has overseen the installation of the fish counter that on engineering advice the effects on potential flooding upstream and downstream of the installation will be insignificant.</p>

In turn, my Department pays An Post a commission for the collection of the standard licences and for administration in respect of the free licences.  Once this payment is deducted, 95% of net television licence fee receipts (both free and standard television licences) are paid to RTÉ and 5% of net television licence receipts are paid to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in respect of the Broadcasting Fund.  This latter rate will increase to 7% under the Broadcasting Bill 2008, which was recently passed by the Oireachtas.</p>

Further RFTs for the upgrade of HEAnet's core infrastructure, router and content filtering and Local Area Networks will issue shortly.  I expect rollout of the pilot project to be completed by summer 2010.  The cost of the project will depend on the successful tenders.</p>

            <p eId="para_5602">The Policy Paper ‘Next Generation Broadband  — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland', which was published on my Department's website on 22 June 2009 has, as one of its actions, the establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide service providers with flexible and open-access to existing and future State owned infrastructure suitable for telecoms services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5603">Leveraging publicly owned ducting has the capacity to significantly reduce costs for private sector investors in rolling out fibre to the regions and thereby improve competition in the electronic communications market.</p>
            <p eId="para_5604">My officials have worked with the relevant State agencies in the energy and transport sectors to compile a data-base of the supply of publicly-owned-infrastructure, which currently or potentially can support high speed broadband networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5605">Following this process, maps have been compiled, which provide an indicative depiction of the supply of relevant State infrastructure including the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  These maps were published on my Department's website in conjunction with the policy paper and can therefore be accessed on the website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5606">It is important to note that the readiness of this infrastructure to support high speed broadband networks varies between agencies and can depend, for example, on whether an agency is already involved in the telecom sector and, if so, whether existing contractual arrangements may restrict the infrastructure being available on an open-access basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5607">The next step in developing the one-stop-shop is to decide on an operational model and I expect to make a decision on this shortly.</p>

        <b>Deputy Paul Connaughton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         the reason the Central Fisheries Board introduced a new compulsory licence on the River Suck more than four years ago for course angling; the basis of the implementation of such a licence on the River Suck; the further reason it was found not necessary to have a similar licence on other course angling rivers elsewhere here; the number of tourist angling accommodation units which have ceased trading in the River Suck region since the introduction of the new permit; the amount of revenue generated by the licence permit system over the past four years in the region; the cost of enforcing and administering this particular scheme on the River Suck over the past four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5663">Under the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2001, the Regional Fisheries Boards are empowered to apply a permit charge for angling on fisheries under their control.  The application of such a permit charge is a day-to-day operational matter for the relevant Board, in this instance the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board (ShRFB).  Within the region, the ShRFB controls 27 fisheries including the River Suck.</p>
            <p eId="para_5664">I am advised by the ShRFB that it has had a permit charge for trout angling for over 50 years on fisheries under its control.  I understand that the fisheries board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the Board controlled fisheries, on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species, on the same water, was not charged.  The cost of managing these fisheries has increased over the years and the ShRFB is of the view that coarse anglers who utilise the fisheries should contribute to the cost of their upkeep.</p>
            <p eId="para_5665">I am advised by the Board that the revenue generated by the licence permit system over the period 2005-2008 in the region is €317,146.  The ShRFB assures me that the permit income is reinvested in the conservation and day-to-day management and development of these fisheries.  I am informed that the duties of the staff of the ShRFB are multi-disciplinary and in the circumstances it is not possible to identify the cost of enforcement and administration on a particular stretch of water within the fisheries controlled by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_5666">It has been the Board's experience that where tourist anglers are informed that funds raised through angling permits, which entitle them to fish on all 27 fisheries controlled by the ShRFB, are reinvested in the fishery, they are willing to contribute.</p>
            <p eId="para_5667">The Board has no information on the number of tourist angling accommodation units which may have closed or for what reason.  The ShRFB, in conjunction with the other fisheries boards and Fáilte Ireland, has taken many initiatives to address the decline in angling tourist activity in this area.  The prospects for the future of tourist angling accommodation units will, I believe, be supported by the river restoration programmes, the preservation of healthy stocks through protection and environmental work undertaken by the regional fisheries boards and the marketing initiatives taken at regional and national level.</p>

            <p eId="para_5705">The Seafood Development Measure contained in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is divided between the EU Co-funded Operational Programme and the National Seafood Development Operational Programme. The EU Co-funded OP has already commenced and has funded the 2008 decommissioning scheme which has allowed  46 boats to be decommissioned with grant aids totalling €36.6 million already paid and this scheme is now closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5706">The N+2 rule relates to the decommitment of EU funds if a member state does not submit a claim for the annual allocation of EU funds within two years of this allocation. The first allocation given to Ireland was in 2008 as the Seafood Development Operational Programme was not adopted by the Commission until September 2008. Therefore, under the N+2 rule Ireland will have a cut-off date of December 31 2010 to submit a claim to the EU commission. Officials in my Department are now in the process of preparing a claim to the EU Commission which is well in advance of the N+2 rule requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5707">The National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 which is fully funded by the Exchequer will not be affected by the N+2 rule as no EU funds are committed to this Operational Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5723">Ireland has been free of rabies for over a hundred years.  The arrangements that are in place with regard to the import of non-commercial pets are designed to maintain our rabies-free status. Because of our status, more stringent arrangements apply than in some other European countries. Prior to 2004, all pets being imported from outside the UK, which shared our disease free status, had to be placed in quarantine before being released to their owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5724">Since 2004 the EU Pet Passport system has applied.  It is a harmonised system covering the movement of pet dogs and cats throughout the EU. However the Member States historically free of rabies, which includes Ireland, the UK, Sweden, Finland and Malta, negotiated additional safeguards.  Under this system, pet cats and dogs are allowed to enter / re enter into Ireland provided that:</p>
            <p eId="para_5725">The animal is travelling from an eligible country.</p>
            <p eId="para_5726">The animal is identified by means of a microchip.</p>
            <p eId="para_5727">The animal has been vaccinated against rabies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5728">In addition, the following conditions are specific for entry/re-entry in to Ireland and the UK. The animal has, at least 6 months before entry/re-entry been successfully blood-tested for rabies anti-bodies The animal has been correctly treated for against tick and tapeworm. The evidence that an animal complies with the last four conditions above will be contained in the Pet Passport, a document standardised throughout the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_5729">Given our absolute determination to remain rabies free and the grave implications of any error occurring in the system, all dogs and cats must be checked on arrival to establish their entitlement to enter/re-enter the country. To this end the requirement that pets travel as manifest cargo serves to minimise the risk of ineligible pets entering Ireland.  The Deputy will appreciate the ever-present risk of smuggling involving small animals in personal cabin baggage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5730">On arrival, all animals are transported directly for examination to the secure quarantine facility at Lissenhall, Swords which is in close proximity to the airport. This examination consists of establishing the pet's identity by scanning of its microchip and a check of details in the Pet Passport to ensure all conditions for entry are met. All the necessary veterinary facilities and support are available there to cater for any of the eventualities that might arise.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_5734">The Deputy will be aware, given that veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities, their locations are driven by commercial realities and as such I do not have a direct involvement in the issue referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5735">However, insofar as official regulation impacts on this area of activity, I can point to a number of measures contained in Animal Remedies regulations which should help to alleviate difficulties which may arise in certain parts of the country as a result of an inadequate veterinary service. Under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, there is a provision which for the first time enables the Veterinary Council to recognise qualifications from applicants in Third Countries generally. This, taken with the enlargement of the EU, will make for improved availability of practitioners to meet shortfalls that may arise on the supply side, particularly in areas such as that referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5736">Furthermore, in regard to treatments, in recent years my Department has, within the limited room for manoeuvre afforded by EU legislation, adapted national medicines legislation to address practical problems, including the ready availability of veterinary practitioners.  For example, we have progressively, since 2005, afforded greater flexibility to farmers and their vets to make practical and mutually convenient arrangements for veterinary cover for their animals.  This has been achieved by giving the vet much greater scope than heretofore to decide, on the basis of his/her professional judgement, the situations where animals must be physically examined prior to prescribing. The current legal requirement is that the vet must, as a minimum, have visited the farm concerned once within the previous twelve months before prescribing ‘prescription only' medicines for animals on that farm.  In addition, whereas previously vets could only prescribe for one month, they are now allowed, in appropriate circumstances, to prescribe for up to one year. This latter facility enables farmers and their vets to work out prospective treatment requirements for the season and for the farmer to get a prescription which can be dispensed as and when the need arises.</p>
            <p eId="para_5737">I recognise, of course, that emergency situations also arise where an unforeseen serious problem with an animal can give rise to welfare issues.  Existing legislation provides that, in an emergency situation, a person, other than a vet, may treat an animal and a pharmacist may supply ‘prescription only' medicines (including antibiotics) on the basis of a verbal communication from the vet concerned; in such situations, the vet is required to supply a written prescription with 72 hours. Also in circumstances of emergency animal welfare issues arising on farms, Veterinary Inspectors from my Department's District Veterinary Offices have powers to deal with such emergencies including the provision of emergency care and feeding of welfare-compromised farm animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_5738">In summary, my Department has made vigorous efforts over the years to address practical problems which may arise from the unavailability of a veterinary service in particular areas and the changes made to animal remedies regulations should go a long way to ameliorate these problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_5749">My Department, as a sanctioning agency has an obligation to ensure that, as  part of suitability assessment for placing on tender lists for projects,  Contractors have adequate economic and financial capacity. One of the key  criteria for assessing financial and economic capacity is the average annual  turnover of the contracting company over the previous three years. The purpose  of this is to ensure that the firm has adequate capacity and will not be  overstretched if it is successful in winning the tender competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_5750">The turnover requirement for school building projects is normally approximately  2 times the estimated contract value over the three previous financial years.  In the case of the rapid construction programme, the turnover required for  Building Construction is €10m, and €13m for overall business operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5751">The rapid programme is divided into lots. In practical terms what this  requirement means is that any firm applying would be capable of taking on two  projects (or lots) of similar size at the same time. The contract periods on  these projects are set at a reasonable level in compliance with health and  safety requirements; however, there is also a strict requirement to meet the  completion date in order to comply with school term times. This imposes a  requirement on the Design &amp;Build operator to carefully programme the project to  ensure timely delivery including off-site construction. Where a Contractor does  not have adequate economic and financial capacity and is consequently  overstretched, he/she may not be able to meet these targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_5752">I should mention that in addition to major projects I approve hundreds of  smaller building projects each year under the Summer Works Scheme and other  Devolved Programmes, most of which may be tendered for by smaller builders. In this regard over 1,600 such projects have been approved in 2009.</p>

The NCSE operates within my Department's  criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_5779">SNAs are sanctioned by SENOs to schools specifically to assist in the care of  pupils and students with disabilities in an educational context.  Where a pupil  in receipt of SNA support transfers from one school to another, the care needs  of the pupil concerned will be examined in the context of the overall  allocation already in the school. This may mean that the SNA support required  can be met from within the school's existing allocation and no additional SNA  support is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5780">The recruitment of any additional SNA support and the deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. The Board is the SNA's employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.</p>

Legal costs incurred by the State, in prosecuting those cases which  are brought to court, are not met directly by my Department. In accordance with  financial procedures in cases taken by the State, legal costs are generally  charged to the Chief State Solicitor's Office Vote as sanctioned by the  Attorney General. The Department does not take lightly any decision to take a  case against another party. However, there are a range of potential  circumstances within which this may be necessary, e.g. for overpayments or  misappropriation of monies, or to require compliance with a particular set of  statutory or contractual obligations or arrangements. Given the small number of  cases involved, an elaboration on the range of circumstances that gave rise to  the litigation could lead to the identification of the individual Defendants or  Respondents, which would be inappropriate given that some of these cases are  still before the Courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_5796">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5797">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard  a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5798">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the  Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_5799">The Deputy may be aware that a Common Application System (CAS) was agreed between the principals of the post-primary schools in Limerick City. This  system has been facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre (LEC) with  support from my Department. This administrative system ensures that a  coordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5800">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for  their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board,  National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <p eId="para_5809">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a position to reverse any of the decisions taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_5810">I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.  In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_5811">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on  individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>

My Department is currently finalising the data for publication and I expect that this data will be placed on my Department's website in the coming period.

            <p eId="para_5817">These allocations when published will be provisional at this stage and will reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5818">The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards will have been considered. The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.  The data on my Department's website will be further updated later in the year when final allocations are determined.</p>

            <p eId="para_5828">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5829">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5830">Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_5831">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

The circular sets out a structured and transparent approach for the operation of the alleviation measures that were announced in the budget for schools that have a significant concentration of newcomer pupils. The alleviation measures mean that these schools can qualify for up to 4 language support posts with the possibility of  additional posts also being approved through the independent staffing appeals mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_5852">Schools can now apply to my Department in the normal way for language support posts. These posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed in September 2009 following receipt from the schools of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support. It is estimated that notwithstanding the budget measures there will be approximately 1,500 language support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_5861">However the issue of a further extension of time for applications to the Redress Board is amongst a range of issues raised by groups representing survivors of abuse.  The issues raised will receive full consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_5872">Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5873">I have always accepted and acknowledged that the decision in the Budget last October to increase the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools will have an impact on class sizes and subject choices in our post-primary schools from the commencement of the 2009/10 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5874">Schools will make choices as a consequence of the changes made in the Budget. Some will decide to increase class size particularly in the subjects taken by most students. Some may decide to eliminate some subjects from the choice of subjects that they offer. Some will combine increasing the numbers in some classes with eliminating subjects. In making such decisions individual schools may also decide to prioritise some subjects or programmes over others. Some schools may give a priority to Junior cycle or particular subjects at Junior cycle and others may prioritise Senior Cycle and particular Leaving Certificate subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5875">At the level of individual schools the changes in relation to the allocation of teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers  than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. Across the school system generally there will inevitably be an impact on class sizes and my Department will through the normal process of examining applications for curricular concessions endeavour to ensure continuity of provision for those already preparing for the certificate examinations. The changes at second level are more likely to impact on the range of subjects that schools will be able to offer those starting the Junior or Leaving Certificate programmes next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_5876">I undertook to publish information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and this was done earlier this year in relation to primary schools. The Deputy may be interested to know that information on the current position regarding teacher allocations to second level schools, whether enrolment related or otherwise, will be published on my Department's website in the coming period. My intention is that, just as is the case with the information provided in relation to primary schools, this information will identify the changed position for second level schools and VECs arising from the October budget decisions. The information will represent the position at this stage and is not the final position. At this point allocations for areas such as special needs, language support and curricular needs are still in process. The information will be further updated later in the year when final allocations are determined and the final position regarding supernumerary posts remaining in school emerges.</p>

            <p eId="para_5956">The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the Tabular Statement.  The figures for post-primary teachers do not include VEC teachers where the retirements and pension benefit awards are made by the relevant VEC.  The bulk of teachers retirements occur at the end of August each year.  The figures for 2009 contained in the Tabular Statement relate to retirements up to 30 June 2009 only and are therefore not reflective of the likely out-turn for the year as a whole.</p>

Data showing the proportions of students dropping out by County are available in Table 5 of this Report. This information is not currently available for later years.

            <p eId="para_6307">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. This includes the work of the National Educational Welfare Board, established under the Education Welfare Act, 2000, to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS. Targeted interventions include the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison services, visiting teacher service for Travellers, additional funding for pupils at risk of early school leaving and alternative curricular options. On Monday 18th May, I announced that from the start of the next school year, in September 2009, a single co-ordinated School Support Programme involving the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, the School Completion Programme and the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers will be integrated under the National Educational Welfare Board. This development will put in place structures to facilitate closer integration of the services at local, regional and national levels, increase effectiveness and help bring about real and meaningful improvements in services to confront in a cohesive way the underlying causes that impact negatively on the school life of children, particularly as they relate to school attendance, retention and attainment.</p>

If their remit is to be expanded to encompass primary education it is desirable that this should be done by primary legislation setting out the nature and extent of their duties and voted upon by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The General Scheme of an Education (Patronage) Bill 2009 has recently approved by the Government for drafting and I hope to have the Bill published and passed during the Autumn session 2009.  The new model of primary school patronage is being explored in a pilot model in two locations in Dublin 15.

In the interim the school has recently been allocated an all-in grant for the provision of an additional classroom to meet its current needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_6373">The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least 4 years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a National School.  The primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course, including a  two year infant cycle followed by six years in standards from first to sixth, with children progressing to the next grade at the end of each school year. Pupils commencing school for the first time should be enrolled at the commencement of the school year in order to complete the full primary school course.</p>
            <p eId="para_6374">I have been informed by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) that under the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which will be implemented by the OMCYA from January 2010, children will normally qualify to participate in the scheme where they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September of each year.  In January 2010, children will be eligible if they are aged between 3 years 7 months and 4 years 10 months.  Exceptions to the upper age limit will be allowed where children are assessed by the HSE to have special needs or it  is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  The provision of a 15 month age range for eligibility is designed to give flexibility to parents to access the scheme at the most appropriate time for their children prior to commencing school and the majority of children who participate in the scheme would be expected to commence primary school between the age of 4 years 3 months and 5 years 6 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_6376">As the Deputy is aware, the process to develop a new national strategy for higher education is now underway which is being overseen by a high level steering group, chaired by economist Dr Colin Hunt and comprising national and international expertise including academic, business, community and student interests, as well as senior government officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_6377">The process affords a timely opportunity to review the environment for higher education and the challenges and changes that are impacting on the sector. An examination of the overall operational, governance and resourcing framework are important elements of the strategy review. The process will consider objectives for participation in higher education as a key aspect of its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6378">In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the sector. Our higher education system relies disproportionately on Exchequer sources of funding and it is appropriate to look to wider means of meeting future additional resource requirements having  particular regard to the difficult budgetary and economic climate that is in prospect in the medium term. As the Deputy is aware I have asked my officials to undertake a review of policy options in relation to the consideration of the introduction of a form of student contribution. There are many complex and competing considerations including the funding matters referred to by the  Deputy which need to be taken into account in the consideration of all available options. I am now arranging to provide the completed technical report to my Cabinet colleagues for their initial consideration.  I would envisage that this will be formally discussed at Cabinet at a later date.</p>

            <p eId="para_6381">There has been a 45% increase in international student numbers in Irish higher education institutions, including private institutions, since 2004.  "Building Ireland's Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal"  recognises the benefits of further increasing international student numbers.  These include significant economic benefits to the higher education  institutions and to the wider economy and also longer-term benefits for Ireland, as international students are likely to contribute to the development of stronger networks of influence for Ireland overseas, enhancing exchanges with traditional partners, as well as strengthening our contacts in regions where the country has not traditionally had a strong profile, such as Asia and  the Gulf.  I will shortly be announcing measures to position Ireland as a destination of choice in the international education market through new regulatory and marketing co-ordination arrangements that will enhance the promotion of Irish education overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_6419">Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school capacity at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.</p>
            <p eId="para_6420">The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in a total of 42 locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. The process of circulating this information to all existing school Patrons has commenced and it will be open to Patrons to bring forward proposals  for the expansion of existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school. The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6421">Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed accommodation requirement reports for these locations which will identify the accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.  School accommodation requirements in the Athlone area and its environs, including parts of South Roscommon, will be considered as part of this detailed study of the 42 areas identified. It is expected that the report on the Athlone area will be completed in the coming weeks.</p>
