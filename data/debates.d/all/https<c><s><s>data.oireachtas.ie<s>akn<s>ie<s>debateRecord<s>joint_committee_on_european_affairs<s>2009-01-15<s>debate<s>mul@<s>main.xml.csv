#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I extend new year's greetings to all members of the committee, those who helped us during the year, staff and our participating guests.Item No. 1 on the agenda is the European Commission Green Paper on Agricultural Product Quality: Product Standards, Farming Requirements and Quality Schemes.  This is a continuation of a previous discussion held before the recent debate on the pork and bacon issue.  It was considered by members that the Green Paper was important in view of the fact that this country has a serious interest in standards and the quality and all other aspects of food production and competitiveness in the marketplace.  It was on that basis that the committee decided to take a particular interest in this sector.  This happened prior to the glitch in December which alerted everyone to the matter.  It is to be hoped that as a result of the Green Paper, procedures will be put in place to ensure the continuity and application of quality standards in the food production sector across the European Union allowing it to achieve self-sufficiency and ensure security of supply and thus compete with all competitors.We are joined by delegations from the IFA, ICSA and FDII.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Chairman for inviting the IFA and providing it with an opportunity to address the committee on this important subject.  As I am conscious of the fact that there is a limitation on time, I do not intend to cover all the issues arising from the EU Green Paper or the debate held on 11 December.  I intend to deal with a number of important points and will be glad to deal with other issues that may arise in course of the debate.Regarding globalisation and standards, the very first sentence of the EU Green Paper reads: "As globalisation spreads products from emerging countries with low production costs are putting greater pressure on EU farmers".  What is not stated is that many emerging countries have low production costs and standards in quality, product hygiene, food safety, traceability and environmental and animal welfare issues, standards significantly below the high standards which apply to production within the European Union.  This is a key policy issue for the Union and must be addressed in this paper.  European consumers demand top quality, safe food produced to the highest standards in the world.  They are entitled to have this at affordable prices.  Irish and other European farmers are in a position to deliver top quality, safe food produced to the highest standards to European consumers.The policy environment in which we European farmers work, however, cannot be undermined by the globalisation threat such that standards and quality are disregarded in a race to the bottom on price.  In the IFA we have first-hand experience of this in Brazilian beef, chicken from Thailand, pigmeat from South America.  The last EU Food and Veterinary Office report on Brazil identified illegal practices by the Brazilian accredited certified body for animal identification in respect of the farmers audited and cleared for export by the EU.  The office told the Commission that none of the Brazilian certifiers met during the mission had counted the animals or read the ear tags during their visit to approve and inspect holdings for the EU list.  Brazil does not meet the EU standards on key issues of food safety, disease control animal identification and traceability, and environmental controls such as the burning of rain-forests.  Nevertheless, the Commission and the trade sector in Europe are tripping over themselves to allow more Brazilian beef into Europe and the WTO.  This is a double standard, a high standard for European producers and a low one for imports, that cannot be allowed to continue.Another example of double standards concerns the EU proposals for pesticides which impose strict limits on European producers and none on imports.  Imports into the Union must meet the same high standards as apply to production in Europe.  The Green Paper must deal with this fundamental issue.Consumers want safe food at affordable prices.  To win market share and to increase their margins, retailers are constantly engaged in a price war, and discounts or 'buy one get one free' offers, 33% off are the order of the day almost every day.  Nothing is spared in applying maximum pressure on processors and primary producers to produce more for less all the time.  Standards and quality will suffer when retailers face production into a below cost, non-viable economic position.  A Minister recently stated that farmers are being shafted in the battle for supermarket share.  The EU Green Paper and legislators in these Houses must address this issue.  It is not possible or sustainable to offer quality, safe food for less than the cost of production.At farm level Ireland has high quality traceability systems for cattle, sheep and pigs.  Our computerised movement and monitoring system and database for cattle is one of the best in the world.  We also have effective systems at farm level for sheep and pigs.  One of the expensive lessons we must learn from the recent dioxin scare is that the traceability system for pigmeat beyond the farm gate at primary and secondary processing level is less than adequate.  This must be examined and addressed.  Never again can we have a situation whereby pigmeat on an identified farm or farms which has been withdrawn for whatever reason would require a total recall.  This is not acceptable.  As a minimum we must have an effective batch traceability system at processor and retail level for pigmeat.  The system at farm level for cattle, sheep and pigs is effective.Proper labelling of food products is an essential requirement to meet the interests of the consumer and the producers.  Country of origin labelling for beef at retail level is a requirement under EU legislation.  In practice this works well and the consumer who purchases beef in the supermarket knows where it comes from.  In 2007 the Government introduced legislation on the country of origin for beef at restaurant, hotel and catering level, requiring outlets selling beef to the public to state or display the country of origin.  Responsibility for enforcing this legislation was given to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.  Unfortunately, in many restaurants, pubs, hotels and catering outlets the requirement has been ignored and the FSAI has done little to enforce the law.  This issue must be addressed.For other meats such as lamb, pork and chicken the IFA has proposed full country of origin labelling.  The Government supported this proposal but claims that the Commission will not allow it because of unfair competition.  The issue must be addressed in the Green Paper because preventing Ireland from providing consumers and producers with full country of origin labelling on meat is misleading and a denial of fair competition.  The issue of substantial transformation must also be addressed.  It is not acceptable for processors to import a product such as chicken from outside the EU, cover it with breadcrumbs and call it an Irish product.I am aware that another committee in this House is undertaking a full investigation and hearing of all the issues associated with the dioxin scare.  What happened is unacceptable and must never be allowed to happen again.  We cannot afford to place Ireland's reputation as a quality food producer in jeopardy.  Farmers or processors involved in the pigmeat and beef sector are totally innocent.  As far as we know the dioxin problem involves a breakdown in, and inadequate monitoring of, the licence process for recycling of human food into the animal feed chain.  It appears that aspects of the recycling process are not properly covered in either national or EU regulation.  This regulatory gap must be closed.Members of this committee are aware there is a high level of regulation covering farming and primary production.  All farmers are subject to cross-compliance and good agricultural and environmental conditions.  These cover areas such as public and animal health and plant welfare and the environment.  Farmers feel that there is an over-zealous interpretation of the application of regulations here on issues such as calendar farming under the nitrates directive.  The cost associated with over-regulation poses a major problem for our competitiveness.  We must have a level playing field with our competitors on regulation.  We cannot lose our competitive edge due to the cost of over-regulation.Bord Bia operates a comprehensive quality assurance system covering all major farm enterprises.  These schemes cover in excess of 70% of our production.  We have a quality assurance scheme for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, chicken, eggs, horticulture and potatoes.

I apologise for any inconvenience that causes.  We will follow the presentations with questions and answers.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I thank the committee members for the opportunity to present the views of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, on the questions posed by the EU Green Paper on agriculture.  It is not possible in the time allocated to me to go through our document in full but it has been circulated to the committee members.I will deal briefly with the substantive issues.  I am indebted to my colleague Gillian Westbrook for the technical research.  If the committee members have any technical questions I will pass them to her.Consumers have highlighted concern about modern farming practices and methods of food production but they are often unaware of the efforts and changes made by farmers to elevate the quality of their produce.  The introduction of the single farm payment, for instance, brought in onerous cross-compliance rules.However, the consumer is often unaware of the efforts and changes made by farmers in order to elevate the quality of their produce.  The introduction of the single farm payment, for instance, brought with it onerous cross-compliance rules and strengthened traceability controls.  In addition, many farmers have volunteered to go that extra mile by deciding to produce food and to farm in ways which impose further restrictions, such as organic farming, GM-free farming, participation in environmental programmes, etc.  Schemes such as REPS have responded to societal demands regarding the environmental impact of farming.  This means farmers are now producing food that has a lot of value added at farm gate level and offers consumers a choice of quality standards that are unsurpassed anywhere else in the world.EU agriculture is now multi-functional, providing top quality food which addressing many concerns such as environmental protection and biodiversity.  The challenge now is to communicate this to the discerning consumer and to ensure that farmers get recognition which translates into better prices for their efforts.  At present the consumer is unable to clearly identify these additional attributes.  The Green Paper correctly outlines the need to ensure that additional quality aspects of EU food production are communicated effectively to the consumer.  Moreover, it reflects the fact that telling the consumer about quality can be done in a way that the consumer can understand, can depend on and can trust.  Consumers must be given information that allows them to make a fair comparison between various food choices and the farming practices involved.  For this reason the ICSA recommends the development of a policy and legislative framework that builds on what has already been done.  It would provide consumers with information on baseline farming standards while at the same time allowing for extension into additional standards, such as those found in REPS in organic farming, in GM-free methods of production.We are proposing that the country of origin of all primary produce is clearly displayed on the label and consider this is especially important for products of animal origin.  The current beef labelling legislation is flawed in that exemptions within the labelling requirements make it ineffective for both the consumer and the producer.  Within our own national legislation, which requires country of origin labelling in catering establishments, beef burgers that contain less than 99% meat do not have to display the country of origin.  An integral part of any new strategy must include country of origin labelling as a basic requirement for any primary product.With regard to definitions of optional and general reserve terms, we suggest that it is necessary for the EU to define "reserve terms" describing farming methods, in particular those that are becoming more popular in current consumer trends, for example, grass fed beef or low carbon food, but with a degree of flexibility to take into consideration regional and climatic variations that would very much impact on Irish production.  Some member states are already considering sponsoring a low carbon award scheme for the farming industry.  This should be extended EU-wide if EU products are to remain competitive in their own marketplace.With regard to the use of international standards, there are many contentious issues when comparing international with EU standards.  For example, the US will not accept cheese made from unpasteurised milk and the Europeans will not accept hormones in beef.  The EU should take into consideration the international standard but place the requirements of the European consumer first.  That is, after all, under the umbrella of consumer protection.Current EU schemes, coupled with an amended labelling legislation, could well form the basis for the way forward.  However, it is clear that the implementation of the regulations must be intelligently focused and steered more towards the source rather than the user in the case of feed products.  An example is the recent PCB dioxin scare where the feed recycler had not been inspected for the previous 12 months.  Irish producers need to be encouraged to make more use of geographic indications.  Currently, only four Irish producers are registered to do so.  The low uptake on this may be due to the lengthy bureaucratic process that it takes to become registered.  The scheme does, however, add value to produce.In recent years, there has been a notable increase in farm certification schemes, mainly from privately owned certifiers.  The ICSA recognises the benefit of certification schemes in assisting with the marketing of produce.  The question of whether certification schemes actually enhance product quality will greatly depend on the scheme and the specific commodity.  If the EU were to make a guideline, it should require certification schemes to demonstrate progressive developments that are beneficial to food safety and respond to consumer interests, for example, animal welfare.  EU guidelines should discourage unquantifiable aspects that cause meaningless paperwork with no relation to scientific risk.  Certifiers should be required to undertake analytical testing and not just an audit of documentation.  Ultimately, our concern is that certification should result in better product reputation and, in turn, result in better farm gate prices.In summary, the ICSA would like to see a retain environment where consumers are always able to choose European product where the quality and origin is clearly defined and easily understood.  We see this as a system of regulated logos and labels whereby farmers are recognised for their efforts.  Each product would indicate country of origin and demonstrate that it was produced to the EU baseline standard.  For those producers who go to the next level, those producers who go that extra mile and participate in REPS or who are farming organically, or who can certify that their product is GM free or grass fed, should have their niche also clearly identified on the label.While the eventual design of the label and the logo will, I have no doubt, come down to those marketing experts who are good at that job, key elements for a logo should be a readily recognisable national symbol such as the Irish map or the Irish flag, as well as the EU logo, and incorporating symbols which would indicate the specific attributes of the product.  For example, an "O" in the middle of the logo would mean it was an organic product.  It would be clear, therefore, that the logo would not be available to countries outside the EU.In the long term, clear labelling will facilitate the marketing and sale of our product.  It is high time that the consumer's right to simple unambiguous information is vindicated and EU farmers received a price that reflects the quality of their produce.  A wise man once said that quality is like buying oats; if one wants nice clean oats, one must play a fair price but that if one is satisfied with oats that have already been through the horse, such oats can be had a little cheaper.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I thank the committee for its invitation to us to speak today about what we consider to be a very important policy paper and something that is of key relevance to our industry.  In our initial thoughts in regard to addressing the committee on this paper we have chosen to stick very tightly within the definition and terms of the Green Paper.  This is a very important policy document.  There will be 27 other opinions on it.  Other committees are conducting similar hearings to this one.  We need to consider the likely reaction in terms of our ability to continue as an export oriented industry, an industry that I stress has a very strong future.  Let me give an example of what I mean by that.  Recently, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food supported increases in dairy quotas on the basis that there was a clear opportunity for Irish agriculture to expand its production and to gain a greater percentage of both the European and global markets.This Green Paper is about product differentiation.  It is not about food quality or labelling in terms of the standard food labelling legislation.  These issues are already covered within comprehensive legislative tools and for that reason I will focus specifically on the areas in the Green Paper and deal with those because I suggest there are key issues we need to consider in this paper.I gather a copy of our presentation has been circulated and for time purposes it is important that I try to stay within the time allotted to us.  There is no need to reiterate the economic value of this sector.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	5	We will proceed on the basis of the printed version.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I will proceed on the basis that members have this information.  I have also circulated a policy paper.The value of this sector in total is approximately €16 billion and it has the potential to grow.  We are export oriented.  In general, 80% of what we produce is exported and we must focus on facilitating that.  We are the largest external supplier of food and drink to the United Kingdom market.  We produce approximately 13% of the world's powdered infant formula.  We are the largest net exporter of beef in Europe.  I could go on but the message is that we are export oriented and we need to facilitate that export orientation.There is a good deal of information on a standard label, and we have provided an example of a beef label in the pack.  Much of that information is governed and required by legislation but we must think about what the consumer is presented with.  One aspect of which we must be acutely aware is whether we are confusing the consumer by providing him with too much information.  It is all very well to say we want this and that on a logo but in terms of the food we want to see labelled we must consider the practicality of a weekly shop.  In the case of buying beef that is packed, it is welcome to see details on the cut of meat under that label.  There is a practicality in that respect.The Green Paper asks whether we need an EU quality logo but that quality logo is already on products.  It is the EU health mark, which means that product has been produced in compliance with an onerous level of legislative requirements.  That is important.  Rather than the provision of an additional EU quality logo, the EU has a role to promote and communicate to consumers the value of that logo.  It has been presented to us on many occasions in export markets that we are the people who have had the dioxin problem and foot and mouth disease.In one sense the transparency we provide in informing consumers and the public of what has happened in our industry has had a negative effect because there are those in foreign countries who focus only on the bad news.  Every time bad news is presented we must come out and promote that EU standard and quality to which we ascribe.  Rather than the development of an EU logo, IBEC's position is that we should promote the EU quality logo in an aggressive manner.Country of origin labelling is an emotive issue but it must be dealt with on a factual basis.  There are existing labelling regulations and they are sufficient.  The existing labelling regulations rightly allow for a sectoral approach to labelling.  We are in full agreement that the primary meat products should require country of origin labelling but a blanket approach should not be taken to all composite and dairy products.  It is highly inappropriate to demand country of origin labelling for mixed products.  That will stifle the investments we have made in food innovation in terms of products indigenous to this country and others.  That has resulted in the creation of a high value, high demand product which we have managed to market worldwide.  For example, we make a Hawaiian pizza in Ireland but we import the Parma ham or the pineapple.  We should not tie up this area in legislation.  We must consider other products such as that where we need imports.The other aspect of that is the growth in the development of the dairy sector.  The huge potential, as identified by the Commission, is in the development of fresh milk products but we are a seasonal producer and there are times in the year we will need to have products to retain the markets.  It is not good enough to invest in the creation of a market for fresh dairy products, walk away from it for four months of the year and expect to have that market still in situ.  There are times we will need to have the flexibility to retain these markets in which we have invested strongly.  That is the export orientation aspect.  The only other point I wish to add is that origin alone is not a differentiator.  The differentiator in terms of origin comes through certification schemes.Marketing standards are defined in this Green Paper and they are important in terms of those that are set at community, national and regional level.  Community level marketing schemes would be, say, the definition of milk.  That must be a definition with which every country in Europe agrees.  Milk should not be a term that can be used for soy products or drinks.  That is a standard that must be adhered to, addressed and set at a European level.An idea of a standard that must be set at a regional level but communicated in the EU is if we consider the European debate on mountainous regions.  A man living in the foothills of the Galtees will have a different view of mountainous regions from the man living in the foothills of the Alps.  There is a real need in this case for regional differentiation and definition of certain terms but that must be communicated and set within the community register of standards.  In that way we will get consistency and avoid potential devaluation that may arise from inconsistent use of these definitions.  We do that through guidelines created as a result of the input of all relevant stakeholders — producers, industry, consumers.  Guidelines can be binding and they are a key element of self-regulation, which is a principle that Food and Drink Industry Ireland strongly supports.It is important that we consider certification schemes for what they are.  A product or process is certified to differentiate it from the ordinary everyday products or processes in the marketplace.  In terms of the value of the cost and administration of it, if there is a value to the people participating in certification schemes, the cost is merited.  If it costs too much and producers or processors do not get a benefit from it, they will walk away from that certification scheme because it no longer has a value.  We cannot make it mandatory, however, and it would be wrong to make it mandatory because once that is done the ability to differentiate would be lost immediately.  If something is mandatory it is put in legislation because it is a requirement to which everybody should adhere.  For that reason, certification schemes must be left to the market to decide their value and application.  The one point we would make strongly, which we stated earlier, is that the EU must have a clear understanding of the definition of marketing standards and terms.  The EU has a role through its national bodies to ensure adherence and enforcement of those standards.Given the time allotted we did not deal with issues such as GI, other such factors and organic standards that are in the Green Paper.  We have referred to that in the position paper which I gather has been circulated.  Our position is that we must consider the real use of the label.  We must be balanced and not overload the label because that will defeat the purpose of educating consumers.In that regard, we must consider educating people at school level about what is stated on labels and the nutritional benefit.  A label will never take the place of an adequate education scheme.  Country of origin should always be provided when it is appropriate to do so.  It is not appropriate to apply country of origin labelling to composite products and products such as dairy but it is appropriate for primary meat products.Certification schemes must always comply with the marketing terms and definitions as set out by the Commission but they are market driven.  They are market differentiators and their value will be those that can be recovered from the marketplace.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I thank Mr. Barry.  We have had three interesting and important submissions.  I advise our guests that while members of the committee have absolute privilege, the same privilege does not apply to witnesses.Before calling on members to pose questions, the integrity of the food industry is hugely important to the economy.  I harbour a number of fundamental concerns with regard to labelling.  This is a major issue.  The integrity of the labelling system is greatly impacted upon by the degree of traceability attaching to it.  Food labels provide a huge amount of information.  If, however, any aspect of that information is either flawed or faulty, the label means nothing.  Other members and I have tabled literally thousands of parliamentary questions on the subject.As an exporter of food and food products, it is important that Ireland is able to identify, even in dairying, from where the constituent ingredients of such products come.  This is particularly important if a country is either importing or exporting mixed products or both.  If one is competing against exporters from other jurisdictions in which there is no requirement for products to comply with certain regulations, one is placed at a serious disadvantage in the marketplace.  The degree to which the country of origin of a product can be determined can provide a great deal of information on issues relating to husbandry, production and monitoring methods.  That is an extremely important point.Emergencies occasionally arise in Departments and the business sector.  Where the business of a well run organisation can be influenced by market fluctuations or quirks, however, the emergency must be anticipated before it arises.  Everyone present is aware of this fact.  The degree to which emergencies can be anticipated will determine the success or failure of an organisation and is important in the context of European and world food production.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I thank Mr. Deane, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Barry for their presentations.  They referred to the importance to Ireland of the food and drinks industry, which is valued at €16 billion.  During the past decade it has been overshadowed by other industries but there has been a recognition of the fact that it is Ireland's one really stable industry.  It is extremely important to our balance of payments because virtually all of the profits from it return to the country.  In real or practical terms, the actual value of the industry is greater than that of others.There is general agreement among members of the committee regarding food and agricultural issues.  I wish, however, to raise a number of points, the first of which relates to the production requirements relating to the IFA and the ICSA.  Can action be taken within the sector to improve the level of quality?  In the past the dairy herd had an impact on beef production and issues arose with regard to quality.  What can be done to improve the quality of beef?Regulation is a major issue for our guests.  In the light of the benefits that accrue, is the sector over-regulated?  After all, it costs money to implement every regulation.  If we were to reduce the number of regulations, which would be most likely to go?  I am familiar with the long inspection form one is required to complete.  One would become ill just looking at it.  In the context of the possible reduction in the number of regulations, recent events show that if strict controls are not in place, even a tiny blip can bring an entire industry to a standstill.  Is the pain worth the gain?People have different views on country of origin labelling.  The most important aspect of the matter is that labels should not be misleading.  I am not an expert on food content but when I see a label proclaiming that a product has a salt content of only 10%, I am inclined to be of the opinion that such a product would not be bad for me.  However, I do not know whether the claim is true.  A standard template is required in respect of labelling in order that people might know the truth.  I appreciate that it is necessary to have certain imported ingredients in particular products.  I cannot provide an answer to the quandary that arises in this regard.I understand farmers wanted full traceability in respect of pork.  Why was such traceability not introduced?What is the position on research and development in the food and drinks industry?  While I may be wrong, I believe the late Bernie Cahill came up with the concept for promoting Baileys Irish Cream.  Where stands the sector in respect of research and development?  Is it developing products to meet new needs?  How much money is invested in research and development?  When a new product has been developed, the most important matter thereafter is how it is marketed.  Many companies spend a great deal of money on marketing.  I raised this matter at our previous meeting and some were of the view that I was misleading the committee when I outlined my understanding that Bord Bia had one representative in the USA to service a market of 450 million people.  I accept that embassies, etc., have a role to play in this regard, but it is extraordinary that Bord Bia has only one representative in that territory.Are our guests of the view that the Government could play a greater role in promoting Irish food and drinks products?  Are there other channels — for example, the Department of Foreign Affairs — which could be utilised to a greater extent than is the case or would it be possible to encourage greater co-ordination in the marketing of products?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I welcome Mr. Deane, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Barry and thank them for their positive and focused contributions.  Mr. Barry made a particularly enlightened and detailed contribution.It is important that we all understand the key value of the finished product to the country.  The agrifood and drinks sectors have made a major contribution to our economic development.  Mr. Deane and Mr. Thompson, who represent the primary producers, are key players within these sectors.  When I served as Minister of State at the then Department of Agriculture and Food, we established a national body to examine what could be done, by means of the labelling process, in placing a special focus on the enhanced value and market penetration ability of the food sector.  Regrettably, we could not obtain the agreement of the various bodies involved.  When the final report on labelling was produced, a serious division emerged regarding the labels that could, in marketing Irish products within and outside Europe, be used to save and secure the future of the food industry.There is a need to simplify matters in this regard.  However, I am not sure how agreement might be reached in respect of labelling.  Ireland operates within the European Union, the population of which is 500 million and growing, and in the global market which is coming under ever-increasing pressure.  In that context, it is important that the country of origin of products, regardless of whether they emanate from within or outside the European Union, is clearly identified.  It will eventually be necessary to include EU and country of origin stamps on products.  That is the only way forward and it will improve Ireland's capacity to develop markets.Ireland has a natural advantage because there is so much grass on which animals can graze.  In addition, there is the regulation regime we have in place.  The latter is evidenced by the rapid response — albeit at great cost to the Exchequer and at lower cost to the European Union — to the dioxin crisis in December.  The Taoiseach is leading an extremely important trade mission to Japan.  The Japanese market is huge and has not yet been either fully explored or exploited by Ireland.  There is a great deal of goodwill in Japan towards Ireland and our countries have enjoyed almost two centuries of relations.  The Japanese authorities have acknowledged that the handling of the dioxin crisis by the Government and its organisations and agencies was of the highest standard and provided them with a high level of reassurance.  It shows how we protected our beef industry by having absolute traceability with a risk of only 0.2% as a result of the dioxins.  Following the actions taken in the pig sector, the Japanese Government and consumer have been assured.  I hope, therefore, following the trade mission, pork exports to Japan will increase.  The cost of beef in Japan is 500 times higher than in Ireland, although I am not sure what is the cost currently.  There is significant capacity for Ireland to increase its beef and pork exports.  The consumption of Irish drink products has also grown significantly and, I hope, that will continue.Taking all that into account, the global pressures, the regulatory regime in place, the need to address the lack of trust in the world in recent years which has led to the serious crisis we face, financially and otherwise, and the need for mobility in the movement of component products to create a finished product for the consumer, can the representatives assure us there is further capacity in primary production in the dairy, beef and sheep sectors and in processing to create more jobs for the global marketplace?  Is the regulatory regime impeding or assisting this?  What can the representative bodies and their counterparts across the European Union, in particular, do to ensure our market position is protected within the Union vis-á-vis imports to it?  How can all Europeans work together to ensure the market is expanded and protected while still playing our noble role in meeting global requirements resulting from the crisis affecting us?
#DeirdredeBurca	unknown-#DeirdredeBurca-party	unknown-#DeirdredeBurca-dob	unknown-#DeirdredeBurca-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I welcome the delegations and thank them for their presentations.  The responses to the issues raised in the European Union Green Paper were interesting.  There was a slight contradiction in the issues raised by the representatives of the farming organisations and those raised by Food and Drink Industry Ireland.  I would like Mr. Barry to clarify FDII's presentation.  He has made the point well that the food and drink industry accounts for a significant quantity of exports.  It is very much an export-led industry.  I did not realise it was responsible for two thirds of indigenous exports worth €8.6 billion in 2007, which is impressive.  In an export-led industry WTO and EU standards, legislative requirements and national standards and systems all come into play.  Mr. Barry argued for lighter regulation and suggested issues such as certification and quality standards were possible trade barriers.The other presentations referred to a number of players in the food sector, some of whom are primary producers such as those involved in the farming sector.  While many businesses in the sector add value, the consumer must also be considered.  When examining issues such as regulation and certification, the interests of all players, including primary producers and consumers, must be taken into consideration, not only those who add value and are more involved in trade.  I consider questions raised in the Green Paper with consumers and primary producers in mind as well as the interests of business.  Will Mr. Barry elaborate on the suggestion in FDII's submission that certification schemes have the potential to create trade barriers?  What concerns has the organisation in this regard?  Will he outline examples of ways in which certification schemes have acted as barriers to date?FDII does not accept the need for the introduction of an EU quality logo but the farming representatives raised the issue of higher standards with which their members must comply in various member states compared to the ones applying to agricultural products imported into the European Union.  There is a significant discrepancy and consumers are often not aware of the high quality standards required of EU farmers.  Would a quality logo not get around this problem?  FDII suggests the existing hygiene and safety standards are sufficient and that such a logo is not needed.  However, the quality logo would reflect the superior standards with which EU farmers must comply — not only in regard to hygiene and safety — which are not applied to non-EU agricultural products.  Consumers are often not aware of this.  I acknowledge Mr. Barry's comment that additional logos could be counterproductive and lead to issues regarding space, illegibility and confusion among consumers.  However, the advantage of a logo is that it is shorthand and the consumer could safely assume it represented an acceptable standard across a number of criteria and that they would not necessarily have to examine the fine print to seek significant information.  The logo could be shorthand for asserting the product had been produced according to quality standards across a range of criteria.FDII is also not very supportive of the introduction of a system of country of origin labelling.  Mr. Barry referred to the issue of composite products, the rigidity of country of origin labelling and the problem that would arise if a number of ingredients in a composite product were imported.  Could a flexible approach be taken to composite products?  For example, if a percentage of a product's ingredients were imported from another member state or region, that could be reflected on the country of origin label as opposed to adopting a requirement that all the constituent ingredients have to be sourced in the producer country.  Could a more flexible approach be taken to such labelling which would still allow consumers to identify where the majority of a product's ingredients were sourced?I refer to the issue of marketing terms such as low carbon food, grass-fed meat and so on.  The application of reserved terms and enhanced definitions and guidelines in this regard is important.  FDII largely favours self-regulation and the European Union's role as a producer rather than an enforcer of guidelines.  Traditionally, marketing terms such as GMO free, low carbon, free range and so on have been abused.  It is important guidelines are introduced and that there is a role for the EU in terms of enforcing those.  We are all aware of the dangers of leaving it entirely to industry to ensure guidelines are adhered to.  Perhaps Mr. Barry will state whether the FDII has any suggestions in this regard or if it agrees the EU should have a role in respect of the enforcement of such guidelines.I am disappointed the FDII is not in agreement with the requirement for the addition to the geographical indicators designation of a criteria in respect of sustainability.  I believe sustainability and consumer interest is growing in the degree to which a product is sustainable.  It would be unfortunate if the FDII were to resist the EU's consideration of introducing a more flexible approach to allowing consumers to become aware of the degree to which a product conforms with sustainability practices.  I would appreciate Mr. Barry's response on this matter.

There are four speakers remaining.  It is hoped we can take a short break before commencing the second phase of our meeting.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I will be brief.  I thank the delegation for meeting us and for outlining their position on these important issues.  We are in recession.  However, we must all still eat and drink.  While various industries, businesses and activities are downsizing, it is difficult to downsize people's need for two or three square meals and liquids every day.  This must be an area wherein there exists potential to maintain market size and to expand.  It is an area in respect of which I would expect the FDII, in terms of the recession, to come up with creative ideas.  I imagine it is an area on which the Government is focusing, namely, the greater return that possibly can be made from our food and drink industry in terms of production, exports and contribution to the Exchequer.  From that point of view, safety and quality are paramount.  The track record of product from farm to the fork has not been great to date.During the past two decades all our major food industries have been in danger of going under.  Our beef industry was almost ruined following the outbreak of mad cow disease and other incidents which I will not go into now though we were required to set up a tribunal on the matter.  It is not that long since that happened.  Our sheep industry was almost ruined by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, also not that long ago.  Last year, our pork industry was almost ruined as a result of the detection of dioxins in pork products.  We as human beings are very much what we eat.  It is important the animals we eat are fed proper ingredients to ensure they are not toxic in terms of the products which enter the chain for human consumption.Regulation and inspection is paramount.  I am opposed to light regulation.  There should be no such thing as light regulation.  In respect of the banks and financial industry, we were told for years to take a hands-off approach and to allow the sector to self-regulate.  We were told the big boys and girls would ensure the guidelines and code of conduct would be carefully observed.  We now know none of that was happening.  I firmly believe self-regulation does not work.  Where has been the inspection and regulation in the food industry?  I am sure the response I will receive is that we have a fine product.  That is universally acknowledged.  However, I believe that in every country in the world there is concern about this little Garden of Eden, this island which is separate from everyone else and which has the opportunity of producing top-class products.  It is no longer the case that we can claim that all products coming out of Ireland pose no danger in terms of quality.  We must ensure this situation does not deteriorate.  Light regulation must be a thing of the past.  We must ensure stringent inspection and regulation of the farm product and the ingredients used in the production of that product.My second point relates to consumers.  What is it that we are looking for when examining an item on the supermarket shelf?  I must confess I consider only three issues, namely, that the product is what it pertains to be, the shelf life of the product and the country of origin, first in terms of whether it an Irish product and, if not, whether it is a European product.  Customers seldom read the ingredients of a product.  Often the print is so small one has to squint to read it.  People are genuinely happy to purchase a product when he or she has identified it as Irish.  People often will also examine the branding on products in terms of whether they are Denny, Galtee, Clonakilty and so on.  I heard recently that the some of the product of Galtee rashers is produced elsewhere.  Branding provides customers with reassurance.  I believe reassurance will come from the labelling of products with the Irish and European logos.  They will be the determinants of quality.  I favour the use of those two forms of labelling, despite the questions that have arisen in this regard and in terms of the right of people to import ingredients.  We must ensure high standards are put in place and adhered to.  Obviously, standards in Ireland are based on Irish law and European Union standards are based on European law, in which we have a say.My final comment relates to marketing and whether we should expand in this area.  To expand the market requires branding.  Bailey's Irish Cream is a great market brand and is a product that is sold worldwide.  It is an Irish brand.  I believe there is scope for branding in terms of quality.  One associates a particular brand with quality.  Products that come to mind are Clonakilty pudding, Galtee cheese and Kerrygold butter.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Tullamore sausages.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	15	How could I forget Tullamore sausages and Tullamore Dew?  We have been successful at branding in some areas and hopeless in other areas.  Our greatest product is beef.  Approximately 56% of our food exports is Irish beef, which is not branded in any way.  If we can brand Irish butter, why can we not brand Irish beef?  Why are we exporting such a large quantity of Irish beef without proper branding?One of the presentations referred to milk, milk powder, butter and soya products.  I have heard representatives of the IFA and farmers say many times that we are totally dominated by the milk quota.  The milk quota relates only to milk that feeds into the milk chain.  All the by-products of milk, such as milk powder and butter, could be part of the industry.  The industry has a variety of by-products that could be marketed and used outside the EU milk quota.  The milk used in these by-products should not be related to the EU quota as long as it is used as an ingredient in other products.  Is there a connection between the milk quota and these products?  Farmers say they have only got such a quota and that is the maximum they can produce.  Can they not produce milk for other purposes?  Could they not produce more for Bailey's Irish Cream or for local cheese products such as craft cheeses?  Is there a total limit to production of milk?  If that is the case, can something be done about it?
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I welcome the delegations.  I agree with Deputy Costello that we need a logo that is close to home and that we should have country of origin labelling.  We should have a logo for produce from outside the European Union and rather than saying something is an EU product, labels should describe products from outside of the Union as being non-EU products.I understand that beef imported here from Argentina and Brazil comes from accredited herds.  However, some farms that feed into the accredited herds are not controlled at all.  We do not know what kind of feed those animals get or whether they get hormones, but their meat is channelled through the accredited herds into the European Union.  This is the reason we should use labelling to highlight non-EU products.  Will the delegates elaborate on this area?  The logo on beef coming from Brazil or Argentina should highlight this by identifying the product as a non-EU one.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I welcome the delegates.  No other matter has given rise to so much worry and concern as the issue of what animals are fed and what ultimately comes through to us as food.  From time to time a scare is raised about this and, no doubt about it, the seemingly rapid increase in particular forms of cancer has led people to believe that this must be a result of something animals are fed.  We have all heard this and whether it is folklore, what animals are fed is a cause of concern for people and they wonder what can be done about it.  The issues being discussed by this committee today are important for consumers and people concerned about not just their own health, but that of children.  What will the outcome be if such scare stories continue to arise?  We hear people say that long ago they did not hear such stories or people did not get these diseases.  Perhaps this was because animals did not feed on such a variety of foodstuffs as they do now.  The situation is a serious concern.I agree with Deputy Joe Costello that light regulation is no longer adequate or fashionable.  Thank the Lord for that.  I have sat around many a Cabinet table where light regulation was the mantra of the day.  Light regulation has been given its goodbye and a kick in the backside.  That is what it should have got from all.  We can see how light regulation has messed up the American financial scene and, consequently, that of all other countries following sub-prime lending.  Sub-prime lending arose as a result of light regulation.  I know this is going off the point.  People who proposed heavier regulation some years ago were deemed interventionists or socialists, etc., and were certainly not considered modern.  However, now it is the modern thing to call for heavy regulation.  This is amazing.  I am for heavy regulation.I would like to pick up on the concerns raised by Mr. Barry about country of origin.  He also pointed out the clear need for consumer education.  Consumers have become more aware.  I would remind Deputy Costello that as well as looking for the sell-by date — the first thing I look at — they also look at the price.  Deputy Costello does not seem to give a damn what something costs; he must be a great shopper.  I would love to have him to send out to do the shopping.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I was talking about quality.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Sell-by date, price and country of origin should be on labels.  On the issue of consumer education, there is no doubt consumers want to know more, as witnessed on the Monday after the dioxin scare when consumers collectively opened their freezers and dumped whatever pork products were found in them.  People did this because they were scared of what might happen them.  To some extent consumers have been educated, but not enough.  They were not educated in the detail.Consumer education should be part of the CSPE programme at junior certificate level.  At one time it was supposed to become part of the curriculum and pupils were supposed to learn how to get a mortgage — although there is little point in learning that now because they will not get one — how to approach the bank manager, how to approach the county council and about consumer matters.  Nowadays, the consumer matters, which is a significant advance.  Ten years ago consumers were hardly mentioned by farmers.  I never heard farmers use the word consumer.  The consumer was someone who paid up and never asked questions, but was supposed to be delighted to get the product.  I have been a consumer all my life and know well that was the way consumers were treated.  I am happy there is now a growing awareness and emphasis on the rights of consumers and on the need for consumers to get more in-depth education than currently.We are meant to be reassured when we see the tricolour, the sell-by date and the price.  We say "Oh good, this is Irish", but is it?  Is that labelling enough to tell us a product is Irish?  I do not know what seal of final approval should be on produce so that consumers can be convinced.  We have a wealth and luxuriance of consumer products to sell.  Thankfully, the days are gone when a "Made in France" label was enough to convince people the product must be terrific.  Why should that be the case?  I am quite sure France has all sorts of stains with regard to things that went wrong as well, but we do not hear much about them.On his radio show this morning, Ryan Tubridy was getting feedback from people in radio and television around the world about what they thought of Ireland.  One guy from Austin, Texas, was very good.  He said the impression used to be that Ireland was green fields, waving trees and happy cows, but that has been stained by the numerous food scares that have come out of Ireland.  I was amazed by what this person, who seemed a responsible type of person, had to say.  We are at the brink of consolidating our fine products and getting a seal of approval that is understandable, clearly marked and something in which the consumer will have trust.  We have a long way to go on that.This has been a helpful debate and I am fascinated by the different views of people.  I hope that things develop further following this debate.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I welcome all the people present.  I agree with the speakers who spoke specifically on labelling and regulation.  I would like to see the Irish quality mark on the label and I would welcome a European standard.  If I was going to buy a watch and was told that it was made in Europe I would be glad, but if I was told it was made in Switzerland, I would be twice as glad.  I feel the same way about Irish food products, and this is where regulation comes in.We know that chicken comes  in from Thailand, is basted or breaded here, and then "Irish" appears on the label.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	21	A flag.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Yes, we see a flag.  That is misleading in such a context.  If an Irish branded product is used for this, such as a household name like Cappoquin, which people associate strongly with Ireland, there should be a strong label indicating that the place of origin is Thailand.  The concept of "outside the EU" is very important, especially at the moment with the difficulties associated with the transit of gas through Ukraine.  Relying on an outside source creates a huge problem.  We do not have to go back further than this week, and certainly not back to the Greek city states, who had problems getting their grain from Pontus, which was the Ukraine of the time.I would like to see the EU with a sufficient supply in the bloc itself.  As part of that, Ireland should be at the forefront of quality, clean food.  Within that again, there should be quite clear subsections.  If somebody wishes to have non-GM food, then he or she should be able to access it.  If somebody wants to have organic food, they should be able to access that.  The wealthy customer in Europe who is prepared to pay more for quality Irish products should be able to see that they are getting them.  In Ireland, the fuchsia brand for west Cork has raised awareness.  If we are to have an EU label at an international level, we must also have Irish quality beside it in the same way a Swiss watch means so much more than just a European watch.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I will be very brief, because most of the points have been raised and have been well aired at this stage.  I welcome the three delegations and I thank them for their presentations.  As representatives of both sides of the industry, namely, farming and food production, have they ever got together to work out what is in the best interests of both groups?  It seems that if they sat down and worked out what was best from an Irish perspective, it might be helpful for us.The one group we are missing today is Bord Bia, which has a role in marketing the produce of these groups before us.  That body would have a better understanding of the market requirement.  We like to believe food is produced at home.  We have the greatest trust in our own farmers and our own producers, and we like the idea of the flag on the label.  I am not too sure if the Irish flag on beef sold in France is particularly important.  From visiting other countries, Irish meat products are not on the top shelf.  They are largely on the bottom shelf.  This is as result of an effort made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to rationalise the animal slaughter sector, to bring about less of the competition that is leading to a race to the bottom.  A more focused approach needs to be taken to the product to bring it up to the top shelf on the international markets.There are two elements to this.  On the home market, the association with the Irish flag is vitally important.  We must look at how we generate the image of Ireland, which is where Bord Bia would be helpful.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We will now hear a short response from our contributors.  The points made by members of the committee are points in which they believe sincerely, from their own working knowledge as members of the Oireachtas, and from dealing with the consumer sector, the processing sector and so on.A number of main points have emerged.  When manufacturing pizza here, either for the Irish market or for export, the ingredients must come into account.  Whether the product is mixed or not, the origins of those ingredients will in some way determine the world-wide image of the product on the market.  Deputy O'Rourke stated that "made in France" is supposed to stand for something.  It stands for something because there is a belief that such a label has integrity.  Senator John Hanafin mentioned a Swiss watch.  Why do people prefer a Swiss watch as opposed to a general European watch or any other watch?  They do so because a Swiss watch implies quality of origin and quality of production.In a previous incarnation, I had responsibility in Opposition for the food sector.  About 25 years ago, we tried to introduce a gold label for food production.  Members of the IFA were anxious to do it, although not everybody was anxious to do it.  When costs increase, including the cost of ingredients, there is a tendency to draw on areas that have lower costs and possibly lower standards.  In a food producing country, that is a dangerous route to follow.  It is very damaging to the product, to the country and to the international image of the country, and it cannot be repaired.  We cannot afford to allow emergencies arise in this area.Ingredients were all produced at home 40 years ago, so nobody imported any cheap ingredients from any quarter.  It was easy to trace such ingredients.  However, I have not been happy for some time with the manner in which country of origin labelling occurs, and with the degree to which products can be sold here with an integrity that they do not deserve.  Unless we recognise that, we are wasting our time in trying to compete on an international market.  French, Spanish and Italian wines are deemed to be quality products, whether we like it or not.  They have established their place on the market.  If somebody wants a quality product, they look for these types of produce.Organic and general production can go hand in hand.  If the whole sector was organic, we would lose much production.  However, that does not mean that we should go in the opposite direction and dilute the quality of our products by introducing additives and growth promoters as others have done.The consumer must be catered for.  While I apologise for discussing this issue at length, I consider it important and it is one on which the joint committee will make a report to the European Commission, in which the views of members will be expressed clearly.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	25	On a point of information, does the Chairman intend to deal with the second item on the agenda before the break?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	26	No, we will deal with it after the break.  After finishing with this item, we will have a short break of 20 to 30 minutes.  Thereafter, we will deal with the second item, which pertains to Gaza.  I call on Mr. Deane to respond on behalf of the IFA.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I certainly welcome the Chairman's comments, which reflected well on the situation.  The real issue is one of equivalence of standards, which is the only thing on which we can compete.  We have no difficulty in improving the quality of both our product and our breeding.  While such improvements undoubtedly can be made, equivalence of standards constitutes the major issue in this regard.  I must disagree with my friends from the food and drink industry on the issue of labelling and transparency.  It must be transparent and unquestionably must be what it says on the tin.  Moreover, we must worked towards this aim.  On the issue of processing and the Irish market, we should seek to promote Irish production and the Irish product, rather than the cheapest possible source of raw material available globally.  For reasons I pointed out earlier, the cheapest possible products come from areas in which a much lower standard of production obtains, which is extremely important.  The issues of transparency and labelling must be addressed.As for Deputy Costello's comments, we undoubtedly can increase our production.  Ireland needs to increase its food production and to get a quality product with a quality price into the European market to a greater extent.  We must build on the strength of Ireland's quality label.  We also must be extremely careful to avoid being taken apart by side issues, such as greenhouse gases, in respect of which some people have suggested that Ireland should undertake a major cut in its production herds.  This simply would lead to an increase in production in other countries, as well as Ireland being taken out in respect of competition.I agree with the statement made by the Chairman and I look forward to the joint committee's deliberations on this issue.  Transparency of label is of critical importance to both the consumer and the producer and we must try to deal with it through the joint committee and in this White Paper.  The issues must be dealt with on that basis because transparency is the real issue in the future.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I will try to deal with the questions briefly.  First, Deputy Timmins asked whether quality can be improved and yes, it certainly can.  The beef forum, of which we are members at present, is considering how to reward quality production and different qualities of meat.  Historically, it all has been lumped into a single basket and a flat price has been paid for cattle.  This probably is a way in which to go forward.  Deputy Timmins also asked whether we are over-regulated and I believe we probably are not.  It is highly important that regulations are in place but when they become redundant, such as in the BSE situation, they should be got rid of as rapidly as they were introduced.  This was delayed for many years at huge cost to farmers.Deputy Treacy mentioned the grass-based system and asked whether there is room for expansion.  Of course there is room for expansion in Ireland.  While regulations such as the nitrates directive are limiting our expansion somewhat, I believe there is a global shortage of beef and we should be encouraged to farm in an environmentally-friendly way, while simultaneously expanding our production in order that we are able to meet the food demands of the world as the green island of Ireland.  Thankfully, Senator de Búrca was easy on me so I have nothing to say about her.  Deputy Costello referred to the importance of regulations.  Basically, all the other speakers tend to agree wholeheartedly with our point about labelling, that is, the consumer now is extremely important.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned the consumer and noted she had not heard farmers talking about consumers ten years ago.  Of course we were but the Deputy simply was not listening to farmers.  We always were talking about the consumer because we always were trying to see where we could make a pound.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Yes, that is for sure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	30	We always were aware of the consumer and it is important to analyse consumer trends.  For example, while I may consider that standard production of cattle is perfectly adequate for me, some consumers want organic product.  While I may consider that standard production of cattle is fine, some consumers want product that is free of GMOs.  We must cater for the tastes of those people who will pay an extra few pounds and shillings for such add-on.  Moreover, this must be labelled clearly, together of course with the Irish label.  Perhaps we should get away from the flag and move to a map of Ireland, because the latter is better known.  As the Irish flag is practically identical to the Italian flag, the map of Ireland would be better.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	31	That is a good point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I recognise there are time constraints and will be brief.  One point must be made clear from the outset.  I believe everyone is on the same page in respect of the desired destination.  However, there have been differing emphases in the various presentations.  We have stuck entirely to the context of the Green Paper.  As we have stated from the outset and noted in our position paper, issues of food safety, labelling, traceability and import certification are outside the scope of the Green Paper.  They are huge mission-critical issues and I have heard sufficient concern expressed at this meeting to merit further discussion on these issues, in which we would be happy to participate.  However, while they are key issues, they are outside the scope of the Green Paper and in not dealing with them, we were not lessening their importance.  For example, reference was made to light regulation.  The food and drink industry, which extends back to the producers, is the most heavily regulated industry in existence.  Even if one speaks about labelling——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I will interrupt for a second.  To better explain members' perspectives, we know about the Green Paper and are familiar with the purpose of the exercise.  The members' points reflect their wishes as to what the Green Paper should encompass, as opposed to what was applicable heretofore.  This is the important factor.  The food industry must take on board that the views expressed by members reflect the views held by consumers and producers and perhaps even those of processors, albeit not to the same extent.  The processors operate between the consumers and the producers, which is the reason it is important that the standards which are applied to the producer and are expected by the consumer also are applicable to the wedge that is in between.  I can make the point no more simply.  The views expressed by members of the committee do not constitute an attempt to make life difficult for anyone.  They simply are trying to explain the extent to which they believe the regulations now should be focused and how they should be applied in the future without risk to any of the groups concerned.  I apologise for the interruption.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The entire food and drink industry would not have achieved its present scale and would not have been so successful in export markets had it not understood the wishes and requirements of consumers globally, domestically and on a European basis.  This is a major factor in this regard and is the reason those present are not a million miles apart in respect of the endgame.Some other issues arise.  Due to the manner in which we have differentiated on country of origin labelling, there is a perception that we have opposed it.  This is not the case and our point was clear.  Country of origin labelling is appropriate for primary meat production.  We support it and it is something that our members do.  There are some areas of confusion in this regard, which have been referred to at this meeting, and at present we are working to ensure they are addressed at both national and European level.  We are acutely aware of this issue because of the relationship it has to other issues.  This is a priority for the meat sector.  Within other areas of the food sector, such as the dairy sector or consumer foods, different concerns and considerations arise.  Country of origin labelling would not suit or enable the expansion and development of that sector.  It would not allow our producers to grow.  Different things are required at sectoral level, as country of origin labelling would be appropriate in some sectors, but not in others.  In this way, the sector in question will expand.

If a product contains Parma ham, it is supposed to come from one place.  That is simple.  It could be pepperoni.  I am not an expert on pizzas, but I have consumed a few.

Everyone claims to know about them now.  If I do not have confidence in the procedures and practices in the country of origin of a product containing Parma ham, I will have no confidence in the product.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	38	We have been clear in stating that the origin, as stated in labelling regulations, must always be provided where it would be misleading not to do so.  This has always been and will continue to be our position, for which reason we are putting significant resources into working with national and European authorities to remove the elements of ambiguity being brought to the fore continually.  This must be done if the markets and Ireland as a quality brand are to be developed at a European and global level.  There is no disagreement in this regard.It would be wrong to make country of origin labels mandatory on products such as dairy.  We are considering a European document.  The same debate is ongoing in 26 other states.  We export 80% of our cheese, for example, and compete against countries that use their own flags for the reason referred to by Deputy Dooley, namely, renationalisation.  This is the reason Irish beef is at a different shelf level than French beef.  When the French have an equivalent discussion and say that they want to renationalise and to have country of origin labelling, we must bear in mind that a blanket approach devalues the Irish product in its export market.  Of every ten bullocks, eight are exported from the island.  Of every ten dairy cows, the milk of approximately 8.5 of these is exported.  In the absence of quotas, the latter figure will increase as we increase production.  If we want a sustainable and expanding agricultural sector, which we have thanks to our natural advantages, we must ensure our ability to market our products in European and global markets.Regarding imports of standards lower than ours, the distrust of some products is correct.  We need imports to enable exports of a more diverse nature.  However, if an Irish entity uses products that are below the standards applied to its own, only it will fall.  For that reason, import standards must be more strongly enforced within the context of the WTO.  While people opposed the WTO and wanted to do away with it, its role is to enforce standards.  We need a strong and effective WTO so as to ensure that standards are not enforced willy-nilly or in such a way as to act as a trade barrier, which everyone agrees would be unacceptable.I will address the other points briefly.  Some suggested that it would be appropriate to go beyond the EU health mark, but an EU quality logo would be a duplication of that mark.  If food is not produced, processed, transported and exported to a certain standard, it will not get the mark.  Europe must promote this fact.  What tests would be applied to food to warrant a quality logo?  Would they not be the same tests as those applied under the EU health mark system?  We have spent much time discussing the administrative burdens associated with regulation and heavy regulation.  Bureaucracy works against our competitiveness in the global market and needless bureaucracy will not benefit anyone at any level of the industry.  Therefore, I question the merit of creating a duplicate system.  The EU health mark is the quality logo and must be promoted and explained.  If one does not have it, one does not have a quality product.We did not suggest that sustainability was unimportant.  It is quite important and we have a strong position on carbon measuring and the sustainability of food production, processing and transportation.  It is not a geographical indicator, GI.  Rather than being limited to a single area, it must be applied across the whole of the food chain.  It is being addressed under the EU climate change package in which we are involved.  It is a considerable challenge for everyone.  The principle is right, as the situation must be managed to avoid a cost that cannot be absorbed by the sector, but keeping it under a GI would not be appropriate.  This would suggest that sustainability should only apply in minute regions whereas a sustainability criteria must apply to the 27 member states in an equal and harmonised manner to avoid competitive imbalances.  We must be aware of this fact.Deputy Costello is in favour of heavier regulation, but not industry guidelines or self-regulation.  He also referred to the success of Baileys Irish Cream as a brand.  The success of the Irish cream liqueur has been based on the industry's agreed guideline, the Irish cream liqueur standard.  This is a practical example of an EU standard that has worked, but what we have stated as regards standards——

The equivalence of standards must be addressed at EU level and through strong regulation.  There is no uniformity of standards.  Even entities such as the US and the EU differ on equivalence in certain areas.  This matter must be developed further, particularly in a globalised world.  In this way, we will protect our export sector for everyone's betterment.

It was an informative debate.  I do not agree with some of the views expressed by Mr. Barry.  Indeed, I profoundly disagree with them, as do some committee members.  I do not refer to the bias in the presentation.  There are three segments, the producer, the consumer and those in between.  If all are not singing from the one hymn sheet we do not make any difference.  It is like the Swiss watch and French products.  The integrity of the products is important, the label means nothing.  Years ago, when I examined the question of a gold standard label, I realised the label is only as good as the standard.  If the standard is not applicable, the label means nothing.We mentioned the Irish flag, the Swiss watch and French wine and other products.  The points the witnesses made were valid but I am concerned, having listened to the views expressed by the members of the committee as consumers as well as public representatives of producers and processors.  There are representatives of processors on this committee.  The issues raised must be borne in mind in the review taking place in the context of the Green Paper.  If that does not happen we will revisit situations where there are emergencies or matters we did not foresee.  Members are trying to foresee these issues.Ms Westbrook did not have the opportunity to contribute.

There is a separate motion in the name of Deputy Costello.  There is a further motion in the name of Senator Doherty.  However, that motion cannot be moved because the Senator is not in attendance.  The motions will be the subject matter of the discussion.  It is proposed, with the committee's agreement, to move the motion and the amendment simultaneously.  The motion in Deputy Costello's name will be moved separately, if necessary and advisable.  Alternatively, I give members the option of agreeing a composite motion incorporating the sentiments expressed in all the motions in so far as such a motion can be accommodated unanimously.  It would be greatly beneficial if that could be done.Having viewed on screen the debate at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on Tuesday, this is a serious issue that requires to be treated with great seriousness and respect.  It affects a very sensitive area in the Middle East and the lives and livelihoods of the people there.  We in this country are in a unique position, from our unfortunate experiences, to be able to make a positive contribution.  I ask members to be temperate and moderate in the views they express, as it would be of no benefit to either side to the conflict in the Middle East if we were to add more fuel to the fire.  As members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, we have a particular and specific responsibility as regards the Middle East arising from EuroMed, the European Union's association with Israel and the various trade agreements in place.  It is important we keep these matters in mind during the debate.I ask Deputy Mulcahy to move his motion and Deputy Timmins to move his amendment.  The two will be debated simultaneously.  I wish the debate to be objective, helpful and supportive.  Therefore, I will rule out of order anything that appears to be in any way abrasive or insulting to either party involved in the Middle East.

While my motion is separate, in elements it is not unrelated.  Unless we are to go over the same arguments again, all speakers could refer to my motion in the debate in order that we would not have to spend the second period going through the same elements.

If I can make out the signature correctly, it was signed by Dick Spring, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, and implemented when Deputy Brian Cowen, the current Taoiseach, was Minister for Foreign Affairs.As the Chairman noted, it is part of the European neighbourhood policy of Euromed.  I am one of the people on my side of the House who regularly attends Euromed meetings.  It is a very good process and I believe we should strengthen ties, not just with Israel, but with all the countries around the Mediterranean basin.  It is a very worthwhile project.  Members have had the agreement circulated, which is about co-operation and trade.  It deals with close trade and is presumed to be beneficial to both parties.  It is a binding international agreement and is probably justiciable in the European and other international courts if there is a breach.At the moment there are negotiations between the European Union and Israel for a new upgraded agreement.  This is relevant as Article 82 states that the agreement is concluded for an unlimited period.  Until this agreement is amended, it appears to continue in force.  Each of the parties may denounce the agreement — I presume this means terminate the agreement — by notifying the other party.  The agreement shall cease to apply six months after the date of such notification.Interestingly, Article 2 of this association agreement states:Relations between the parties, as well as all the provisions of the agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this agreement".That is very interesting wording and I am sure lawyers of many descriptions could spend years, if not decades, arguing over precisely what that means.  We are public representatives and are entitled to use our common sense to interpret this.  At the end of the day, this is a political document as well as being a legal document.  It is quite clear respect for human rights must be an essential part of the agreement.  It is interesting that it is put in Article 2 rather than at the back of the agreement.  It is put right at the front so it is obviously meant to constitute an essential part.We move on from there to the United Nations.  For a number of years we have been seeing many reports from the United Nations indicating that the rights of the Palestinians are being consistently breached by the Israelis.  I will quote sources, although I will not go into it at length.  I do not need to go into the rights and wrongs of the current events in Gaza.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	70	There are no rights.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I am relying on the United Nations for my sources.  I will quote in outline the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, by Mr. John Dugard.  It relates to a Human Rights Council meeting of 21 January 2008.  He makes it quite clear there have been breaches of human rights.  I will quote from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navanethem Pillay, in her report of 28 December 2008.Recently, on 9 January 2009, the UN Human Rights Council, a body I confess I had never heard of, met in special session and passed a resolution.  I will ask my good friend Deputy Dooley, who has seconded the motion, to hand that around to my colleagues.  The resolution made it absolutely clear that there had been violations of the human rights of Palestinians by the Israelis.  This is not my opinion.  I am simply quoting United Nations sources.  High-up and respected people are singing the same tune consistently.  I do not have to get into the rights and wrongs of it; I am simply relying on my United Nations sources.  With regard to the vote of the Human Rights Council, it is interesting to note that the motion was passed with 33 in favour, one against and 13 abstentions, the latter representing the major industrialised nations of Europe — France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — while countries such as India, China and Russia voted in favour of the motion.  I am not sure whether we get the right picture of what is happening on this issue at European Council level.  There appears to be a Euro club and at some stage we need to get underneath that.In light of these United Nations reports, there is a prima facie case for a breach of Article 2, although I am not saying it is conclusive.  Given that we have, along with our sister committee the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, an obligation to scrutinise all international agreements concerning the European Union and neighbouring countries, this committee should initiate a process of scrutinising all aspects of EU-Israel association agreements — not just the 1995 agreement but any other agreement contemplated.  There are two objectives to such scrutiny.  One is to improve Israel’s adherence to human rights and international law.  That is the objective of a neighbourhood policy — to improve the standards of neighbouring societies.  If we take into account the fact that Israel has developed nuclear weapons outside of the international community, the building of the barrier — which has been condemned by the International Court of Justice — and the situation in Gaza, which has been criticised by the United Nations, it does not seem that Israel is according the matter of human rights the status it should have.  As for the second objective, it is a question of standards.  I do not believe it is appropriate for the EU to have association agreements with any country that does not measure up to the correct human rights standards.  That is a basic principle, whether we are talking about Israel or any other country.  If we have association agreements with countries that do not put human rights at the top of the agenda, we are debasing our own currency as a civilisation.  We cannot afford to do this and we should not do it.We should begin this process.  I have a totally open mind on it.  I am not a spokesperson for either party.  In most of these cases there are rights and wrongs on both sides.  However, our foreign policy is by and large led by the United Nations.  We respect the United Nations and we must take cognisance of its reports.  That is why I have drafted this motion.  In due course, it would be useful to hear testimony from the following people — representatives of the UN, the EU; both sides in the current conflict; the Minister for Foreign Affairs; perhaps the Taoiseach or former Deputy Dick Spring, who were there at the initiation of this agreement and may be able to tell us the importance attached by the negotiators to Article 2 at the time; and, in view of all this expert testimony, a legal opinion.  This is also a legal document, and we need to inquire, in light of all these transgressions, whether there has been a breach of Article 2.As you can see from the wording of the motion, Chairman, it is non-discriminatory.  It does not allege any wrongdoing by anybody.  It simply says that this issue should be investigated.  If I may address the amendment put down by Deputy Timmins, there is much sense in part of it, in which he states that we should invite the European Union Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, Ms Benita Ferrero-Waldner.  I have drafted an amendment to my own motion which would add the following words after the word "representative" in the fourth line — "and the European Union Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy and any other persons which this committee deems necessary".  That gives it a broad enough scope to include everybody.  I disagree with part B of Deputy Timmins's motion.  We cannot put any agreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and the EU on the same scale.  The PLO is not a state so we are not comparing like with like.  No reports have been brought to my attention from the United Nations to the effect that the PLO has been guilty of human rights violations.  If there are such reports, and Deputy Timmins wants to table those reports, perhaps we should consider it.I do not think it is fair to say that my motion is one-sided.  I might well conclude at the end of this process that Israel is not in breach of Article 2 of the association agreement.  I have an open mind.  We should all have an open mind — in light of the Chairman's comments, this is very important.  We want the truth and we want integrity in this process.  I genuinely believe that the best way to kick off the process, with all due respect to Deputy Timmins, is to accept that I have incorporated the most important part of his amendment into my motion and to proceed with inviting the UN representative, followed by the EU representative and then other witnesses as deemed necessary, to appear before the committee.  I thank the Chairman for his time and ask the committee to consider supporting the motion.

I have spent the last year advocating Europe and explaining how Europe has been good for us and for our European neighbours.  I would not like people to think there is a cosy club of industrialised European states.  That is something on which we should seek a view if the Minister for Foreign Affairs comes before the committee.  I am not privy to what happens at Council meetings other than from the reports I have seen.With respect to Deputy Mulcahy's motion, I agree with virtually all of what he said, apart from his last comment about part B of our motion.  I appreciate the comments made by the Chairman at the beginning and I do not want to rehash the full debate, but this is not a case of right or wrong.  It is a case of rights and wrongs in general, and to criticise one side should not be seen as support for the other.  We in Fine Gael have adopted a moderate, middle-of-the-road line on this.  Over the past 12 to 18 months, when there have been difficulties in the Gaza Strip, irrespective of what side they were on, we have issued statements, although they may not always have received coverage.  During the current crisis, the moderate line has not received much coverage, while the extremes have, be it in the letters pages of the newspapers or in other areas of the media.  There is no solution to be found at the extremes.  It will never be solved until everyone moves to a middle-ground position.  While I do not want to bore the committee, it is important to outline that Fine Gael would like to see the immediate adoption of UN Resolution 1860, which proposes an end to the current conflict, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, a cessation of the Hamas rocket attacks and the facilitation of humanitarian assistance through the border crossings.  In broader terms we favour a two-state solution, a return to pre-1967 borders unless amended by agreement by the two parties, an agreed solution to the Palestinian refugees who left their homes in 1948 and 1967, and Israel ceasing settlement activities and dismantling all outposts erected since March 2001.  It is important to put that on the record again.To achieve this all Palestinians must cease all acts of violence and commit to peace.  We also recognise Israel's right to protect its citizens from attacks.  However, in doing so it must act within international law.  While I welcome Deputy Mulcahy's motion, with which I have no difficulty, he quite rightly makes the argument that it is not possible to hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for what is happening in Gaza and questions whether it is responsible for Hamas or not.  He is quite justified in asking that question.  I cannot recall whether the Joint Committee for European Affairs had a similar motion regarding the South African ambassador relating to the difficulties in Zimbabwe.  I will not list the litany of other countries we have discussed where we could have called in ambassadors.  Perhaps it is not a bad thing for us to take such a proactive approach.  I would hope that we might conduct a more consistent role in highlighting the difficulties.I will concentrate on Gaza because if that conflict was not happening at the moment, these motions would not be before the committee.  The acts have been deplorable.  The killing of innocent children and the indiscriminate reckless attacks on positions in Gaza by the Israelis are deplorable, as are the activities of Hamas, which uses the cover of civilian areas to launch attacks.  I am conscious that from the fog of war the truth takes a long time to win out.  However, from this remove, I would be reasonably certain that both sides have broken the Geneva Convention and international law.  Time will probably prove that to be the case.I also agree with much of Deputy Costello's motion.  One must condemn the wanton killing.  There are two sides, although in the Gaza conflict it is very much weighted in favour of the Israelis.  It should not be interpreted as passive acceptance of what is happening there, which is not the case.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach will use every channel open to them to relay the concern of Irish people and take the necessary steps to get our message across.  Deputy Costello has informed me that he will mention something about Hamas.  However, his motion all comes down on one side.  Irrespective of who is right and who is wrong — in my view both are right and both are wrong — tabling a motion that is clearly in favour of one or the other would do nothing to assist the situation.This issue is the most emotive issue I have come across in the foreign affairs area.  One of the difficulties I have with it is that almost everyone who deliberates on it is on one side or the other.  I do not know the extent of the middle ground, if it exists in this country, but I am certainly in the middle ground, as is my party.  However, during times of conflict the middle ground view is generally suppressed, as evidenced by the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs the previous day.  The moderate middle ground view did not get any airing.  It is the only view that will solve this problem.I served in Lebanon.  I encountered the Israelis and the south Lebanese army at first hand.  I saw what they did and know what they are capable of doing.  I saw Mossad in operation.  I saw its people come in, blow up homes and kidnap people.  Israeli-backed forces and, indeed, the IDF itself have murdered members of the Irish peacekeeping group in the UNIFIL operation in Lebanon, just as many of the Arab terrorist groups have murdered members of the Irish forces.  I have seen the use of women and children as human shields, done with wanton disregard for children.  Neither side on this conflict has a monopoly on concern for children.  Both sides have no regard for innocent children, as evidenced by the attacks on Gaza and the rockets fired on Israel with many innocent people terrorised.  People need not tell me about the rights and wrongs.  I will not go down the road of developing the thing from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs meeting of the previous day.  However, if I need to come back in on it, I will do so.I believe my motion gives a balanced approach.  I mentioned the European Union Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy because, in the first instance, she should deliver on an EU-based agreement.  I do not have any difficulty with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights or anyone else expressing a view to the committee.  It would be a very good idea.  This committee could consider setting up a forum, perhaps not as extensive as the sub-committee investigating Ireland's future in the EU.  That may be something we should consider in the months ahead, preferably in the atmosphere of a ceasefire which I hope will come in the next few days.  We could set up a forum in this committee and invite various people.  If we cannot come up with some middle ground and a unanimous position removed from the heat of conflict, destruction and death, how can we expect groups at the coalface to have any semblance of understanding or common ground?I ask Deputy Mulcahy to consider our amendment, which is tabled in the best interests of representing the middle ground.  I do not know what the outcome of such an investigation would be, but I would be reasonably sure that Article 2 has been breached by both sides.  No one should have anything to be afraid of by taking a look at it.  We should not impose any sort of censorship in this conflict.  There are two sides, although they can be weighted in a particular direction.  In the Gaza Strip it is very much weighted against the Palestinian civilians.  In the greater scheme of things in the Middle East it is very much weighted against Israel.The conflict in Palestine and Israel cannot be compartmentalised.  It is not a stand-alone issue.  It is part of a greater problem.  For the past seven years foreign policy in this area has stagnated.  The five-month ceasefire in 2008 could have been built upon if the political will and vision had existed.  However, an unpopular American policy clouded by an ill-conceived judgment on the terrorist axis of evil impinged on all policy in the Middle East.Israel needs to open up and begin to deal with Syria on the Golan Heights issue.  The actions of Israel in the past week certainly will make it much more difficult for the moderate states of Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority to deal with the more extreme states.  America needs to open dialogue with Iran which not only poses many threats to the western world but also wants to dominate the Arab heartland itself.  At the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I requested that the Iranian ambassador be invited in to ascertain how Iran could assist in developing the peace process.It is wider than just one issue.  However, the Palestinian-Israeli issue is clearly the main one.  It is the spark that ignites the difficulty.  It is the kernel.  There are many other related issues that need to be dealt with.  The destitution of the Palestinian people in Gaza is deplorable, as we have articulated several times in recent months.  I strongly recommend that the members of the joint committee support the Fine Gael amendment.  I do not have any difficulty with the gist of the Fianna Fáil proposal as long as it forms part of a more balanced approach such as that outlined in our amendment.  While the Fianna Fáil motion and the Fine Gael amendment deal specifically with the two trade policies, the Labour Party motion goes further by dealing with the general principle.  I suggest it should be amended radically to reflect a more balanced approach.  We are not on either side here; we are on the side of humanity and legality.  I do not think I can support the Labour Party motion today.  I would be happy to consider an amended Labour Party motion that is more balanced.  I do not have a difficulty with 99% of its contents.

Before I move on my motion, I refer briefly to the Fianna Fáil motion and the Fine Gael amendment that are before the joint committee.  It is good that we are having this debate.  This is the first full debate on the Middle East we have had since I became a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I have no problem with the terms of the good and worthwhile motion moved by Deputies Mulcahy and Dooley.  I have some problems with the Fine Gael amendment, however, which does not seem to address the issue under discussion.  No one is suggesting that the PLO is part of the problem.  The Palestinian representative who attended Tuesday's meeting of the joint committee said he has no time for the Hamas position.  The problem lies with Hamas rather than the PLO.  The PLO is not in the Gaza Strip; Hamas is.

There is no connection between the second part of the motion and what is happening in the Gaza Strip.  The consequences of Hamas's activities have been dealt with by the European Union.  All contact with Hamas has ended since 2004.  There is no trade agreement with Hamas.  What are we talking about in that respect?I am concerned that we are going off on a tangent that will not help us to deal with the issue before us.  Two issues of proportionality must be addressed.  While we want to be as even-handed as we can, we need to reflect on whether the action being taken in response is proportionate.  The question of consequences is a serious one.  The only group to have suffered consequences so far is Hamas.  Israel is benefiting from a preferential trade agreement.  It cannot be suggested that the European Union is treating both protagonists in this conflict equally because that is not the case.  We must recognise the situation.The motion I have tabled seeks to address the actual crisis while proposing a number of ways forward.  Perhaps it would be appropriate for me to outline the contents of the motion for the benefit of the committee.  The first section of the motion deals with the actuality on the ground, as detailed by the major human rights organisations.  The motion then recognises what the Taoiseach has said.  I intend to induce a further clause relating to Hamas before proposing some solutions.  I wish to make it clear that what is happening in Gaza at the moment is an abomination.  Everyone is saying that.  My motion refers to "the continuing occupation of Gaza by the Israeli army, the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians and the flagrant breaches of international law and UN resolutions".  That is the reality of the immediacy of the situation.The motion reminds the committee of the assertion made by Amnesty International rather than by any of the correspondents reporting on this crisis that there is "prima facie evidence of war crimes”.  It points out that the United Nations Human Rights Council, which is the UN’s senior human rights body, has condemned the Israeli offensive for “massive violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people and systematic destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure”.  It refers to “the call by Human Rights Watch for the United Nations Security Council to set up a commission of inquiry into alleged war crimes” and mentions the “bombing of the HQ of the United Nations Relief Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City”, which took place today while the UN General Secretary, Ban Ki-moon, was holding peace talks with the Israeli authorities.  I wish to include an additional clause at this juncture, pointing out that the Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel are “indiscriminate and unacceptable”.In the motion, I welcome "the strong condemnation by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the military incursion into Gaza and the collective punishment of the people of Gaza for the actions of Hamas".  I pay tribute to the position that was adopted by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning.  It is important for the joint committee to recognise in any motion it agrees that they have been strong and forthright on this issue.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I propose that the committee should call "for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of all troops from Gaza and a reopening of the border crossings".  That proposal is based on UN Resolution 1860.  Life in Gaza should return to the semblance of reality that was there before the invasion.

I refer to the proposals in a document that was sent to us some time ago.  It seems the Union is in the process of suspending the upgrading of Israel's status in this respect.  I presume the Minister, Deputy Martin, will attend a meeting of this committee before he travels to the meeting on 26 January.  I would welcome an opportunity to discuss this issue with him before that date.My motion also calls "on the General Affairs and External Relations Council to conduct an immediate review of the existing EU-Israeli Trade Agreement in terms of its required compliance with human rights, democratic principles and international law".  The Council is the relevant body to conduct a review of what has happened already because it will be deciding whether to upgrade Israel's status in this respect.  That ties in with the motion tabled by Deputies Mulcahy and Dooley in so far as the same principle is at stake.  There is a need for an immediate review of the agreement to ensure it complies with human rights, democratic principles and international law.The motion also calls "on the Irish Government to strongly exhort the EU to play a more central and robust role in seeing a resolution to the Middle East crisis based on the rights of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to co-exist in separate States".  There are UN resolutions on that issue.We should remember that the European Union is currently the major player in the Middle East.  It is the major provider of trade to Israel and humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.  Therefore, if the European Union is providing the funding, trade and aid, why should it not be the major broker in the area?  With a new administration due to take over in the United States, it is time that the current initiative and leadership taken by it is put slightly to one side and for the European Union to assert its right to be the major player in this general area given its geographical proximity and all the other connections.  We should examine those matters.  I note that MEPs meeting today in Strasbourg have made a similar proposal, that the European Union would play a more robust part than heretofore in these matters.My final motion calls on the Government to request that the Israeli ambassador would return home immediately to convey to the Israeli Government the serious concerns of the Irish people on these matters of life and death in the Middle East.  I do not propose that we expel him.

I will remove the word "immediately" if the Deputy so wishes, to give the ambassador time to go home at a more leisurely pace, but he should return home to convey the concerns of the Irish people directly to the Israeli leaders.  Let us remember that they are going into talks currently with the United Nations on the way forward.

This issue has dominated the global landscape in political terms for the past three weeks.  Every day there are more deaths.  Already, the death toll, largely of civilians, has reached more than 1,000.  Various indiscriminate attacks have taken place on United Nations schools.  An attack also took place on the UNRWA's headquarters in Palestine.  We have seen the death toll that has occurred.  This is a tragedy and a crisis.  If possible, our response should be based on an agreed approach among ourselves.  If not, we would have to agree to disagree and put the individual motions, which would result in one being voted down.  It would be great if we could get an agreed motion based on all of the proposals that would allow us to move forward with one voice.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion I co-proposed with Deputy Mulcahy.  I intend to support the motion containing the incorporated amendment that was read into the record by him.The action that has taken place in the Gaza Strip in recent weeks is a cynical exercise by Israel in recognition that US foreign policy will change significantly in the coming weeks.  It is my view that Israel has sought to trump up a crisis that did not exist.  There has been talk of rockets being launched from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel.  One only has to look at the death toll to realise there is no justification for the disproportionate action that has been taken.I would hazard a guess that more people have been killed on the short stretches of road in the Gaza Strip that have not been obliterated by the Israeli bombing due to car accidents in recent weeks than have been killed in Israel by rockets from Gaza.  Without getting into the details associated with it, this disproportionate approach is nothing short of a war crime.  It is all about a recognition that there will never be another such opportunity or the same amount of support for Israeli actions, as has been the case heretofore, from the US Administration.  Israel's actions are extremely cynical and Europe has to stand up to it.We talk regularly in the committee about the lack of a coherent foreign policy on behalf of the European Union and the fact that we have had an inability to deal with crises on our own doorstep, as happened in the past, especially in an area of conflict close to the Chairman's heart, Bosnia.  There is an opportunity for Europe to come together in a coherent way to deal with the mechanisms and agreements that are available.  That is why I believe the motion sets a process in place for Ireland as a member state to put forward a coherent process to, first, establish as a matter of fact whether human rights have been breached under the article that has been identified.  That must not be just based on the fact that we read it in the newspaper or that we saw it on television.  A clear determination needs to be made by those people on the ground who have a responsibility in that regard and who are part of the UN apparatus.We should take matters forward from there in line with the manner Deputy Costello suggested, namely, moving it forward into the European context and ensuring that at European level we bring as many of the member states as possible together to devise a policy that will show Israel that it cannot get away with doing this.  Rightly or wrongly, I believe we will see a ceasefire in the coming days in advance of the swearing in of a new president in America.  We cannot allow Israel to move forward in the way it has in the past just because a ceasefire has been called.  There is a requirement on Europe, not to punish, but to be seen to enforce the rule of international law and to do so through existing agreements.Regarding the amendment and the other motion, I welcome the element that has been put forward by Deputy Timmins that has been incorporated by Deputy Mulcahy's amendment.  I disagree with the notion of involving the PLO.  As far as I am concerned the PLO is non-existent in the debate.  I accept there is an issue with Hamas.  We all know that Hamas members are not the kind of angels one wants to bring home to one's mother, or to anyone else.  Clearly, it is an illicit organisation that has perpetrated crimes against its own people and others but we should not try to deflect attention away from the horrendous lack of respect for human dignity and human rights that Israel has shown on this occasion.It would be wrong to try to water down the approach of the European Union.  We are not trying to solve the historical problem that exists through this motion or process.  The current offensive that has been undertaken by the Israeli Government, which I believe is cynical in nature, partly has to do with the fact that an election is due there.  We must deal with the issue to some extent in isolation.  We can do that through the existing apparatus.  It is pointless to talk about an agreement with the PLO because the reality is that the Palestinian people currently have no capacity to trade with anybody, in particular in Gaza, which is sealed off and where people are in a desperate humanitarian situation.  Israel has to be made to understand that it cannot do that and continue to trade openly with blocs such as the European Union and be respected as a player on the international stage.  Israel cannot hide behind what it has done.  I would not be prepared to accept the second part of Deputy Timmins's amendment, and therefore I would stick to the motion.Deputy Costello has set out a very good motion, and I will be supporting it with the exception of one element.  The piece with which I have a problem is the notion of sending the ambassador home.

I think it is important he remains to provide a vehicle for us to inform the Israeli Government of our displeasure about what it is doing, and to attempt to explain to us what justification it has.  Closing the door on Israel is not necessary and may be counterproductive.  The ambassador is a conduit and we should retain that.  Other than that, I would be prepared to support everything else in Deputy Costello's motion.
#DeirdredeBurca	unknown-#DeirdredeBurca-party	unknown-#DeirdredeBurca-dob	unknown-#DeirdredeBurca-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Like others, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the appalling situation that pertains in Gaza at the moment, and to consider the motions put before us.  It is appropriate that this committee is discussing the issue, because we had much debate recently about the Lisbon treaty and very strong arguments were made about the importance of the EU as an international player, its common foreign and security policy, and the importance of promoting its values abroad.  Today, we are looking at a motion proposed by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dooley on the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement between the EU and Israel.  The EU makes it very clear that it uses its neighbourhood policy and its association agreements to promote its values and interests.  We are very aware that article 2 of this association agreement states that relations between the parties, as well as all the provisions of the agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and which constitutes an essential element of this agreement.  The EU is unequivocal on this as it enters into agreements with other states, but that respect for human rights and democratic principles is an essential element of the agreement.Given that there is a slaughter of the civilian population occurring in Gaza at the moment, for whatever reason, one must accept that this involves a breach of international human rights law, which is therefore a breach of Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the EU and Israel.  That is my opinion and I imagine that is shared by other people.  However, the motion being put in front of us today is fair, because it does not prejudge the issue, but calls for the committee to invite in relevant experts to advise the committee on whether Israel is in breach of Article 2 of that association agreement.Others have referred to prima facie evidence of war crimes carried out by the Israelis in Gaza, and Amnesty International certainly believes this.  The UN Human Rights Council has condemned the Israeli offensive for massive violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people, and the systematic destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure.  Human Rights Watch has called for the UN Security Council to set up a commission of inquiry into the alleged war crimes.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have condemned the military incursion and what they have described as the collective punishment of the people of Gaza for the actions of Hamas.This motion is timely, because we quickly need expert advice on the issue of whether Israel is in breach of Article 2.  Certainly, there are serious human rights violations that are ongoing, and these respected bodies are adding their voices to the current discourse.I welcome the Labour Party motion.  I agree with it in most part, but like Deputy Dooley, I cannot support the last part which calls for the Irish Government to request that the Israeli ambassador return home immediately.  We should do that only as a last resort, and perhaps we will arrive at a situation where Ireland feels there is no other option and that the Israelis are continuing to ignore the calls of the international community for proportionate action.  At some stage, we might have to send the Israeli ambassador home.  At this stage, we need to keep diplomatic channels open and to communicate through those channels how strongly the political establishment and the Irish people feel about the humanitarian disaster that is happening in Gaza at the moment.I am disappointed to hear the Fine Gael spokesperson talk about a moderate stance.  It is really difficult to understand how somebody could argue that it is appropriate to take a moderate stance on the kind of potential war crimes and human rights abuses that we are seeing in Gaza.  In the broader sense, I accept Deputy Timmins's point that it is important to recognise rights, interests and wrongs on both sides for any long-term resolution of the situation.  However, this motion relates to the current Israeli offensive in Gaza, the appalling loss of life among the civilian population, the human rights abuses and the apparent violations of the Geneva Convention.  Our committee is dealing with this specific issue, rather than adjudicating on the broader issue of why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for the past 100 years.  The debate today is specific to the offensive that is going on at the moment, and how Ireland can express its strong condemnation of that offensive.  I do not believe that moral equivalence on this issue is acceptable or appropriate.  We would be adopting such a position if we say it is important to be balanced and to be moderate on this specific offensive.I am very happy to support the Fianna Fáil motion today.  I would be happier if there was something in it that gave a particular timeframe.  The committee needs this advice sooner rather than later.  Even if it is not in the wording of the motion, I suggest we look for that advice as quickly as possible, so we can decide whether Ireland will vote to suspend the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I am glad we are here with such an abundance of motions.  I will be supporting the motion supported by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dooley.  In spite of all the advice that we would not be talking about everything, we have ended up doing that.  I am indebted to Deputy Costello for the paragraph which states "considering the bombing of the HQ of the UN Relief Agency in Gaza today, while the UN General Secretary, Ban Ki-moon, is holding peace talks with Israeli leaders".  Has anybody heard of anything quite as cynical and retrograde as that particular event?Deputy Mulcahy's motion is moderate, but I cannot go along with the Fine Gael motion.  It states we must adopt a moderate viewpoint or stance in all of this.  If the events were moderate, would we be here talking about this?  Not at all.  Mass murder is exactly what is going on.  I do not mind who makes funny faces as this is exactly what is going on in Gaza.  People are being mown down — men, women and children.  There is a deliberate targeting, as earlier a UN building was bombed, as well as a school people used for shelter.I know that ultimately diplomacy will have to work but its lazy and leisurely language achieves absolutely nothing.  The UN has made pious ejaculations but what do they mean?  Its representatives have said that what is happening in Gaza is unacceptable but to whom?  It is unacceptable to all of us but we can say that until we are blue in the face.  The bombing will continue.  Using lazy diplomatic language is absolutely at odds with what is happening on the ground.Of course human rights have been breached; it is obvious.  This has nothing to do with Deputy Costello putting the idea down of dispatching somebody home, as it is not needed.  The Israeli ambassador knows quite well what is going on but he is a paid career politician and I presume that is his job.  He is paid to stand up for his side.  I do not know how thin their arguments will get before they are blown apart and seen for what they are.Perhaps I am wrong but I believe there is a properly elected parliament in Palestine.  I know somebody who went out to be a monitor in those elections.  To go on as if these people are some kind of rapparees hiding in the mountains and coming out without any legitimate mandate is wrong.  They have a legitimate mandate.I agree with several points that have been made and I am absolutely satisfied that although Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton were widely pro-Israel in their election campaigns, the innate dignity in searching for the truth that Barack Obama epitomises will lead him to come out very strongly on the issue.  In an election, things come out which might not be always what people feel.  He has stated he will close Guantanamo Bay on his first day — there should be three cheers for that as it surely needs to be closed.  I would be very surprised if on the same day there is not a strong initiative announced on Gaza.This has nothing to do with the debate today but I cannot help but wonder what has happened to Tony Blair, who is the Quartet ambassador in the region.  I see Deputy Costello laughing and he is right.

The issues of human dignity would be green as well but I refer to ecological issues.  He is giving lectures on them.  I read somewhere that he was the Quartet’s ambassador to settle these issues.  He has missed the beat in that dance anyway.I do not know what way the Chairman will end up with all of us.  I would like to support Deputy Costello, if only for bringing to our attention the absolute awfulness of bombing the headquarters of the United Nations relief agency, while at the same time entertaining Mr. Ban Ki-moon as he goes along the path of peace talks.  It is ludicrous.We should not be under any illusion — how can one be moderate when there is mass murder going on of men, women and children?  We have spoken of David and Goliath but this is the strong acting upon the weak.  Throughout folklore and history in any nation in the world, wherever the strong have put themselves upon the weak it is plainly to the detriment of human rights and values.It is correct that we have this discussion.  I am delighted two colleagues have put down a motion today.  I agree with Senator de Búrca in that there should be some immediacy in having these people before the committee and this might be reflected in the motion.  I support Deputy Costello, although I do not agree with sending back this poor gentleman to Jerusalem, or to wherever he wishes to return.  Have they no faxes, telephones or e-mail so he can tell them what is happening?

It should have been there at that time and in fairness to Deputy Mulcahy, at the last European affairs committee meeting, there was an attempt to raise the issue of suspending the Euromed agreement.  Six months ago we would have had the time to call witnesses and to inform ourselves on the matter.We do not now have the time to sit back and wait for people to present themselves to the committee.  Three have been listed and it could be more.  Deputy Dooley has already stated his belief that what is happening is a war crime and Deputy O'Rourke and others have said the same.  If this is the belief, the call from the committee should be for the Government to act on that.  The Government should then demand that the EU act.At the end of the day the EU will go through the process we are talking about of ensuring the t's are crossed and i's are dotted before any agreement is suspended.  At this stage we should go beyond just looking for a suspension of the agreement and seek to abandon the idea of upgrading it.  It is supposed to be paused but that is not good enough.  The actions of the Israeli military and Israeli Government in the past three weeks are an affront to the agreement, and the agreement itself, signed by Ireland as one of the EU members, states in its preamble that it should consider the importance to which the parties attach to the principle of economic freedom and the principles of the United Nations charter, particularly the observance of human rights and democracy, which form the very basis of the association.Israel's action, in bombing the UN building today, is enough for anybody else as a demonstration of its arrogance.  This was a day on which the UN was meeting the Israelis to try to broker a ceasefire.  Ban Ki-moon was there to try to encourage the Israelis at least to declare a ceasefire, and the compound containing the headquarters of a UN agency, a school and other offices was bombed.  The food supplies housed in that building were destroyed, as well as many of the fuel trucks which were used to maintain some sort of normality.  That is quite a list of targets, including the UN school, whose GPS co-ordinates the UN had supplied, ambulance crews, and UN food trucks and their drivers who were killed.  We do not need to investigate this list to a huge degree but it would be enough to suspend any other trade agreement.  Thirteen ambulance drivers are now dead.  I could go through a list.  I do not think we need to wait.It is a pity my colleague, Senator Doherty, could not be present as we had an amendment which aimed to bring greater urgency to the process by calling for the immediate suspension of the agreement.  The amendment then stated that after the suspension we should invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN special rapporteur or even the European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy to appear before the committee so that it could investigate whether the European Union, and Ireland in particular, needed to take other sanctions.Before Christmas there were already sufficient grounds for suspension.  I visited Gaza in November and the evidence I had was of continuous breaches of human rights by the Israelis.  I will not labour the point because much has been said and we could be here all day.  The time for prevarication on this issue is over.  I urge those who put together the amendment to consider this.  We should not just look into the matter but call on the Government to take action.  There should be an acknowledgement of the stance taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which is a lot stronger than in the past.  This is to be welcomed.  The next logical step, based on their comments to date, is suspension of the agreement.If we are considering having hearings on this in the future, one of the people we should ask to attend, whom I met when I was in Gaza, is the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency, John Ging.  He is a brilliant man and he is a straight talker.  Whether he is talking about Hamas, the PLO or the Israelis, he will tell it as it is, as he sees it and as it happened.  We need someone like that to give the background.I am in a minority here so I do not presume members will change their minds on this.  As I said, such a motion would have been welcome six months ago but I do not think it goes far enough this time.  If people are looking at this issue, I encourage them to go to the website of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign and download the document about the Euro-Mediterranean agreements which provides a detailed history.  It is called The European Union's Blind Eye: How the EU ignores Israel's failure to fulfil its obligations under EU agreements, and was put together in October 2008 before any of this happened.  At this stage it is dated because one could list the breaches that have occurred since.  It is a measured document which would be useful for people to read prior to meetings with the people invited under this motion.
#MarkDaly	unknown-#MarkDaly-party	unknown-#MarkDaly-dob	unknown-#MarkDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	114	As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I attended the presentations by the Israeli Ambassador and the Palestinian Authority representative, which did not provide much hope.  I support the motion.  The reason I am not supporting the Fine Gael amendment is that its scope is limited to the current crisis in Gaza, although I hope the reports of the UN rapporteur will explore all breaches of human rights in the West Bank and Gaza by the Israelis over recent years.  The other reason is that I do not want the EU to be policing itself on this issue.  I would have far more faith in a UN report than in an EU report about its own trade agreements because it has not bothered so far to invoke the human rights clause in the trade agreement.This action is similar to the case of South Africa when the world decided to use its muscle with regard to trade and eventually succeeded, although it was a slow process.  It will not bring immediate action by the Israelis but unless the EU stands up for the human rights of the Palestinians, whether in the West Bank or Gaza, no one else will do it.  We cannot rely on others to do it.  This motion is only asking the EU to investigate human rights breaches, which is part of its own trade agreement with the Israelis.  We are not asking it to do anything extraordinary here.  We are just asking for it to do its job, which it is not willing to do.We discussed this at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I hope it will go further.  It is a small step.  Produce is being grown in the occupied West Bank where there are 240,000 illegal settlers.  The UN has passed motion after motion and resolution after resolution about the occupied territories.  During the presidency of Ronald Reagan there were 30,000 illegal settlers and there are now 240,000.  As we are well aware, plantations have long-term consequences.  At some future date I hope Ireland will instigate a ban on the importation of food from the occupied territories.I support the motion.  We must be seen to do this.  It will not have immediate effect but there is very little that would.  The Israelis are not listening to anyone because they have sufficient military might.  No one in the region has the ability or the will to stand up to them.  Trade sanctions worked for South Africa and they will work here if the EU does its job.  The question is whether the EU will do its job.  I have my doubts.  We can only do what we can, and I suggest we do it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The last time I spoke about the Israel-Palestine issue was when I was a Senator.  I have always argued that Ireland should be an honest broker between the two sides and, as far as possible, not take one side or the other.  We should do what we can to contribute to efforts to bring about a peaceful outcome and a two-state solution.  Ireland has a lot to offer in that regard.  We have our own experience here and in Northern Ireland of how two opposing sides can come together.  That is not to say we should not be critical of particular actions by either side.With regard to the motions before us, I agree with the Chairman's suggestion that we should try to come to a consensus.  I would like to see a composite motion on which everyone can agree and a compromise between the differing opinions.  The committee will have taken the wrong approach if we have to have a vote at the end of the meeting.  When I look at the way the issue has been dealt with I assume we support, for example, the way the UN has dealt with it.  It has tried to have an objective view.The other day, South Dublin County Council, my local council, had a minute's silence to mark the deaths and casualties on both sides.  I went to the event organised by Amnesty International last Friday because I felt it was the place for me to register my abhorrence at the deaths of civilians, especially those of children in Gaza.  I noticed there were 800 people on the march that was organised last Saturday.  By comparison, there was a peace rally in Belfast which had about 5,000 people as far as I could judge.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	117	It may have been 800 or 1,000.  The point is there should have been something here that was more about peace.  I could not attend the march on Saturday because it seemed to me it was taking a position against Israel that I did not feel I could support.My issue with the motion proposed by Deputy Mulcahy relates to a section of the wording.  I have a difficulty with the phrase "on the Palestinian territories".  I am sure we can agree on something that would amend the Deputy's motion slightly.  Despite what Deputy Mulcahy said, because of the way the motion is worded, we are getting more than a little into the rights and wrongs of the situation.  That is borne out by the speeches given by Deputies Mulcahy, Dooley, O'Rourke and others.  I do not believe we should do that.The Deputy said he would not presume the outcome of the investigation.  My understanding is that he said something along those lines.  He said he was trying to be objective and that he would let the investigation take its course.  However, I do not believe the present wording allows for that.  A slight change to it would make it more neutral.  I say this because that investigation must also take into account the human rights of the Israelis.  We might have a wording that mentions, for example, "the human rights of those in the Palestinian territories and in Israel", or it could state "on the situation of the human rights of the Palestinians and Israelis".  The human rights of Israelis are part of the picture.In saying that, I am absolutely opposed to the current Israeli actions.  They are disproportionate.  I am appalled at the acts that have led to the deaths and casualties of people in both the Palestinian territories and in Israel, particularly those deaths in Gaza and the children who have been killed over recent weeks.  At the same time, I support Israel as a state.  I am sympathetic to its plight as a state and to its need for security.On the general issue, Deputy Mulcahy made a point about the EU club, as it were, and the positions certain countries such as the UK were taking on the European Union.  I would bring to his attention an article by the UK Foreign Secretary, David Milliband, published in The Guardian today.  Mr. Milliband argues that the use of the war on terror as a western rallying cry since the attacks of 11 September 2001 has been a mistake that may have caused more harm than good.  I agree with him.  His article is significant because it shows a shift in the British stance with regard to the policy of the United States over recent years.  Deputy Timmins also made this point.  David Milliband’s speech is more critical of the US actions in Iraq than the Government or Fianna Fáil have ever been.  The international community is culpable in all this.  We must look at where we can move forward from here.  We all know the situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories is tied up with the entire Middle East question and with the policy pursued there by the United States and the United Kingdom.We have allowed this issue to come off the agenda.  It used to arise a lot when I was in the Seanad but lately it has not surfaced very often.  That is the reality.  Despite what people have said about human rights being diminished in Gaza over recent years and because of the blockade, we have not discussed the matter much, as far as I know.  It is very important that we do not allow it go from the agenda when the ceasefire to this particular conflict eventually happens, as we hope it does.  In this regard we should act as an honest broker.  Our primary aim should be to ensure there are diplomatic efforts to bring about a peaceful solution.It is very important that we keep up diplomatic relations with both sides.  I agree with points that have been made in this regard.  It is very important we get across to the Israeli ambassador and to Israeli ministers how we feel about the current Israeli actions, that we let them know we find their current actions to be disproportionate and that we are appalled that their acts have led to the deaths of civilians, especially children.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I wish to make a few comments before the end of the discussion.  We can do one of two things.  We can vote on the respective motions or we can produce a composite motion.  There is a trend common through all the debate and common to all speakers with degrees of difference and emphasis.I am not an expert in this area but I was in that region 25 to 30 years ago.  I visited the Golan Heights shortly after the war that took place there and I stayed in Israel.  A couple of points must now be borne in mind.  First, there are, and have been, violations on both sides .  The Israeli ambassador and the head of mission of the general delegation of Palestine to Ireland appeared before this committee six months ago because of views expressed by committee members who recognised there was a need to do something about the ongoing running sore that exists in that area.  A discussion took place, and rightly so.To be fair to the ambassador and to the head of mission, they both presented themselves as reasonable people who fully understood their respective situations and the situation of their counterpart.  I have no doubt about that.  However, when that immediacy is removed and a wider community brought in, different people give different versions of what is seen to be right or wrong.  These do not always reflect reality.The ambassador and the head of mission will strive to use their influence to achieve the objectives of virtually every speaker here.  That must be borne in mind.  We must recognise also that Hamas is elected but that it does not recognise the state of Israel.  It has refused repeatedly to recognise it, as have other states in the region which have indicated that the annihilation of the state of Israel and its population is an objective.  That is not acceptable.  That point was made by the previous speaker and by several others.  All members have recognised that.  There is a need for us to recognise that in those circumstances all is not as it may seem at a particular time. The most recent event may not be fundamental to all the issues.The question of proportionality has arisen repeatedly.  I do not accept the rationale behind that viewpoint.  If one accepts proportionality when a shell is fired on one side, another must be fired by the other side.  If there is one death on one side, there must be another on the other side and if there is an atrocity on one side, there must be an equally atrocious act on the other side.In this country, over the last 35 years we have had first-hand experience of that kind of tit for tat arrangement and it does not work.  As a nation we have had considerable experience in this area and we must consider if there is something else that could or should be done at this time, rather than exacerbate the problem.When we discussed this issue before, the issue of the wall, segregation and huge inconvenience and hardship suffered by Palestinians as a result of that division were considered.  The wall is in place because suicide bombers were coming in and blowing up innocent people on a regular basis.  That is the history of the situation.  I do not think that is acceptable.  We must recognise we are not in favour of that situation, nor should we be.  We should not be in favour of excesses of reaction on either side.Reference was made to the killing of innocent children in schools, hospitals and so forth.  How often have we heard of situations in this country over the past 35 years where people were killed by mistake?  They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and were not meant to be killed but that is of little consolation to the victims.  We must recognise that ourselves.The call for the ambassador to return home is counterproductive.  I will come to the rest of the motion.  The poor unfortunate man understands——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	124	----what the situation is, as does his counterpart, who is the head of mission.  They fully appreciate the magnitude of the problem and what must be done.  After their 50 or 60 years of history it must be asked if they have the strength, width and depth to be able to deal with a situation which includes history, tradition, religion, prejudice, hatred and politics.  Can they confront those situations and recognise what exists?Did we have the strength, width and depth in this country to deal with it?  We did, after 50, 60 or 70 years.  We have learned lessons and I have no doubt we can be influential, as several speakers stated when we met previously.There have been war crimes on both sides.  When I was younger I avidly read about the war between Israel and Palestine and still have a friend, who is much older than I am, who fought in that war on the British side.  Within this debate we need to encompass the likely influence, if any, we may have on the future.  It must be positive and based on recognition of the full, long, unfortunate history of the region and not on one event or triggered by one event.  Occasionally, as in our own history, we have had a situation where a single event brings everything to the fore.  Suddenly there is reaction, counteraction, killing and counter-killing.Speaking anecdotally, the only standing ovation I received in my public life was in an address to the Euromed conference about ten or 15 years ago.  It was the only time anyone recognised my existence.  It was in the European Parliament.I strongly urge agreement on a common motion.  I see nothing wrong with it and it would carry at least as much weight, but there needs to be recognition by both sides that a one-sided approach relates only to the current situation.There were atrocities in the past.  I remember a family wedding in Jerusalem about four or five years ago where the entire wedding party was blown up by a suicide bomber.  That is not acceptable.  There cannot be reaction after reaction and counter-killing after counter-killing.  The issue now requires the coming together of various agencies under the influence of the EU and UN to bring the sides together and see what can be done in a positive way, or at least reduce the degree to which the bitterness led to the current situation.

People are entitled to their opinion but are not entitled to misrepresent others.  One cannot be moderate in condemnation.  Fine Gael condemns the gross acts which have been carried out in Gaza.  I do not proclaim to have the monopoly on moral indignation, unlike others.  I do not agree with selective condemnation; it should be across the board.I believe that an EU peacekeeping force should be deployed to the area and Ireland should be part of it.  If a UN resolution cannot be obtained, which is likely,  we should still seek to send such a force.  I have listened to many other people talking.  Do any others on the committee support such a position, with the exception of the Chairman?  There will not do so because their parties do not support it.I feel so strongly about this issue that I believe the EU should send a peacekeeping force to Gaza, Ireland should be part of it and if there is disagreement at UN level it should be sent in any event.  We should not be bound by the UN because it is an organisation that does not operate properly due to its veto system.

It is important to realise that.  Egypt has a crossing into Gaza.  I am not here to fight the argument again.I tabled the amendment because I believe the only way to solve this problem is by adopting the middle ground.  I will not elaborate any more.  I am happy to vote in favour of the Fianna Fáil motion, provided part (b) of our motion is added regarding Article 2.  I tabled it because it is important to highlight the vacuum within which Gaza currently operates, and it is the only way we can address the problem.I move the amendment to the motion.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	134	We have moved it already and I will put the question in a moment.Everybody had flaws in their arguments and I have referred to them.  I recognise the ninth special session of the Human Rights Council on the grave violation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, which was quoted by Deputy Mulcahy.  There was a recorded vote of 33 in favour, one against and 13 abstentions.  I would not regard some of the 33 countries who voted in favour as being hotbeds of human rights and democracy, such as China, Gibuti, Ghana, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Qatar and the Russian Federation.There are also a number of countries which abstained which would themselves have some problems.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The subject matter of the motion and debate can be used as a contribution to a debate in the Houses when they return and in a debate which may take place between this committee and the ambassador of Israel and the head of mission from Palestine next Tuesday when we meet again.I do not propose to go through the whole debate again.  Next Tuesday the witnesses will respond to the debate, the proceedings of which they will have read.  I thank members for being temperate in their discussion.  It is important that all sides of an argument of this sensitive nature be observed and that we are seen to be doing anything we can do to assist in the matter.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Yes, we had invited the ambassador of Israel and the head of mission to attend today but they could not come for various reasons.  The invitation stands for next Tuesday because this issue will not be resolved overnight.  It is presumed that the members will want to have some interaction with the witnesses.

The motion refers specifically to two members of the UN, or their representatives, and the European Commissioner for External Relations and now states "and any other persons which this Committee deems necessary".  It is important if we are conducting hearings on this matter that people are asked to come specifically with this motion in mind and not otherwise, unless they are being invited for a general discussion.  The witnesses should be clear about the purpose of their attendance.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	150	For the benefit of the committee it might be no harm to clarify who is intended by "any other persons". How long is this piece of string?  We should know beforehand.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	151	It is a matter for the committee.  I read out a list including the people mentioned in the motion.  I suggested Mr. Dick Spring and or the Taoiseach who were there at the time, a lawyer for legal interpretation of the agreement.  I suggested people from both sides of the conflict.  I do not have a closed mind as to whom we should invite.  We should invite anybody who wants to give testimony.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	152	In the first instance, the committee will agree who arrives and when.  I do not have a problem with that.  At next Tuesday's meeting we should have the head of mission and the ambassador as was already intended.I have just been told the ambassador cannot attend next Tuesday.  We will consult the Whips of the various groups beforehand as to who is available and get agreement on that.Is that agreed?  Agreed.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I move:That this Committee,Considering the continuing occupation of Gaza by the Israeli army, the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians and the flagrant breaches of international law and UN resolutions;Considering the assertion by Amnesty International that there is "prima facie evidence of war crimes";Considering that the United Nation's senior human rights body the U.N. Human Rights Council, has condemned the Israeli offensive for "massive violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people and systematic destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure";Considering the call by Human Rights Watch for the United Nations Security Council to set up a commission of inquiry into alleged war crimes;Considering the bombing of the H.Q. of the United Nations Relief Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City today 15th January 2009 while UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon is holding peace talks with Israeli leaders;Considering the indiscriminate and unacceptable rocket attacks by Hamas on Southern Israel;Welcoming the strong condemnation by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the military incursion into Gaza and the collective punishment of the people of Gaza for the actions of Hamas;Calls for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of all troops from Gaza and a reopening of the border crossings;Calls on the Irish Government at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on the 26th January to ensure E.U. suspension of the proposed upgrading of Israel's status under the European Neighbourhood Policy;Calls on the General Affairs and External Relations Council to conduct an immediate review of the existing E.U./ Israeli Trade Agreement in terms of its required compliance with human rights, democratic principles and international law;Calls on the Irish Government to strongly exhort the E.U. to play a more central and robust role in seeing a resolution to the Middle East crisis based on the rights of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to co-exist in separate States; andCalls on the Irish Government to request that the Israeli Ambassador return home immediately, to inform the Israeli Government of these matters of life and death which are of such serious concern to the Irish people.I will not make a speech but it is important that we move a motion in this committee that reflects to a degree what is happening in Gaza, and the experience of the major international organisations that have a human rights responsibility in that area and are on the ground there.  That is the point of the first part of my motion.We should also condemn those responsible and propose a way forward.  The motion we have agreed to refers to one area that has been a bone of contention and on which we have long sought clarification.  My motion considers a couple of other issues in approximately the same area, the relationship with the Israeli Government in the context of the work of this committee through the General Affairs and External Relations Council which holds monthly meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  That council has a significant role in Middle East policy.I also propose that the European Union be more centrally involved in brokering a deal than it has been in the past.  Despite having Tony Blair there as its envoy the Union seems to have been sidelined.  It is important to emphasise this.The final point is the controversial one, that the ambassador of Israel would convey these points to the homeland and having done so return here and report to us.  I do not wish to suggest that this is one-way traffic or that the ambassador be expelled.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	158	Would the Deputy consider deleting from the words "return home immediately to" so that it reads "to request that the Israeli Ambassador inform the Israeli Government of these matters of life and death which are of such serious concern to the Irish people" ?  It should be left to the ambassador to decide how to communicate that message, whether by e-mail or fax or by flying home.

I hope, notwithstanding that objection, that the members of the Government parties in this committee will use their influence with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure that much of the sentiment in the motion is adopted as Government policy.  I am not in a position to agree with this motion because I do not think it will help the problem but would give rise to more division.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I am prepared to include an additional phrase in my motion if that would help Deputy Timmins.  We are bending over backwards to assist him in this matter.  After the reference to "Considering the bombing of the HQ of the United Nations Relief Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City today 15th January 2009 while UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon is holding peace talks with Israeli leaders", I am prepared to include a reference to "Considering the indiscriminate and unacceptable rocket attacks by Hamas on Southern Israel".

I would not be in a position to accept the motion as a whole, however, as I feel it would be too divisive.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-15 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I suggest that the committee should postpone its final two items — statutory instruments received and any other business — until its meeting next Tuesday.  They are not so urgent that they cannot wait until next week.  I thank members for their indulgence.  I hope today's debate has been of some assistance in the context of the overall situation.
