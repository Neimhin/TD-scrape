        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Mr. Ciarán Breen<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for giving me the opportunity to set out the State Claims Agency's approach to managing claims against the 146 State bodies that fall within the remit given to it by the Oireachtas. I am joined by my colleague, Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and we will be happy to answers members' questions shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> It is important that I set out the details of the agency's role in the Vicky Phelan case. This is clearly a tragic case that has had dreadful consequences for Ms Phelan and her family. I assure the committee that at every stage of our involvement in this case, we have been acutely aware of the consequences, trauma and pain Ms Phelan and her family have suffered and continue to suffer. In carrying out our statutory role in managing this case, we have been mindful of the need to ensure that, wherever possible, nothing that we did would add to the suffering of Ms Phelan and her family.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> In managing personal injury litigation taken by persons against the State, we never forget that our work frequently involves the management of difficult, complex and traumatic cases taken by persons who have suffered injury, sometimes of a catastrophic nature. We have a duty, when managing personal injury claims, to manage any individual claim in a humane, ethical, professional and sensitive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Our role in Ms Phelan's case arose because one of the parties she took a case against was the Health Service Executive, HSE, which is one of our clients. The HSE was not the only party. Ms Phelan's case was also against the United States laboratory that had carried out her smear test. It was called Clinical Pathology Laboratories. In every case with multiple parties, each party conducts its own defence independently of the other parties. We managed the case on behalf of the HSE but the US laboratory had separate legal representation and a separate legal strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The primary legal issue in this case centred on the alleged misreading of Ms Phelan's original smear test. The US laboratory accepted that legal liability for that issue rested with it alone and that the HSE was not legally responsible for the misreading. As part of the US laboratory's defence of this issue, its lawyers sought a confidentiality clause that would have restricted Ms Phelan from disclosing details of the settlement or the case. The State Claims Agency opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan's case and no such request was made by our agency. The request by the US laboratory was not supported by the agency. Our view is that the US laboratory's insistence on a confidentiality clause was a significant factor in the failure to resolve the claim through mediation. Mediation is our preferred route for resolving cases of this nature as it would have eliminated the need for court hearings or a contested court action. A settlement, consequent upon mediation, would have made it unnecessary for Ms Phelan to go to court, personally give evidence and experience all the stress and anxiety that a court hearing entails.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> A total of 98% of all cases managed by our agency are resolved without the need for a contested court hearing. It was not possible to resolve this case through mediation, but that was for reasons outside our control, and I have referred to those reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> I would like to make a number of points about the way we manage cases. I am conscious that the committee asked us here today specifically to discuss this issue. In Ms Phelan's case, it has not been reported by the media generally that the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Cross, praised the manner in which the case was managed by the State Claims Agency and the other parties. While some cases can take up to between two to three years to be concluded, Ms Phelan's case was settled within ten weeks of the summons being lodged. The judge said the case was handled in an efficient and humane manner, with all sides pulling out the stops to get the matter ready for hearing quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> We have heard commentary from some observers in recent days suggesting that the State was in some way trying to place obstacles in the way of settling this case. The judge's comments, being those of an independent party, demonstrate that the opposite was the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I will now update the committee on the current number of cases we are managing which are similar to Ms Phelan's case. In addition to Ms Phelan's now concluded case, we are managing nine other similar cases, and we are aware of one additional case where a formal claim has not yet been made. We have received an indemnity from the independent laboratories in three of the nine cases to date and we have sought indemnities in all others. We will manage all of these cases in the same way we managed Ms Phelan's case, namely, carrying out our statutory role by placing a high priority on treating the people who have made the claims, and their families, with the dignity and compassion they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">We have no intention of mounting a full defence in any case of this nature where responsibility is substantially or completely that of the State. In any such case, we will pursue other options, including mediation or settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> We have a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the taxpayer. We also have a duty, however, towards injured persons who have suffered a medical negligence related injury, including following a misdiagnosis, and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies. We never lose sight of the fact that in many cases the injured parties, together with the families, have suffered significant trauma and pain. Recognising this, the agency aims always to act fairly, ethically and with compassion in its dealings with these people and their families as well as in the management of all cases which fall within our remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> In cases of medical negligence, our policy is to admit liability as soon as the expert medical evidence becomes available to indicate there has been a breach of duty. The agency takes every step it can to ensure that litigation is handled sensitively to ensure no additional distress is caused to the person who has made the claim or to his or her family. The agency is required, however, to operate in accordance with its statutory mandate to investigate claims thoroughly and to manage litigation in a professional manner. I am not suggesting to the committee that it is an easy task to get this balance right when carrying out our statutory role, knowing the often devastating personal consequences for persons who have suffered injury, nor would I suggest that we always get this balance right to the satisfaction of all the parties in the case. However, we make every effort to do so. I hope the facts, such as those put on the court record by Mr. Justice Kevin Cross in Ms Phelan's case and by the same judge in two other cases last week bear this out.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Senator Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I welcome Mr. Breen and Ms Foley to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Vicky Phelan is a neighbour of mine. I know the type of person she is and what she has gone through. The briefing note given to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on 16 April states the State Claims Agency had advised it believed the issue of non-disclosure would fall or be dismissed and, therefore, there was no exposure for the State. Why did the agency give that advice?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Ciarán Breen<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">We did not state that we felt it would fail. We acknowledged in our defence that there had been a breach of duty by the HSE's cervical screening and the HSE via the consultant in not telling Ms Phelan. The only point that we put into that note for the Minister was an issue of exemplary damages which might accrue to the State in respect of that. We indicated that in the absence of malice, the claim would not be made out. One of the reasons we said that was because, when it was put to Ms Phelan's expert whether he thought there was malice on the part of the State in the delay in notifying Ms Phelan, he said there was not. It was just a legal point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Senator Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">With due respect, this is about life or death. When it became known that there was an incorrect reading of a smear test in 2014 and which was not given to Ms Phelan until 2017, three years later, surely at best it was gross incompetence. Mr. Breen is speaking about the whole issue of intent. Surely, as the officer charged with legally advising the HSE, Mr. Breen should have said on the issue of non-disclosure - that is the key issue here - a wrong was done. At that stage Mr. Breen should have been advising the State to accept liability. Furthermore, he should have ensured the State Claims Agency and the laboratory in America, CPL, Clinical Pathology Laboratories Inc., accepted liability, offered a settlement to Vicky Phelan and not have dragged her through court for four days. Instead, she was dragged through the court and had to put her condition in the public domain. It was offensive to the public and grossly unfair to Vicky Phelan and her family. As the chief legal officer advising the State, Mr. Breen should have said on non-disclosure that we accepted legal liability. It should not have happened. Instead, it resulted in Vicky Phelan being told at the end of 2017 of the difficulty she has with her health. This would not have arisen if she had been told of the incorrect smear in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> When I read this opening statement, the State Claims Agency still does not appear to be admitting that the issue of non-disclosure was culpability on the part of the HSE. Vicky Phelan is an incredible woman. She came out when she was not well and stood up for women and the truth. We still have the situation, however, whereby Mr. Breen is advising the State, the HSE and the Minister for Health, that the issue of non-disclosure was something for which the State should not accept liability. If the State had accepted liability for it, Vicky Phelan would not have ended up having to go to court. Is that not correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_7">
          <from> Mr. Ciarán Breen<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">No. I will take the Senator through the sequence of what happened. I deplore the fact that Vicky Phelan was not told. The Senator is absolutely right that she should have been told.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Senator Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">Mr. Breen, that is great. However, actions speak louder than words. Mr. Breen could have advised the State to accept liability. Both the State Claims Agency and CPL could have come together. However, no offer was made to Vicky Phelan prior to the court case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_9">
          <from> Mr. Ciarán Breen<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_34">If I could take the Senator through the sequence, he might find where my logic is coming from on this. What happened was we did acknowledge and admit liability in respect of the non-disclosure. That was in our defence. As a matter of record and as a matter of law, we admitted liability. That was wrong and we said so.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The issue in the case was whether that failure to disclose affected Vicky Phelan's clinical outcome. There was a separate issue in the case whereby the US laboratory, during the short period before the case went to trial, had admitted liability, had offered the State an indemnity and would deal with her settlement. What happened in the particular case was the solicitors firm acting on behalf of the US laboratory had some difficulty getting instructions from its insurance company. We were, at all times, pushing towards making sure that Vicky Phelan got a settlement. That is always what we wanted to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">That is the key point I want to make. This needs to come out. When Vicky Phelan brought this court case, there were two defendants, CPL and the HSE. The State Claims Agency was advising the HSE. As the senior officer, Mr. Breen was responsible for this advice. If disclosure had been made back in 2014, Vicky Phelan would be in a different position today. That is the key point here. The smear test reading was a major error. It was realised in 2014 that there was an incorrect reading in 2011. If she had been told at that time, medical action could have been taken and Vicky Phelan would be in a different position today.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">If the State Claims Agency had accepted non-disclosure early on and it had discussed the case with CPL it could have made an offer to Vicky Phelan, on the basis of the acceptance of non-disclosure, and she would not have had to be dragged publicly through the courts for four days, having had to reveal parts of her life that no one should be asked to reveal.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I would return to the point, and I must make it to the Senator again, that our expert evidence and Vicky Phelan's expert evidence was that the non-disclosure point, albeit a terrible point and I deplore the fact that she was not told, did not change her clinical outcome. That was agreed by her expert and by our expert. I deplore the fact that she was not told. We, as an agency, do not have any control over that. We have for a very long time told all of our agencies and hospitals that they should practice full open disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> If I could return to the issue of why her case went to trial, the only reason it went to trial was because the solicitors for the US laboratory could not get sufficient instructions at a point in time, and then they did and they made the offer in the case. The Senator might recall that this case, which we supported being settled via mediation, which would have prevented Vicky Phelan from giving any evidence, collapsed because of the confidentiality clause provision which was insisted upon by the US laboratory. We went on record at that time to say that this is wrong, this should not be done, and that there should not be a confidentiality clause. We did everything we possibly could to try to get the case settled, but we had a letter of indemnity, a complete indemnity, for everything from the US laboratory.</p>

The Taoiseach, through the Attorney General, has gone directly to Mr. Breen to ask that it would look at dealing with these cases on a more compassionate basis than what happened with Vicky Phelan. Has the agency taken that on board? Of those ten cases, are any of the women deceased? If Mr. Breen had Vicky Phelan's case to deal with again, would he deal with it differently?</p>

The one thing that we cannot allow ever to happen in the exercise of our statutory remit is to allow off the hook a party who should be substantially or wholly liable if they should be paying the damages to the injured party.

          <p eId="para_65">In practice what happens is that a letter of claim will come in on behalf of the injured woman and that letter will be sent to cervical screening. Cervical screening immediately issues a letter to the relevant laboratory, whether it is one or other of the laboratories, stating: "This letter has arrived and under the contract that you have with us, you are obliged, in the event that this is a misread smear, to provide an indemnity". In some of the cases, the US laboratory has immediately indemnified the HSE on the basis that it is the laboratory's mistake. If that happens and the laboratory takes over the indemnity, then the matter is live only between the injured woman and the laboratory and the lawyers on both sides. The HSE is not involved. If the laboratory, for whatever reason, does not give an indemnity, we will be a co-defendant in the case and we will be looking at why it is that the relevant indemnity has not been given to the State, or whether it should be given to the State or what other issues there are in the case.</p>

This is separate to the non-disclosure agreements with women whose smear tests returned false negatives. Where a sum is agreed and the State Claims Agency is the representative of the State, will Mr. Breen give us a sense of or data on how common it is for the State to insist on confidentiality clauses governing settlements and payouts, particularly in cases of medical negligence and other clinical cases?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">They rarely arise because they run counter to all open disclosure provisions that we espouse and advocate, but there are occasions when they arise. I will take the committee through them.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> First is mediation, a process to which both parties must agree. Independent of the State Claims Agency and the plaintiff, an intrinsic part of the process is that all that happens at the mediation is confidential so that when the parties of the mediation fail and they must go to court, they will not use anything that happened at the mediation. It is not imposed by us. Rather, it is imposed on us and the other party by the mediator. However, if a settlement is reached at mediation in cases that we are involved in, we never insist on confidentiality regarding the settlement amount or anything like that.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">Never. Where that information has been disclosed, we have never taken any action within the confidentiality provisions. Confidentiality might arise in other circumstances. In some instances where we had a line of similar cases in a class action-type scenario, we were admitting or settling a particular case amidst that group for reasons other than the substantial reasons that gave rise to the cases and we wanted to delineate that case, we might sometimes have requested a confidentiality clause about the settlement. In the overall scheme of the approximately 8,500 cases that we have settled since inception, though, it has rarely occurred, but it has occurred. Sometimes, plaintiffs ask us for a confidentiality clause. Where they do, we always offer it.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I will start where Mr. Breen left off with confidentiality agreements. There are many shameful aspects to this case but one of the most shameful is the fact that Vicky Phelan was asked to gag herself. We must be thankful for her courage in refusing and continuing to fight in difficult circumstances. It is why we now know about this national scandal. Mr. Breen outlined that the State Claims Agency opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan's case and that no such request had been made by the agency. Can Mr. Breen explain what the agency did to oppose the request for a confidentiality clause by the US lab?</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I can because of the fact that mediation did not take place. As the mediation was being set up, the mediator spoke to the parties independently. He indicated that the US laboratory was seeking such a confidentiality clause. In such situations, mediators ask the other defendant for its view on such a proposal. When we replied, we were in no doubt that we did not believe such a clause was right or proper. We indicated separately to our co-defendant that we did not believe that asking Vicky Phelan to abide by such a clause was the right thing to do. I want to be clear about that - we opposed it all the way.</p>

As has been the case with many defendants over the years, up to when we started to espouse open disclosure as the proper thing to do, there were probably occasions where confidentiality clauses were put into settlements. Without going back over individual cases, I am guessing that, of the 8,500 clinical cases we have resolved, no more than a dozen and a half or perhaps two dozen were in that category over all those years.</p>

Normally, when we seek such a clause, it is to protect something that we are not admitting in similar cases. We would not want the view to be going out that we had admitted liability in other similar cases that might be coming along, if we had a strong view on liability.</p>

However, the State is not just concerned with pounds, shillings and pence; it should also be concerned with what kind of society we have. It is obvious in this case, and the State Claims Agency agrees, that if there had been a confidentiality agreement, it would have been to the detriment of the State, or society as a whole or the public. In similar cases, it is in the interest of the public and State to know where something has gone wrong, or is at least perceived to have gone wrong, and the State Claims Agency either admits liability or offers some sort of redress or payment.</p>

My worry was - my advices were entirely guided by this - that I did not want it to become a box-ticking exercise by people making disclosures. I believed that a voluntary system would have much greater buy-in and that people would proceed in an atmosphere in which they did not simply feel compelled to disclose.

After that, the lawyers send out a letter of claim and a summons. It is at that point we enter the process to examine the claim. We receive the claim and we begin to examine it.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">Yes. Normally what happens is either the plaintiff or we - or, in this case, the US laboratory - suggests the better way of handling it would be by mediation.

However, if a woman gets a result back from the HSE CervicalCheck stating that she is fine and she is not fine, I believe most people would feel that they were hard done by in terms of being told something that was not the case. Even if the clinical outcome in the end was not different, perhaps it could have managed everything differently.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">Not at that time. There were other cases, as we now know. There were 11 cases; ten plus one potential case. However, Ms Phelan's case was very advanced and was very much based on its particular facts, including the issue of non-disclosure which was set out in her pleadings. We did not know until a very late point in that case that there were women who were similarly affected. In fact, we found that out through the media.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">No. We issue a list of sensitive cases to Government, which I believe is in the public domain, via the Minister for Finance. It is presented along with the sensitive case list of the Attorney General. It was agreed in 2007 that that list would not include medical negligence cases because almost all medical negligence cases are sensitive, involving particular trauma. We had to consider how many such cases should appear on such a sensitive list. Sometimes we do not know when a case involves the kind of sensitivity that Ms Phelan's case had. It is not always immediately apparent to us.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_282">There are ten on this list that I can see in front of me, but I cannot share it with the committee because it is a State Claims Agency list. Ten cases are listed as active which means, in essence, that they are either in legal proceedings or they are in pre-legal proceedings and there is a further one which is described as "potential".</p>

          <p eId="para_322">We have to look at every case because the particulars of negligence will differ from case-to-case. Our statement said, and we want to be very clear about it, that if the State has any liability in these cases we will clearly be dealing with them in a particular way, which is to ensure that injured parties do not go through the kind of trauma that Vicky Phelan had to go through in terms of, for example, a court trial. That is where we can establish that the State has a liability. If, on the other hand, the liability is that of the laboratory, quite clearly it will be indemnifying us and we will be out of the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">Is that not akin to saying to these women that it is not the fault of the HSE but the fault of the laboratory and that they should pursue the laboratory? By operating as Pontius Pilate the agency is ensuring that there will be legal cases because the laboratory in America will pursue this. Is it not the case that these women were let down by the State? They were completely and utterly failed by the State because of misdiagnosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The State Claims Agency should be settling with every one of them. Then the agency should sue the laboratory in America. Instead, the agency is asking people who now have a cancer diagnosis to pursue the State. The same applies in certain circumstances involving people who lost loved ones - they are grieving families. The State Claims Agency is washing its hands and suggesting people sort it out with the laboratory in America. Why can the agency not settle with these individuals? Why can the agency not do what the Taoiseach has said? Even if there is no legal responsibility, there is a moral responsibility. The agency should settle with these women. Then, if the laboratory in America failed in its duties - clearly it has - then the agency should sue the laboratory and get the money back. Why make the individual victims go through this arrangement?</p>

          <p eId="para_329">We are constrained by our statutory remit. We can only do things in a particular way. We must ensure the State does not pay out when another party should pay out. That is the constraint we operate under and we cannot do anything different from that. If the State decides to have a form of redress for the women involved, that is a different matter. That would involve taking the matter entirely out of our hands and into a redress scheme. We are constrained by what we can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> I understand the point Deputy Doherty is making well. I agree with him that it is terribly tragic that women have to take these cases against the laboratories involved, but the laboratory is the liable party based on-----</p>

          <p eId="para_331">The women did not go to the laboratory in America. They went for a service operated under the HSE and the HSE has failed them. The HSE should settle this. The State Claims Agency should do it. If the laboratory with which the HSE has a contract has failed the executive, then the executive should sue.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> Another question comes from evidence or testimony provided by Mr. John Gleeson, the programme manager of CervicalCheck. He talked about the Vicky Phelan case.

          <p eId="para_333">No. Sorry, from our point of view, we came into the case when the personal injury summons had been served.

          <p eId="para_336">Let me go on a little bit further. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_337">The legal team said it had an issue around the delay in informing the affected woman. That element of the case was struck out; it was not that we did not tell the patient, it was noted that the information was late and took a long time. That was the basis. After that, any engagement largely centred on legal teams and we were asked if a settlement was proposed during mediation prior to a court appearance. The State Claims Agency advised that we should be supportive of any such moves. We took the agency's advice and said "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Was there consideration whereby the State should settle with Vicky Phelan in mediation? Did that conversation between the State Claims Agency and CervicalCheck take place as represented by Mr. John Gleeson?</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I do not know the exact context for why he says it that way. I am simply reading into what Deputy Doherty has put before me. I would say that was a discussion with the State Claims Agency. When the agency was talking to its co-defendant obviously we would have been supporting the idea that there should be a settlement with Vicky Phelan by the US laboratory.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">The State did contribute to the settlement. It contributed a sum of €25,000. I will explain the only reason we made the contribution. The circumstances were that the US laboratory delayed and was prepared to go into another day's hearing with Vicky Phelan. To prevent that we put up a figure of €25,000 as a contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">Mr. Breen is arguing that the reason he will defend these cases is that he believes the non-disclosure did not lead to adverse clinical outcomes. We are aware that earlier this year Vicky Phelan was fundraising for treatment. We are aware that if some of the women who are now unfortunately deceased had been aware in 2014 that there was a misdiagnosis and had been informed at the time that they had options for treatment, then the outcomes could have been different. They could have taken part in clinical experiments and so on. Does Mr. Breen not think that has value in itself? If these women knew this information earlier, it would not have changed their diagnosis of cervical cancer but it would have allowed them to look at other types of treatment, drugs or clinical trials. Those options were delayed. In three cases in which proceedings against the State are under way the options were not only delayed but those involved never had the opportunity to take them up in the first place. How can Mr. Breen say that there is no liability on the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_345">I have to operate within the law of tort. Statutorily, that is what I am told to do: I must operate within that system. If the system said that material non-disclosure affected the clinical outcome, then we would definitely have got involved and would have compensated for it. That is absolutely definite.</p>

          <p eId="para_387"> In most of the commentary today there is talk about the 98% of clinical negligence cases that are settled without the necessity for a contested court hearing. That is not all of the work the agency covers, as there are other cases outside of that involving all the various agencies that are represented. I was struck by the figure of 98% because I am aware of a number of cases that went to court outside of the HSE, and cases that were then settled where a gagging order was put in place. I have come across that a lot in the context of my term on the Committee of Public Accounts. The reference to 98% of cases would lead one to believe that there is nothing to worry about given that 98% of the cases are dealt with, but if I were to examine some of the cases, without naming them, that have come before the State Claims Agency, they are reported to the agency through the solicitor that served the summons-----</p>

          <p eId="para_389">Yes. The person bringing the claim has to get medical evidence from the UK because no one will do it here as they are minding one another. Then he or she might have to get external legal representation because it is a specialised area and cases drag on for years. Then it is up to the agency to either go to court, settle or mediate. In the course of mediation and settlement, which are two different things, does someone from the HSE sit in on those discussions?</p>

          <p eId="para_392">The decisions on a particular case in terms of whether it is mediated, settled or the case goes to trial, reside entirely with the State Claims Agency. As to whether there are times when we are accompanied by people from the HSE or a hospital, yes they would be there, but purely in the capacity of, for example, being a medical expert or adviser.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_350">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_393">So senior people within the HSE and within the State Claims Agency are aware of cases but before a case gets to that stage everyone seems to be unaware of what is going on. That is the point. All due attention is given after the summons is served but prior to that, for example in asking for information from the HSE, not all the files are provided. In fact, I heard a solicitor say on the radio the other day that it is only when a legal firm representing the client goes to the HSE that the full disclosure will be made. I find that quite shocking, and it annoys me that it would be the case. In other cases the HSE was asked for the reports and files and it was provided with pages missing and then when it came to the stage leading to the court case the missing pages miraculously appeared on the files of the other side. The impression I get from talking to a number of people who have been through the system with the SCA is that they find it frustrating and hugely costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> One individual told me he had to put up €100,000 to be able to take part in the game, and to fight for his case, and that it dragged on for years. The messages that are going out from here are mixed. Mr. Breen said the agency shows compassion and humanity, yet people on the other side tell us that the State Claims Agency appoints solicitors to represent it and that they find it difficult to deal with the State Claims Agency and those who take cases find it hugely difficult and the process takes years. In fact, one individual told me that he felt that there was no honesty in the system, that people do not meet face to face and that there is a wall of silence within the HSE, in particular, in relation to these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I am just pointing this out because some of the commentary would lead one to believe that everything is hunky dory but it is far from it. My first question is what Mr. Breen has to say in response to that. My second question is what he says to the HSE, that has failed to report this and whose own system has failed to flag this. Will he stand with those affected who will be going through the courts with the American company? It would seem to me that the original contract was flawed; that it was the case that the Department put it in place to wash its hands of it so that it would not affect it. I believe the HSE and the State Claims Agency have a role to play. What assistance will they give to people affected?</p>

          <from> Mr. Ciarán Breen<recordedTime time="2018-05-08T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_396">In response to what you said, Chairman, about people finding us difficult, the fact of the matter is that tort law, which is the law that applies to personal injury, is just that - it is adversarial. That is why, over the years, we have done different things to try to make that better. One of the things that we did on our own initiative entirely was to bring forward the periodic payment orders, PPO, that we are making for catastrophically injured victims. We are allowing them to be paid for a period of time so that there will be absolute certainty and that families to not have to worry about money running out. That was one of the things we did.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010. We advocated PPO legislation. We advocated the pre-action protocol. If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow my colleague, Ms Foley, and I believe it would transform the behaviour and the way we handle these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">It has been in the UK for a very long time and it stops the adversarial element. People do not have to issue proceedings. They simply issue a letter of claim and we would issue a letter in response to that. The idea is that we narrow down the issues to those that are really between the two parties and then mediate them. I have advocated for this position for a very long time and despite the fact that the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into play, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have that even now. It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had that tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> To come back to the HSE, medical records and the supply of same, when a patient looks for records from a hospital obviously we are not involved. Therefore, the experience of the patient in that context is one that is beyond the State Claims Agency. Clearly, if we were asked to furnish a copy of medical records to a plaintiff we would make sure that we are furnishing all of the relevant records. Plaintiffs' solicitors will say that we are difficult to deal with and I understand that. They will say that we delay but the one thing that they will not say is that very often, when we try to settle cases at pre-defence stage or prior to a trial, the sums of money they are looking for in settlement of their clients' claims are so overstated that we have no choice in many instances but to go to the steps of the court and sometimes, to trial. I am reminded of one example where we were asked in a catastrophic injury case to pay €26 million in damages and we ended up paying €13 million after three days of trial. Clearly we could not pay out €26 million and the plaintiff's solicitor in the circumstances understood that €13 million was the value of the case ultimately. That is what we face. It is not that we want to be in court with medical negligence victims. In fact, as I said previously, if we had the pre-action protocol in place, much of what the Chairman has described in terms of frustrations would be relieved. We share those frustrations because it makes us sound bad when people say things like we are difficult but actually it is the system. It is the system that does not promote good management. I have been saying for a very long time publicly and at previous meetings of various Oireachtas committees that the tort system as it applies to medical negligence cases that we have now is not fit for the management of those cases. </p>

          <p eId="para_423">I am trying to get clarification on something. This is not the agency's direct concern but one of the big issues at stake here is whether there were differences in the detection rates of the outsourced American laboratories and the Irish laboratories that were testing the samples, as warned about by Sam Coulter Smith and the quality assurance people in the HSE who resigned in 2008. What Mr. Breen has just told us is very informative in that context. He has told us that all of the cases of misreading and failure to detect abnormal or cancerous cells in women who subsequently went on to develop cancer, and who took cases against the State, came from the American outsourced laboratories.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">That is the big news here and it says it all, frankly. The warnings issued in 2008 have proven to be correct. That is quite stunning but it has taken us until now to get to that truth. We could not get that information last week or in the Dáil today. We have to have scoping exercises and all sorts of hullabaloo but actually, we just needed to know whether the issue was with the American outsourced laboratories. We have just discovered that it was and in that context, there is almost nothing more to say. I cannot understand how those laboratories are still doing our smears.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Mr. Breen is saying that all of the cases involve American companies. He has also said - and I believe him - that the State Claims Agency would never have sought a gagging order and that it was CPL and presumably the other laboratory that were seeking gagging orders. </p>

          <p eId="para_501">I know I only have a few minutes but I thank the witnesses for the honesty with which they have approached the committee. I was watching a lot of the proceedings. The meeting has been very helpful. We will have a debate on health tonight, a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health, on which I sit, tomorrow and a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which I will chair and before which Mr. Breen will appear, on Thursday. Gradually, piece by piece, this jigsaw is coming together, and the information the witnesses have given has been helpful. As some of my colleagues, through questioning, have said, tort law is just not suitable when it comes to these cases. Mr. Breen has been very open about this, which is very useful. In a scenario in which the laboratories do not indemnify, it is almost like the State Claims Agency cannot dislodge itself. Is that fair to say? It is almost like, because of the statutory remit of the State Claims Agency and tort law, to which Mr. Breen has referred, the agency cannot dislodge itself from almost being a party to pursuing these very unfortunate people.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I think this is important for the witnesses because an awful lot is being said in the media and so on about what the State Claims Agency does. Effectively, there needs to be a change or an alteration, for want of a better to word, to its statutory remit to allow it more flexibility when it comes to these kinds of cases. Whether Mr. Breen likes it or not, if something does not change and if the laboratories do not indemnify, the State Claims Agency is left in a scenario in which it is still party to a case against these other ten women.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">The very last question, and this is important information which Mr. Breen may supply to the Chairman, is with the breakdown of the laboratories. Will Mr. Breen also supply us with the dates on which he was made aware of the ten cases or the dates on which they were lodged?</p>

          <p eId="para_548">No. The HSE, CervicalCheck and the State Claims Agency are saying that they would never take a woman into court. They would not look for a gagging clause. The problem is that it has been subcontracted. I suspect that within the original contract that was signed by CervicalCheck and the HSE with the American laboratory, they subcontracted the legal responsibility for the smear as well. We now know that the ten cases involved American laboratories. We now have a situation where the women are effectively being told that they are dealing with faceless American laboratories whose employers are the HSE, not the individual women. Based on what has now happened and the fact that there are ten cases, does Mr. Breen believe that settlements will be made out of court? Alternatively, does he believe that they will drag these women into court, or drag their families, three of the women having lost their lives?</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> The witness mentioned non-disclosure. On reflection, does Mr Breen believe that he is taking a purely legal reading of it rather than looking at it on a moral level? Take the instance of a case of someone like Vicky Phelan. If Vicky Phelan had known in 2014, she may have gone on the drug she is on now. We have to go back to the source. Will Mr. Breen, before he appears before the Joint Committee on Health, look at the contracts that were concluded between the HSE, CervicalCheck and the laboratories themselves?</p>

          <p eId="para_550">I suggest that we get a reply from Mr. Breen, because Deputy McGrath raised that earlier on, and I think Deputy Doherty raised it. What it boils down to is the role that the HSE can play in suing the laboratory and not putting the women through all of the court cases that will emerge out of this. It is to examine the documentation, the agreements between the HSE and the laboratories, the State Claims Agency's role in all of this, and to try to find a way of protecting the women and getting their rights at the same time rather than have them go to court. I know this may not be Mr. Breen's area, but it is a point that was made, and I think it is worth considering. Every effort must now be made by the State to work with the women and ensure that they get what they are entitled to, and not to have protracted court cases with this American company making life difficult and adding further cost in human terms to the individuals and the families concerned. I would urge the State Claims Agency, the Government and whoever else is involved to take on board, please, what the members are saying.</p>
