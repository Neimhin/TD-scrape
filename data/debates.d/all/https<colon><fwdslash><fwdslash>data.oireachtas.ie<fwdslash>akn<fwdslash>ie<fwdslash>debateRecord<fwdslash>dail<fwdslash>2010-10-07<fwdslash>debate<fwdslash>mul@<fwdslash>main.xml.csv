#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise an urgent matter of national importance, namely, the serious situation regarding the delays in farm payments where, in spite of every effort by farm families to have their documentation rectified and updated, major backlogs are being admitted and subsequently a sizeable number of farmers do not know when they will get paid.  Pig farmers are once again the victims of increased feed prices at €36 per tonne, and decreased product prices of between 8 cent and 10 cent per kg, and they have problems with credit to run their business.  Although we had good weather conditions, it does not follow that a rising tide lifts all boats and it is extremely urgent that the current difficulties are dealt with.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern, namely, the fact that 80 fishing vessels are currently tied up as a result of the Government's refusal to issue fishing licences.  This is mainly due to a shortage of marine survey officers, which meant that over one third of the Irish fishing fleet over 15 m in length was unable to complete the survey in order to comply with health and safety regulations.  Some were also unable to secure bank loans to assist with the survey and now have no income, with each boat having approximately four crew members who are now on the live register with owners unable to secure job seeker's allowance.  The result is that communities are suffering job losses and this is adding hardship to an already depressed sector.  There is a need for the Minister to explain why other EU states have adopted a different approach to their fishing industries.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It is more than 18 months since the Fine Gael Party put forward in the House an alternative to the banking problem in the country.  We made a particular pitch that powers be given to the Central Bank to deal with what we called a special bank resolution system, which would allow for the orderly wind down of failed banks and spread the cost of such failures more evenly between the taxpayer, professional bank investors and creditors.  The Government turned that down.Yesterday, I listened to the Financial Regulator, Mr. Elderfield, and he confirmed that such powers as would be contained in a special bank resolution system would have been of assistance to Irish authorities in dealing with the banking crisis and he said they would be necessary for imposing losses on subordinated bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  Last week, during the debate on the extension of the banking guarantee scheme, Deputy Noonan, on behalf of Fine Gael, offered the Government parties our support for the extension of a limited guarantee on condition that they would bring forward legislation by 1 November but, as always and as usual, they turned that down.  Have the Government parties reflected on the comments of the Financial Regulator yesterday?  Have they brought urgency to introducing such legislation?  When might such legislation be brought forward?On the same subject, I listened to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism the other day.  She made the point that the Government was legally prevented from negotiating with bondholders.  If that is the case, which legislation was the Minister referring to that prevents the Government from dealing with this?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Promised legislation is in order.

We were told this would open by the end of 2011 but now we have been told it will not open until 2012.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	10	That is not in order on the Order of Business and the Deputy knows that.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	14	With regard to the promised legislation referred to by the Minister for Finance in his banking statement, his Department and the Office of the Attorney General are working on resolution and reorganisation legislation, which will allow for the implementation of the reorganisation measures specific to Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  This will also address the issue of burden-sharing with regard to subordinated debt.  The Department is working with the Attorney General in order to have the legislation before the House as soon as possible.  I am not in a position to give an exact timeframe but we are hopeful and confident that this legislation can come to the House very soon.On the other issue raised, there has been protracted procurement difficulties but I am assured by the HSE that the requisite finances are available for the provision of the new unit and some preparatory work has been carried out in St. Vincent's hospital with a view to having the contract completed soon.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	15	On the matter of the cystic fibrosis unit for St. Vincent's Hospital, we had been told that this unit would be available by now.  Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House at some stage today to update the House on the exact position with regard to that unit?  We have been hearing over the past number of days the harrowing accounts of young people who have found themselves in inappropriate multi-bed wards——

I have been reading in the newspapers over the past couple of days and hearing media reports that the Cabinet decided on Tuesday that the Department of Finance would provide each of the Opposition parties with factual information on the economic and budgetary parameters to assist in the formulation of budgetary plans by the Opposition parties.  I have been reading that the Department of Finance will be writing to the Opposition parties to inform us of these arrangements.  The Labour Party has not yet received any correspondence from the Department of Finance with regard to this matter and I believe it is the same in respect of Fine Gael.  I am not making an issue of this because I presume the correspondence is in the post, other than to make the point——

My colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, has been raising the issue over a period of time about the type of information that Opposition parties need from the Department of Finance in order to address this issue.On that matter also, will the Tánaiste acknowledge, on behalf of the Government, that when the Government agreed with the European Commission the target for the reduction of Ireland's deficit to 3% by 2014, that the Labour Party and indeed, Fine Gael, voluntarily accepted that target and we have continued to accept it?  Second, will she acknowledge that of course political parties may differ on how it is to be achieved and this is a matter for resolution in the normal——

Will the Tánaiste tell the House if it is true that the National Roads Authority made an arrangement with the toll companies on a number of new motorways, the effect of which was that if the traffic levels on those motorways fell below a particular threshold——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	22	This is not in order.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	32	As I indicated to Deputy Kenny, the issue of the cystic fibrosis unit is very much a priority for the Government and the HSE.  I advised there were procurement issues which I believe can be resolved very quickly with a view to a contract being signed.  Some preparatory work has been done on the site to progress the build.  I appreciate that it is a matter of angst to all Members of the House who are of the view that this is a significant priority in the delivery of health care to those suffering from cystic fibrosis.On the issue of the Government decision on Tuesday, it is correct that the Government decided to facilitate the Opposition.  The Labour Party spokesperson requested this information on a number of occasions.  That matter is in hand.  I will ensure that Deputy Burton gets her letter very quickly.  The situation is that arrangements are being put in place in the Department of Finance for the exchange of information.  It is appropriate that consideration of proposals from the Opposition will be considered by the Government following on from those discussions.  It is a very serious matter and those facilities will be made available to members of the Opposition.I will leave the matter of the NRA to the line Minister.

There was some reference to this elsewhere yesterday.  We all understand the importance that attaches to this.  It is a fact that both the Labour Party and Fine Gael at the time voluntarily accepted those targets——

While there seems to be unanimity between the Government parties and the two, so-called main, Opposition parties, there is an Opposition voice here that acknowledges that the deficit must be addressed but which has provided an argument for a very different course to be taken.On promised legislation, will the Tánaiste say why it is, once again, that the health information Bill has been put back for yet another year?  Will she confirm that the heads of that Bill have been agreed?  Will she use her office to ensure that the heads of the Bill are circulated in the spirit in which the former Taoiseach indicated, that heads of the Bill would indeed be provided to the Opposition spokespersons and parties?  This practice has not been taken up by the Department of Health and Children.    Will the Tánaiste indicate if the health information Bill will be given a priority status, whatever that might mean within the Department or the Government, and be brought forward speedily?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The heads of the Bill were agreed by the Government in June 2009.

That is over two years ago and there has been no sight of the legislation.  It is not listed in the Government legislation programme.I refer to Nos. 89, 90 and 91 on the Government legislation programme, the road transport Bill, the sustainable travel and transport Bill and the transport infrastructure Ireland Bill.  The Government has not yet agreed the heads of the three items of legislation yet someone outside the Dáil is drawing attention to the chaos that prevails in the taxi industry as the livelihood of taxi drivers has been destroyed.  There is chaos in the office of the regulator and there is no provision for people to park.  Livelihoods are being wrecked and the heads of three items of legislation that might be amended to handle the issue of putting proper shape on road transport as it affects taxi drivers and the public have yet to be agreed by the Government.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The expected publication of the road transport Bill is next year.  It deals with the implementation of European regulations governing road transport operator licences and replacing existing road transport Acts with updated legislation.  No. 90 is the sustainable travel and transport Bill.  Work is proceeding on identifying issues that must be included in the Bill.  It is expected next year.  The transport infrastructure Ireland Bill, to provide for the merger of the NRA and the Railway Procurement Agency, is expected next year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	58	What about the air navigation Bill?

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	60	With the greatest of respect to the Tánaiste, I am quite well aware of how the Bills are described.  Anyone passing along a street in cities in this country knows the chaos that exists in respect of the taxi industry.  A further item of promised legislation came from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	64	My second question concerns the amendment of legislation from 1978 and 1988.  Two years ago the Taoiseach said he would revert to me on this issue.  He told me there was a Cabinet sub-committee on this matter and, for the information of the Tánaiste, it last met in 2009.  When the Tánaiste has identified the issue of whether we have a taxi problem, she might have another Cabinet sub-committee meeting before leaving office.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	65	In light of the fact that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, has difficulty discussing the North-South interconnector with the people concerned in County Monaghan, when will the electricity transmission (amendment) Bill, which deals with EirGrid, be introduced in the House so that we can discuss the issue in the open?In light of the great amount of money lost in red tape, estimated at €500 million, when will the companies consolidation and reform Bill be introduced?  In light of the fact that primary producers are being overpowered by the major supermarkets, which are taking the cream of the product——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I am sure Deputy Crawford will get to legislation any second.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The interconnector Bill will be dealt with next year.  The companies consolidation and reform Bill, a major item of legislation, is expected next year.  The consumer and competition Bill does not yet have a date but I know that work is ongoing in having that for the beginning of the year.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Is it not urgent?

There is much waste in HSE but this will not cost money.  Last June, coincidentally on the same day as I published a Private Members' Bill on sunbed regulation and Senator Fitzgerald did the same in the Seanad, the Minister for Health and Children published what looked like the heads of the Bill.  She provided a list of details of what would be in the Bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	76	We cannot go into detail about the public health (sunbeds) Bill.

It is way in the future with vague promises.  Can we have some clarity?  I thought the heads were agreed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Approval was given to draft that legislation.

Is the Government committed to publishing the pre-budget outlook for next year by the middle of October?  In respect of the agreement made on a four-year budgetary plan with the European Union, can the Tánaiste tell us the date of publication of this plan?  Has the Government agreed the date of 12 November with the EU Commission?A report on RTE this morning, related to the period of time the Tánaiste was——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	86	There has been a promise by Government to transfer redundancy matters fully to the Department of Social Protection and to remove it from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  Will one of the Ministers arrange to make a statement about the impact on the Aer Lingus workers?  It sounds very odd that the tax arrangements were not dealt with.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The situation is that the information normally contained in the pre-budget outlook will now be part of the four-year plan.  That four-year plan is to be brought forward and published in the first half of November.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	91	With respect to the Tánaiste, the pre-budget outlook——

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The situation is that the pre-budget outlook will now be included in the four year plan.  Therefore, the pre-budget outlook will not be available in the middle of October.  The four year plan will be made available and published in the middle of November.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	102	——I wish to take the opportunity to provide clarity.  No decision has been made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on the eligibility of Aer Lingus for a rebate.  Discussions are continuing between both parties.  That matter has not been brought to finality as of yet.  In normal circumstances a recommendation is made to the Minister to determine the eligibility of a rebate following legal advice or for that matter if the issue is sent to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The redundancy rebate and the determination as to whether it is redundancy or not is still a matter of discussion.  The issue that arose with the Revenue Commissioners is their determination under their legislation as to whether those who received redundancy packages are excluded and given an exemption as a consequence of it being redundancy.  That matter has not been clarified fully as of yet.  I will be speaking to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who will update people with regard to same.On the issue of the transfer, I believe that transfer will take place to the Department of Social Protection at the beginning of next year.

It would seem to be a very appropriate and necessary Bill at this time.  It is scheduled for publication in 2011.  In view of the economic situation, could the Tánaiste give some indication to the House as to whether any importance will be placed on bringing that forward as a matter of urgency along with two other equally relevant Bills?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Deputy Durkan should name the Bills rather than describe them.

They are self-evident as well at the moment.  One is to consolidate the body of legislation relating to the Central Bank into a single statute.  That is a very important Bill at the moment.  Publication is also expected in 2011.  The final one is the Bill to address the question of necessary changes and enhancements to the regulatory functions of the Central Bank.  Nothing could be more appropriate than that.

It was agreed to proceed with the Science Foundation Ireland legislation in July of this year and work is ongoing with the Department and the Attorney General.

Yesterday, I tabled a question on that precise issue.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	156	If Deputy Costello is not happy about the question he should discuss the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

This is a relevant matter and I need your direction on it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The response I got from the Minister is that it was exclusively a matter for the National Roads Authority.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I will answer the question directly as the Deputy put it to the Chair——

He has already told me it is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  I am not getting satisfaction in this House——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Perhaps the Deputy might seek to raise the matter by way of an Adjournment debate.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The relevant Minister is not prepared to come into the House and answer the question.  He is hiding behind the quango of the National Roads Authority.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I suggest to the Deputy that he has had a good innings.  The normal procedure is that the Deputy sits down when the Chair stands.  There are two avenues open to him; to submit a parliamentary question or table a matter for the Adjournment debate.  The relevant responsible Minister will be assigned.

I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House but I specifically and strongly support the point raised by Deputy Costello.  As you well know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, from sitting over here, this has been a cause of frustration to Members on this side of the House.  We keep raising the matter because the general public expect us to raise issues and get answers for them in the House appertaining to public expenditure.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	174	That is not a point of order.  I will try to assist Deputy Durkan if he will sit down.  If there are concerns across party benches on the way questions are answered that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the House and should be raised there.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	175	On a point of order, your interpretation, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is wrong.  It is not a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, it is a question of changing the Standing Orders of the House so that Ministers have to answer questions about quangos.  We now have some 250 quangos.  Ministers will not answer questions about them even though they are funded out of the public purse.  That is the problem, Government by quango.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	176	The Deputy is right, it is a matter for the procedures of the House and those procedures are changed through CPP.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The Dáil reform committee is a sub-committee of the CPP and reports to it but we will not resolve that matter now.  If there are genuine concerns on the answering of questions, CPP should be called in to discuss the matter.  We cannot resolve it here.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13819	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Will the Government be making any further forays into the area of animal welfare legislation?  Can the Tánaiste indicate when the animal health and welfare Bill will be introduced?  I find it strange that it is not possible to indicate the position with that Bill because commitments were given on this legislation.There are 250,000 workers who are party to defined benefit pension schemes.  They face a nightmare in terms of the returns from such schemes.  Could time be made available to the House to discuss this issue because many of the schemes are underperforming?  This is a vital issue so we should arrange a debate in this House or a discussion with the Pensions Board on the funding of those schemes.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The animal health and welfare Bill is a huge Bill.  It consolidates and updates animal health and welfare legislation for domestic and non-domestic animals.  Department officials are dealing with a large number of submissions following a consultation process and the Minister is preparing the heads of the Bill.  I will consult with the Whip about a debate on pensions.

I cannot see why it is so difficult to introduce this Bill.  When will there be progress in making sure those who sell alcohol are held accountable for it?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	182	We hope to introduce that legislation at the start of next year.  There are policy issues that have not been addressed but we are of the view that it will be available at the beginning of the year.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The Limerick local government review group has recommended to Government that the boundary to Limerick city be extended into County Clare.  When does the Tánaiste expect a date for the Government decision on that?  Could the Tánaiste assure the House that the Government will not allow the boundary of Limerick city to extend into County Clare?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	184	That matter is out for consultation at present.  I assume legislation would be required but it has not been drawn up yet.

Is it expected before Christmas?  This legislation is urgent because there is a very significant amount of waste in the legal aid system and we must put in place clear restrictions and criteria to qualify for legal aid.  The legal costs Bill has been long promised.  When will that be published and when will it be taken in the House?  Again, this relates to huge costs that are crippling the legal system.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I welcome the Minister of State to the House to take this important Bill.When it comes to child care and protection, Ireland is a nation which promises to cherish all its children equally, but it has an abysmal record.  The current Government is guilty of shameless delaying tactics when it comes to children's issues.  It continues to drag its heels on the constitutional amendment on children's rights and, despite extensive lobbying from the Opposition, this matter remains unresolved.  Perhaps the Minister of State will give some clarification today.Interestingly in the light of the revelations two days ago about the three children who were abused by their father, section 4 of the Child Care Act 1991 places an obligation on health boards, now superseded by the HSE, to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving protection and care from parents or guardians.  How can children be put into the position where one child with similar problems to her siblings was not taken into care and the others experienced ongoing abuse, even when they were under the so called protection of the HSE?  While reference was made in proceedings to the defiance of the HSE, why was such defiance not picked up on?The HSE has been found wanting in this regard.  It is unbelievable that despite a litany of such cases, protection measures are not foolproof and children continue to suffer unnecessarily from the trauma of abuse and violence.  It is too late for the long-term welfare of an abused child to bring the perpetrator to justice.  The acts have been committed, the trust broken, and the mental and emotional scars are life-long.A striking omission in the current legislation is its failure to put guidelines for GALs or guardians on a statutory footing.  The 1991 Act contains guidelines for the appointment of such guardians, who comprise the only independent evaluation mechanism in the health service, but made no provision for training, criteria for appointment or quality assurance.  It is a significant lack in the current Bill that it fails to amend the omissions of the 1991 Act.The Bill makes the situation worse, in that it proposes to limit the autonomy of the GALs and curtails their unfettered access to legal representation.  The Bill gives the courts statutory discretion over whether a solicitor will be appointed for a GAL.  This could impact adversely on a child or young person who relies on his or her GAL to put a case forward to counsel.  That the fear of liability for costs also hangs over them is an outrage to basic justice.  This issue needs to be addressed.What Bill that purports to be in the interest of the child would seek to penalise an independent person seeking to help him or her?  The message being sent out is that any opposition to the HSE will not be tolerated, even if it is in the interest of the child.  Once again, children are being made aware that there is no one to turn to for help.  This is a serious issue.Will the Minister of State explain why he has seen fit to omit the issue of after care and support for all children leaving care?  It seems that the only concern he has in this respect is one of cost.  Mandatory after care is essential and he should know that the cost to the State in the long term could be considerably reduced were proper provision for after care planned and implemented.  This is the classic case of being penny wise and pound foolish.  In this instance, it is at the expense of the young and vulnerable in our society.Section 22 of the 2009 Bill refers to after care and goes as far as to say that the HSE is to prepare and publish guidelines in respect of such care for those aged 18 years and over.  However, this in no means goes far enough.  As we know, if guidelines are to carry any weight, they must be guaranteed and followed through to positive action, yet here we have a problem.  The Minister of State, while rushing to count the cost, is not considering the long-term well-being of the individual who is currently at the mercy of an inconsistent system of after care.  Surely it is not rocket science to know that the only way to ensure a uniformity of services for after care is to include a legal entitlement to such in this Bill.The Minister of State referred to the current system as a postcode lottery when speaking in the Seanad.  Why should that situation be allowed to continue?  Given the vulnerability of young people who have been in care and the burdens and mental anguish that many will carry around for the rest of their lives, surely the likelihood of such young adults, left to their own devices without guidance, turning to drugs and crime is high.  This vulnerability should be recognised and measures put in place to allow those out of care to take their place in society in a structured and empowering manner.  Anything less is an abandonment of the vulnerable to the streets to join the statistics of the homeless and those in poverty.The Government must pledge to provide after care initiatives that develop life skills, build confidence and stress the importance of education and work programmes to allow a smooth transition to independent living.  This is highlighted by the children themselves through the complaints service provided by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  Focus Ireland has outlined the need for suitable accommodation and an out-of-hours system to protect young people who fall out of the care system before 18 years of age.  This threshold needs to be extended to 21 years.What exactly does the Minister of State understand the rights of children and young people to be?  Does he believe they have such rights?  If so, he should introduce legislation that ensures a rights-based protection service for every child in the country within the necessary statutory framework and in conjunction with a well resourced and multidisciplinary network with built in checks and balances.  Such a service would be important.What regard has been paid to the Lisbon treaty in the drawing up of this Bill?  It would appear to have been small, if not non-existent.  Where is the provision for children's rights to secure placements or to have their voices represented and heard?  If the threat to parties to proceedings, in this case the GALs, is anything to go by, the current legislation will fail our children.The Bill also fails to take regard of children's sensitivity to language.  It is clear that discussing detention in terms of child care is creating an instantaneous stigma.  In a recent debate, the Minister of State made no distinction between detention and placement and referred to "civil detention".  One of the most glaring omissions in this Bill is its failure to recognise the rights of a child to representation in cases relating to special care orders.  In this area the child in need of protection is worse off than a child in a criminal case who would have an automatic right to representation.  This is serious.  It surely infringes a child's rights to have no means of stating his or her feelings in regard to what is being decided.We live in a time that we like to think has come a long way from the Victorian era, when a child was expected to be seen and not heard.  It is time this was recognised by the courts and by legislation.  However, current practice falls short of the requirements of Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  This is an indictment of the current Government.I broadly support this legislation but I look forward to assurances from the Minister that its discrepancies will be ironed out before the Bill passes into law.  This is essentially a legal and technical Bill but I implore the Minister not to forget the human element.  The children to whom this legislation relates have often been let down by parents or guardians, by society, and, as things stand, by the State.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I am very glad to speak on this Bill, which, as the previous speaker noted, is mainly of a technical nature.  I think of the 1901 Child Care Bill and the various amendments since then which show that child care is evolving all the time in keeping with changed circumstances and the complex world in which we live, in particular the difficult and complex world in which young people live.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, for gathering everything together into this Bill.Child care — its meaning and needs — has been a constant theme running through much of the legislation introduced since this Government came into office.  I was glad to note, inter alia,  that on the same day the Minister of State spoke on Second Stage of this Bill there were health questions.  It was that day or perhaps the following one he brought a question to Cabinet about the commissioning of a single person to take charge of child care and have an overall remit.  That was a very good idea and I hope it comes to pass.  The “if” factor lies in finding the right person who will be enabled to do that work.In its nature the whole area of child care is enormous, very difficult and, in many cases, unmanageable, especially because of the numbers involved, what can happen and what has happened.  The work involves getting a grip on all of that and trying to put it into shape.  I hope the Minister of State and the HSE succeed in what they have set out to do.It would be remiss of me when dealing with a child care Bill not to speak about the plans for the referendum on children's rights.  I know I return to an old song of mine but it is one in which the Leas Cheann Comhairle, too, will be very interested.  It is within the ambit, not exactly of this Bill but of child care in general.  The Minister of State recently told me that events have moved on to a certain extent.  Various Ministers and Departments have come back with informed submissions as to how they view the matter now and what effect, beneficial or otherwise, a referendum outcome would have on the Departments in question.  I clearly understand this must be done and I hope all the Departments and Ministers have come forward with that material.  The Minister of State may be able to speak on this matter at the conclusion of the Bill.  I hope the view of the Attorney General on all the submissions so garnered will be available as soon as possible.However, it was in February of this year that the committee arrived at and published its conclusion.  I know things move slowly.  I know about festina lente and all that.  However, the way we are proceeding we are carrying on to the last vowel of festina lente.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to gather everything together and having so done be able to produce the Cabinet’s response to our work.  That done, the matter will be open for all of us but we do not want to keep remaking the wheel.  That is how I see the difficulty.  The Minister of State will come back to the committee with what has been gathered but the committee has been dissolved and is no longer a burden on the State, financial or otherwise.  We have freedom on a Wednesday evening — to do other things, not to go out and high-skite it.Governments sometimes move in such a fashion, hoping things will go off the boil and somehow people will no longer be interested in a topic.  Much of what we debate when we debate child care Bills and amendments thereto goes back very far.  A child grows up to be a teenager and a young adult and then, for one reason or another  — I hesitate to use the term "gets into trouble" — finds life not working out for him or her.  How far back in that child's life must one go before the roots of what went wrong can be traced?  So often that is the case.  One is told to go back to primary schools to take a measure.  There was a very good such measure when we started many years ago.  I hesitate to say in my time because sometimes I am so caught up in the question it will be very long ago.Home-school liaison teachers were a great incentive and have proved their worth over the years.  They were trained as teachers but do not teach.  They occupy a position liaising between the parents or, in many cases, the parent, and the school to ensure the child is secure both in his or her background and in the school environment.  Many cases were cut off at the pass that might have left a young person in greater danger, with things not working out in his or her life.  That is how it happens.  Of course, it is not enough merely to go back to primary school.  There is the education of young would-be parents who I presume start off in the main, no matter what their circumstances may be, delighted to have a pregnancy and to bear a child.  The child comes into the world then and there are families in danger of being lost along the way.  Perhaps it is time for intervention at that point.  We may have all the measures and the time and trouble taken into trying to devise structures now to deal with young people who are in need of care, as is being drawn together in this Bill, but how many such exist?  There is no way of quantifying or qualifying that number, so one does not know.  Some way should be found for governments to put a cost on intervention early care at the time they are drawing up budgets.  In the event, such figures might be included in the primary budget or perhaps the early care budget for the Department of Health and Children.  However, it is impossible to quantify because one does not know how many young people or families were helped as they went through particular times of difficulty.Incidentally, I wholeheartedly commend the early school year young children now enjoy before they enrol in primary school.  It has been a wonderful success.  I believe it was born out of financial stringency, but the result has been wonderful for children.  It is a delight for their parents as well as themselves that they have the opportunity of professional care in that very precious first year before they enter primary education.  My two children went to school when they were just  four — one in August and the other in September — and I often wondered whether I was cruel or wrong to send them at such an early age.  One went and cried all the time and the other laughed all the time, so it is probably down to the nature of the individual child.However, I believe four is a very young age for a child to go to school, whereas this preschool initiative is ideal.  I commend the Minister of State, his officials and the Department on the work put into that.  I see them every day when I am at home, or here in Dublin, trotting along with their parents, carers or guardians as they are being brought to one of these classes.  It is professional and wonderful, and gives a measure of social interaction which is a big thing for an only child or for someone from an area that is not particularly child friendly, who lives in an apartment perhaps and does not have ease of access to playgrounds, etc.  This is a very good use of money and I urge the Minister of State to endeavour to keep the beady eye of the Department of Finance off that preschool year.Having bitten the dust and come up with a far more equitable and suitable solution for some of the moneys which were not being used  for the purposes people thought they were intended, the Minister of State is to be commended in this regard.  I always called that big money that came every three months or so to young parents "fairy money".  They had not expected it but suddenly it came, and they just spent it.  However, this initiative is money well spent and I hope there are many productive years ahead regarding the preschool year.  It is so worthwhile.  I believe it will be one of those early interventions that will have results as the child grows up and goes through the primary school process where he or she will be better adjusted.  Children will be better able to stand up for themselves because bullying goes on at all ages.  They will be better able to learn and absorb and be better adjusted in both school and home life.  It is one of those early interventions which is well worth the money and the care that went into devising it.I have been in touch with the Minister of State, as he knows, to highlight the fact that in some cases there is a need for a child to have a second chance at that one-year intervention.  However, that is a separate issue and I do not intend to raise it here, apart from noting that such cases exist and deserve to be examined.Of all the places around the Cabinet table, the position held by the Minister of State, I believe, is one of great depth, complexity and responsibility.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, devised the idea that the Minister of State with responsibility for children should attend Cabinet.  In an earlier Administration, Deputy Rabbitte was the so-called "high chair" Minister of State.  In this case it is a high chair, because it is for children.  I believe, however, that of all the Ministers around the table, the burden of hope rests with the Minister of State with responsibility for children and for what he and that section of the Department of Health and Children can do for young people.  It is an onerous task, a very heavy responsibility, and I know the Government aims to do the very best it can in that regard.Regarding the referendum, I strongly believe that in years to come, the year of dalliance that we have now had for the consideration of departmental reports will bear fruit.  In the nature of things Departments do not like to take on extra responsibility.  In some cases, in terms of the wording we produced, extra responsibilities will be imposed on some Departments.  In the event, that will be for the good of children in the future so that the aura of certainty and maturity they need can surround them.  I can talk about these matters here because the Bill we are discussing goes into great detail about the method and how interventions can be made for the child's good and his or her health, moral and social development.I have listened, read and studied many things that have been said since the wording of the amendment was published.  However, I do not hold with the view vouchsafed by one particular commentator to the effect that it is an attempt by me or the Government to go into homes, snatch children and bring them away.  Who would ever wish to do that?  Anyone who comments along those lines has not analysed the meaning behind the wording.  We have been quite clear that it relates to that extra attention that can be given to a family before it might come to the pass that intervention is considered the proper and most suitable option.  I know people have different viewpoints, and I have no difficulty with that.  However, a different point of view should be based on the factual situation, not on incorrect information.I wish the Minister of State well with this Bill.  It is tidying up legislation that seeks to bring things together.  Any good housekeeper seeks to do that with his or her affairs, and that is what the Bill is about.  I am quite sure that what arises from it will be good and I look forward, quite shortly I hope, to hearing his view on the next step towards making the constitutional amendment for children a reality.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I wish to share my time with Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, with the permission of the House.I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  This is very important legislation which puts the granting of special care orders by the High Court on a statutory footing, and that is to be welcomed.  I understand that special care orders have been granted in the past by the District Court.  However, given the stature of the High Court, placing this procedure on a statutory footing provides a certainty of approach for the professionals who work in the area of child care services.Child care services, including crisis intervention, is probably one of the most difficult areas to work in and I have the height of regard for the people working in any of the professions that relate to this area given the challenges they have to undertake and the very tough decisions they sometimes have to make.  I do not believe any of us would like to find ourselves in that position very often because of the difficult circumstances surrounding many of the cases and the enormous responsibility on the shoulders of the individual who makes a recommendation on child care.We must recognise that the professionals in those fields work hard and are truly committed.  I have met a number of them over the years.  They provide care in residential homes, for example, and are faced with a range of challenges as they try to maintain a number of teenagers who are separated from their families and dealing with the emotional effects of their circumstances.  It is an extremely difficult job and we must commend them for doing such challenging work.The issue of child care was brought to the fore last year with the release of the Ryan report.  The catalogue of failures by the State detailed in the report left an indelible mark on our collective consciousness.  Surely such failure must never be allowed to happen again.  One of the most distressing aspects of the report was the fact that children, when their time in an institution was finished, were simply let go to fend for themselves in a world for which they were completely unprepared.  It is unconscionable now that a young adult, having just turned 18 and without any support network, would be allowed to find his or her own way in the world.  Indeed, it was a recommendation of the Ryan report that children who have been in State care should have access to support services once they leave direct care.  In light of past failings by the State, legislation must now be framed to ensure that the best interests of the child are always at the centre of the legislation.  The Bill is moving in that direction, which I welcome.The Seanad debates on this legislation showed widespread agreement on the importance of after-care services.  The six Labour Party Senators proposed a comprehensive after-care programme that could be tailored to suit the needs of individuals needing care.  It is the type of programme that should be at the heart of any new recommendations, because the needs of each child are different.  I acknowledge that this will be time-consuming and possibly costly in the short term, but it is important that the needs of individuals are taken account of.  The current legislation, while not explicitly containing a requirement for after-care services, does state that where after-care is required, a plan should be prepared and implemented.  Senator Alex White made the point that after-care should be guaranteed on the basis that when a decision is made on the need for provision of such care, it is impossible to foresee what may happen to a person leaving care and, as such, it should be a mandatory process with continuous monitoring of such persons in order to afford them preventative help should they require it.A child who may not feel he or she wishes to avail of support services at 18, for example, may realise later that he or she is in an entirely new environment and does have a need for support.  Depending on the kind of background or institution he or she has come from, the person may have no capacity to survive in the world or deal with any challenges.The Minister of State stated in the Seanad debate that once need has been established, the legislation requires the HSE to provide after-care services.  He also stated that he would consider moving this out of the realm of interpretation into a more literal expression of the intentions of the Oireachtas in this area.  I would like to be assured that further consideration has been given to this idea since the Seanad debate.We know from research done by Focus Ireland that persons who leave care and are not provided with support services have a higher risk of becoming homeless, becoming involved in criminality or developing addiction problems.  There is an obligation on us to provide these children with the necessary after-care supports, whether it is education, housing, guidance, emotional support or even just follow-up visits to see how they are faring after their time in care.  I recognise the legislation requires the provision of after-care where there is a need but when the provision of a service such as after-care support is discretionary, there is always the possibility of a child's falling through the cracks.I ask the Minister of State whether the financial impact of the provision of guaranteed services is a factor in determining whether the provision of such services should be mandatory.  The reason I ask is that in many estimations of the cost of potential public expenditure, there is a failure to appreciate the cost of not spending the money.  If after-care support is not provided, the State may end up paying much more in dealing with the effects of homelessness, criminality or other potential consequences of a lack of support, not to mention the cost to the child who has been overlooked and forgotten.This legislation is a vehicle through which the State may intervene if the welfare of a child is at risk or if a child is a risk to him- or herself.  It is important, however, to consider preventative measures.  Everybody who has spoken on this will agree that intervention and preventative measures — which can be used to avert the requirement for a child to be taken away from its family — are important.  It is also universally agreed that children should be taken into care only as a last resort.  This implies that the situation must be unbearable or intolerable for the child and, for one reason or another, the child is at serious risk.In my constituency area of Ballyfermot there was a recent pilot programme called Strengthening Families, run by the Ballyfermot STAR organisation, which provides guidance and education to drug users, their families and the community.  This programme provided substantial social interventions for a pilot group of ten or 11 families.  The interventions took the form of ordinary, practical things, but counselling was also provided and families were followed through.  When reports were relayed back from those families, the outcome was found to be one of enormous success.  Credit is due to Ballyfermot STAR for having organised it.The project provided professional support to the families of drug users in the form of a skills training programme to improve family relationships, parenting skills and children's social skills and behaviour.  Families were encouraged, for example, to sit down for a family meal once or twice a week.  Ordinary things that others might take for granted were unfamiliar, unfortunately, to these families.  The results for the families were positive and encouraging.  By intervening early, the programme reduced the risk of child neglect in high-risk families where drug use was an issue.  The evidence from international trials of this method is also positive.  I support the idea that initiatives such as this, which provide early intervention and family supports, be considered and supported as a means to prevent the need to adopt many of the measures outlined in the legislation.  Such measures may be useful as a means of after-care support if a child, for example, wishes to return to live with his or her biological parents.  The project in Ballyfermot was particularly successful from that point of view.The State must not fail vulnerable children ever again.  The spectre of the Ryan report hangs heavily over many people in this country and, unfortunately, will continue to do so for some time.  I must say, with some regret, that I am all too familiar with cases of children who are clearly at risk in my own constituency and who are open to exploitation by unscrupulous people who have no regard for the law and, more unfortunately, for the well-being of children.  The children do not have caring families, for a variety of reasons, but when it comes to protecting them, the State is going in slow motion.The issue of before-care must not be neglected either.  It is timely to consider the supports and services that are available for such children.  I fully agree with Deputy O'Rourke's point about intervention at a very early stage, which I believe is the only way to go.  We must establish support structures from the earliest stage.  Parents must know how to look after their children.  If they are not, for whatever reason, able to do that constructively without intervention, then such intervention must be put in place.

It is a complex and technical Bill and will likely receive little attention from the wider public and even less in the news media.  All the more reason, then, for it to be properly debated and scrutinised in the Houses of the Oireachtas.A number of significant gaps have been identified in the Bill by those working on the front line in this area, and the Government should listen carefully to those informed concerns.It needs to fill the legislative gaps and the gaps in service provision accordingly.  I hope the Government agrees to adopt the constructive amendments that will be tabled on Committee Stage.The context of this Bill is a greater focus than ever before on the legal rights of children.  The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, on which I served, worked very hard and produced a significant body of work but its recommendations now need to be acted upon.  Above all, we need to see the Government proceeding with the referendum to insert strengthened rights for children in the Constitution.It would be far better if we were considering this Bill with the constitutional amendment on children already in place.  At the very least we should have a clear Government commitment to hold the referendum and within a stated timeframe.  Regrettably, that is something we yet do not have.  The Government says it has a range of concerns about the wording agreed by the committee.  The Government was represented on the committee and had all the advice available to it then that it has now and which it claims is urging hesitation and delay.  From our point of view as Opposition voices a postponement of the referendum may yet occur.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, but the situation regarding the referendum casts a shadow over this Bill and its passage.  The Government can remove that cloud to some extent by ensuring that a much improved Bill emerges from Committee Stage and I so urge.Leadership is needed, not only in terms of legislation but in ensuring reform and improvement in the delivery of services.  Over the summer we had the shocking report by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA,  on the quality, safety and management of HSE foster care services in Dublin.  The most damning finding was that the problems were known for years but were not addressed, thus exposing, as stated in the report, "serious deficiencies in the effectiveness, accountability, governance and management of these services, and the lack of emphasis on a child-centred culture at all levels of the HSE, but more significantly at senior management level".  The HSE was found deficient in its vetting, assessment and approval of foster carers, particularly relative carers.HIQA also raised serious concerns about child protection practices.  The fact that these findings were made about two Dublin areas but that a third area was found to be mostly safe and well organised emphasises the need for management in the culpable areas to be held accountable.  It beggars belief that no action was taken by the HSE against management in the two Dublin areas where HIQA found massive management failures that endangered children.  HSE managers are to remain unaccountable.  That is totally unacceptable to this Deputy and the party I represent.The HIQA report raised wider questions about the ability of the HSE to fulfil its child protection responsibilities and exposed the failure of Government in both child protection strategy and the provision of resources.  It is against that background that we consider the extensive powers and responsibilities of the HSE as reaffirmed in this Bill.  Those powers and responsibilities must be exercised within an ethos of accountability in which the child always — I emphasise always — comes first.  Ultimately it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure the HSE is doing its job properly.The Minister of State needs to listen very carefully to the considered submissions of a range of responsible organisations who have raised concerns and proposed improvements in this Bill.  They have the first-hand knowledge and expertise that comes from working with the children for whom this legislation is primarily intended.Prominent among the recommendations for an improved Bill is the call for a statutory right to aftercare.  Focus Ireland has done much work in this area and is to be commended for its efforts.  There is surely no valid counter-argument to the call for the HSE to be required in this legislation to ensure that there is after-care provision for young people leaving care at the age of 18, should they actually require it.I understand the Minister of State has suggested that only a small minority leaving the care system need such aftercare.  Even if this were the case it would be no argument against making aftercare a statutory right for the people concerned and an obligation on the HSE in the first instance.  The Minister of State's contention that it is only a small minority does not stand up to scrutiny.  I reject that claim.  The case for a statutory right to aftercare has been made comprehensively and is, I believe, irrefutable.  Its absence can only add to the tragically growing numbers of young people experiencing homelessness, addiction and a life of misery after they are abandoned by the care system when they reach 18 years of age.There is a range of other concerns that have been raised and need to be addressed.  Time does not permit an exposition on each of them but I will mention some of the main points.  A set of complex problems have been identified in regard to the provisions of guardian  ad litem services.  In summary what is needed is reform of the guardian ad litem system to better represent and protect children and to ensure that their voices are heard.  The Bill does not go far enough in that regard.  I urge the Minister of State to engage directly with the appropriate organisations, Focus Ireland, Barnardos, the Irish Association of Young People in Care and the Irish Foster Care Association on this aspect of the Bill.Clarification is sought as to whether section 23NF of the Bill requires the HSE to obtain a High Court order before removing the child from this jurisdiction.  There is a need to develop a therapeutic dimension to special care.  I recommend to the Minister of State that a new section be inserted in the Bill to place an absolute responsibility on the State to accommodate all young people appropriately, taking account of their needs.  I deplore the recent return to a mentality that would rather clamp down on homeless young people for begging on the street than address the causes of homelessness and the needs of the homeless.The Bill should be used as an opportunity to place the 2004 regulations on the operation of special care units into primary legislation.  Concern has also been expressed about the Bill's removal of the obligation on the HSE to convene family welfare conferences.  Perhaps the Minister of State would address this and the other concerns I have raised when he concludes the debate on this Stage.The Sinn Féin Deputies are happy to support the Bill and we urge the Government to take on board the constructive proposals for its improvement and enhancement.  It is not about making us happier that he would do this, it is about ensuring we have legislation that will be fit for purpose and that will make a real difference in the lives of those who most need our help and support.

I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Child Care (Amendment) Bill.  It is an important and timely debate and it is right and proper that we should give it the time it deserves in the House.We are seeking to minimise the tragic circumstances that befall some young people in our country.  These circumstances are often highlighted in the media but they can have the potential to destroy the lives of some of these young people.  The publication of the Ryan and Murphy reports shocked us to our very core.  Innocent young children were cruelly treated and abused at the hands of those who were supposed to care for them and who purported to have their best interests at heart.  The treatment was criminal.  It was inhumane.  It was totally unacceptable to society and the net result was the lives of many young people were destroyed and a blight put on their futures.We are called to ensure that the likes of this will never happen again and that we will never be in a situation where we are standing up speaking about such abhorrent crimes.  Any Bill that offers protection, support and assistance to vulnerable children is certainly to be welcomed.  This Bill seeks to offer that protection and support to these children.  Many of them are vulnerable through no fault of their own.  Many have only known a life of dysfunction, where normality is something that is completely alien to them.This Bill allows the HSE to apply to the High Court for a special care order for a child between 11 and 17.  This is always done in the best interests of the child and it must be as a last resort.  Special care will provide the child with care that addresses his or her behaviour and the risk of harm it poses to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare, while also including medical and psychiatric assessment, examination, treatment and educational supervision.  That is to be welcomed because it gives these children a second chance and it is in their best interests.State care can be traumatic for these children as they are removed from what is normal for them.  They need care and support.  Their time spent in care should ensure that when they leave and return back to the big bad world, that they are in a better place than when they left it and entered State care.  I believe that aftercare is very important for them.  If aftercare is not good, they may quickly regress and all the good work might be undone.  Somebody made the point to me that one does not take away the soother and the comfort blanket from children in the one day.  They have to be weaned little by little.  While I would not advocate a culture of dependency, I would say that these children need the support and assistance of the service providers to allow them  and grow into independent and confident young people.  This will require different interventions and different time scales, depending on each individual.  No two cases are the same, but there must be consistency across the country in the provision of aftercare to ensure that the same high standards apply.It is important to recognise that the families require support and assistance to enable them to cope.  It is very difficult for families to cope with young people whose behaviour is challenging, and these families deserve to be supported.  Being a parent is the one job in life for which there is little training.  Parents bring home their new baby and they have to figure it out as they go along.  Dealing with children who have challenging behaviour and who pose difficulties in the family setting is very difficult.  It is not a sign of weakness for people to say that they cannot cope and that they need help.  The HSE and the social services are there to help and will provide support and assistance to those families who need it.I listened to Deputy Blaney's contribution on Tuesday and I agree with his commentary on education.  As someone who was involved in education, we have a tremendous gift.  The little ones go to school at the age of four and they are like sponges.  Everything teacher says is correct.  We have a huge gift as we are able to transform their young minds and turn them into positive individuals, who in turn will make a valued contribution to society.  I do not think our teachers get enough credit for the excellent work that they do.  There often tends to be negative commentary about them in the media, as there is about other sectors of the public service.  They do a tremendous job and they have shaped us as individuals for generations.  They continue to do that with the young people of today.I also want to echo Deputy O'Rourke's sentiments about the free preschool year.  It has been widely welcomed by all.  It has been a tremendous initiative.  I like the aspect where access is provided to all.  Every child is treated equally and is able to avail of it.  It helps children with their socialisation and it makes transition into primary school easier.  One such preschool has been set up in my own parish recently.  My children did not have the luxury of going to preschool because it did not exist.  Now there are far more providers and the facilities are excellent.  I see the little ones heading in there full of enthusiasm and happy to be going there.  They even wonder on Saturday and Sunday why they cannot go.  That helps with their transition into primary school.I join with others in commending the Minister of State.  I know that he has listened carefully to the various organisations, including Focus Ireland, and that he will take their views into consideration.  He has always been available to listen to those who represent the voices of our children and that is to be commended.  As a member of the joint committee dealing with the constitutional referendum on children, I am aware that he attended every meeting.  He listened to everything that was said.  While I understand that there are complex legal issues in drafting the wording for a referendum, I would look forward to it being brought before the people as soon as possible.I commend the Minister of State on the commitment he has shown in dealing with children's issues.  I welcome the Second Reading of this Bill and the opportunity it provides to Deputies on all sides of the House to express their views.  While I do not have the legal training, I know of the incidences that I have come across before and during my time in this House.  That makes the passing of this Bill a priority for all of us.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  I am happy to speak in support of the Bill before the House today.  I compliment the Minister of State on bringing this socially enlightened Bill before the Oireachtas.  The proposed legislation is timely and I believe it represents a sensitive, fair and proper balance in reconciling the personal rights and liberties of a vulnerable child while also having due regard to the need for a third party to protect and uphold those rights in instances where it is necessary to have positive State intervention to promote the essential integrity and welfare of the child who may be at risk.The Bill sets out a practical statutory framework and an exhaustive procedure to be adopted.  It permits the HSE to apply to the High Court for special care orders to detain children who are in need of special care services.  This type of detention is sought only as a last resort and where other forms of residential or community care are regarded as unsuitable or ineffective.  The objective of such a drastic but necessary measure is to provide a supportive and stabilising period for a child.  During that period, the child and his or her family receive the constructive support of a range of professional services from social care workers, psychologists, social workers and teachers.  Each child has a specially devised care plan which is developed to meet individual needs and difficulties, and the application of this tailored plan is monitored and supervised by the HSE.The Child Care Act 1991 was amended by the Children Act of 2001 and that legislation allowed for applications for special care orders to be heard before the District Court.  At present, under its constitutional power of inherent jurisdiction, the High Court hears applications for children to be detained so that special care can be afforded to them by the Health Service Executive.By definition, special care necessitates the civil detention of a child and that detention is secured in the best interests of the child's welfare, which is always the paramount consideration.  The detention involves protection in a special care unit where suitable educational supervision and the necessary therapeutic supports are put in place for the child.  This is conducted in a safe and secure environment which is conducive to the child's rehabilitation and adjustment.  The objective of special care is to provide a period of structured and planned care to enable and equip that child to return to less secure care as soon as possible, or, if appropriate, to return to the family home.  Under a special care order, the HSE effectively acts in loco parentis.  It assumes full responsibility for the child as if it were a parent of the child and it is required to promote and protect the child’s health, development and overall welfare.The Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 will give legislative force to the High Court powers in respect of applications for child care orders.  It will have original statutory jurisdiction to hear applications by the HSE for special care orders or interim special care orders and other related matters in respect of children where their welfare and well-being may require their detention in a special care unit.  The Bill also provides that special care units will be rigorously inspected within the scope of the Health Act 2007.  The Bill also proposes to dissolve the Children Acts Advisory Board which I support and which is fully consistent with stated Government policy on the imperative to achieve efficiencies and to rationalise Stage agencies.The Bill is comprehensive and sets out in some detail the exact legal procedures to be observed throughout this delicate process from considering the child for special care, the application for the order, the hearing of the case, the granting of the order, the care of the child under the order, right through to the ultimate discharge of the order.  In assessing objectively whether a child requires special care, the HSE must be absolutely satisfied that the behaviour of the child poses a real and substantial risk to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare.  The Bill then allows the HSE to apply to the High Court for a special care order for a child who is aged between 11 and 17 years.The Bill also provides for various circumstances where the child is, or has been, the subject of criminal proceedings and it includes precise provisions whereby the HSE may apply for a special care order or may continue to provide special care where a child has been charged with an offence.  The HSE may also apply for a special care order for a child who has been found guilty or has been convicted of a criminal offence and where, following that conviction, a custodial sentence was imposed and that sentence has been served.The HSE may also apply for a special care order, or may continue to provide special care, where: a suspended custodial sentence has been imposed on a child; the making of a children detention order has been deferred or has been suspended; or a Children Act order has been made in respect of a child.  The HSE shall not, however, apply for a special care order, or where a special care order is in place it shall apply to the High Court to discharge it, where a child is remanded in custody or where a custodial sentence is imposed on a child.  The HSE is obliged to make arrangements to allow the child, who is the subject of a special care order, to meet any person for the purpose of his or her legal representation, and for the child's attendance in court on any criminal charge.In any proceedings provided for under this Bill, the High Court is required to have cognisance of the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, and to regard the welfare of the child as the primary and paramount consideration and, in so far as is practicable, to give consideration, in light of the child's age and understanding, to the express wishes of the child.  The High Court may order that the child be joined as a party to the proceedings and may make an order appointing appropriate legal representation for the child.  The Bill also provides that, where the child is not a party to the proceedings, the High Court may, where it is satisfied that it is necessary in the child's interest, appoint a guardian ad litem for the child and the High Court has discretion to appoint legal representation for the guardian ad litem.Where a special care order has effect, the Bill provides that the HSE shall have the like control over the child as if the HSE were a parent of that child and may do what is reasonable to promote and protect the child's health, development and welfare, and has the authority to decide on the nature of the special care to be provided to the child.  The HSE is also vested with the authority to give consent to any medical or psychiatric examination, treatment or assessment which the child may need.  The HSE is also given the authority to give consent to the application for, and the issuing of, a passport for the child.A special care order will cease to have effect when a child reaches the age of 18 years.  A special care order may be of up to three months duration and the High Court may grant, on an application by the HSE, up to two extensions and each may be up to a maximum of three months duration.  Accordingly, the maximum duration of a special care order will nine months in total.  The High Court will continue to have an ongoing supervisory role and will undertake a review, in each four-week period for which the special care order has effect to consider whether the child continues to require special care to adequately address his or her conduct or behaviour, the risk of harm to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare which may be posed by that behaviour, and individual care requirements for the child will be appraised.The HSE may apply to the High Court for an interim special care order for a period of up to 14 days, including any period which has been granted on foot of an ex-parte application for an interim special care order, which can be extended by the High Court on application by the HSE up to a further 21 days.  An ex-parte application for an interim special care order may be made to the High Court by the HSE for a period of up to eight days and this cannot be extended.The High Court may make an order for the purpose of executing a special care order directing a person, having custody of the child, to deliver the child to the custody of the HSE or directing the Garda Síochána to search, find and deliver the child into the custody of the HSE.  The Bill also provides that the High Court may issue a warrant authorising the Garda Síochána to enter — by force if necessary — any house or other premises where the child is thought to be for the purpose of executing a special care order.Where the High Court makes a special care order, it may, in the interests of justice or the protection of the child, give directions in respect of a named person or persons, which may include a parent, a guardian or a person acting in loco parentis, on the withholding of the special care unit’s address and the access of persons to the child while the child is resident in the special care unit.The Bill provides for an amendment to section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Currently a garda can enter a building without a warrant if there is not sufficient time to make an application for an emergency care order and there is immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of the child.  The effect of the amendment to section 12 is that a garda, who believes that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child, can also enter a building without a warrant if there is not sufficient time in the circumstances to obtain a warrant under section 35 of the Child Care Act 1991 to execute an order which has been made by a justice directing that a child be placed or maintained in the care of the HSE.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate yesterday and today, following the discussions in the Seanad in the previous term.  I preface my comments on special care and foster care generally by pointing out as mentioned by other Deputies that the vast majority of children in foster care and special care do extremely well.  They have great outcomes.  They are all achieving educationally and socially and are preparing for life in a very good way.  Foster care is often described as ordinary people doing extraordinary things for some of the most vulnerable children and while it is natural that a great deal of negative publicity surrounds this area, we must remind ourselves constantly that, for the thousands of children, care provided via the Health Service Executive and foster parents is of the first order in this country and children do extremely well.The main objective of the Bill is to safeguard the best interests of children, and specific issues have been raised in that regard during the course of the debate.  Deputy Flanagan raised an issue specifically in regard to section 23ND, which deals with the functions of the HSE providing special care and section 23NF, which deals with the release of a child from special care for medical purposes outside the State.  Among other things, it provides that the High Court may vary the special care order accordingly, and section 23NF(15) states that the High Court is required to satisfy itself of all factors related to the welfare of the child before it varies a special care order.The question of guardians ad litim was raised by a number of Deputies.  The Bill provides that the court may provide a guardian ad litim to the child if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so.  In practice, guardians ad litim are appointed in all special care cases.  Deputy Flanagan raised that issue.  It is true to say that guardians ad litim are not appointed in all care applications but they are appointed in all special care cases.Last year, I launched the Children Act Advisory Board's guidance on the subject of guardians ad litim, and I continue to have discussions about the way those recommendations can be acted upon.  I said we would see how that guidance worked in practice before we would move to act on other commitments in this area.The Bill also provides that the HSE may enter into an agreement or arrangement with a person under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 for the provision of a special care unit by a service provider from the private or voluntary sector.  Some Deputies spoke about that with concern.  I have met some of the private providers and far from the characterisation of them being fly by night in any sense, they are very committed and thorough.  I can confirm that such an arrangement, if it is made by the HSE, for a special care unit to be provided will be subject to the same standards and regulations made under the Health Act 2007 for the inspection by HIQA.  In addition, the HSE is required to supervise and monitor the special care unit under such an arrangement, and a child placed in a unit provided under such an arrangement will remain in the custody of the HSE.Other issues were raised in the debate.  Deputy Flanagan asked the reason the Ballydowd unit remains open considering that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recommended that it be closed.  The reason is that it is very difficult to provide alternative accommodation at this time.  I visited Ballydowd last month.  There were three young boys there and I had a chat with them.  They were quite happy that they were being well looked after.  All of the reviews of Ballydowd that pointed out the problems regarding the build environment of that unit have stated also that the children are well aware of their rights, they get a very good education, at all times their detention is supervised by the High Court and they are provided with social workers and interventions, as appropriate.  However, the HSE remains determined that Ballydowd be closed.  In the meantime, refurbishment works are going on; I saw them when I visited last month.  However, there will probably be an increase in demand for special care in the coming years and, therefore, it provides the HSE with a challenge to meet the increased capacity and requirement that will exist.  The HSE has also met and consulted with HIQA on this matter regarding the closure of Ballydowd.The issue of aftercare was raised by a number of Deputies, including Deputies Upton and Ó Caoláin among others.  I made mention of that in the Seanad previously and it concerns the issue of section 45 of the Child Care Act.  It departs as an issue from what we are discussing in this legislation because we are dealing with special care specifically.  Aftercare applies to all care situations where a child is in foster care, residential care or some other form of care.  Nevertheless, it is a live issue.  I often say that if we are to learn anything from the Ryan report we must recognise that many children who come from care backgrounds can have difficulties later in life and unless we provide for a strong, statutory transition period between childhood and adulthood we will be turning a deaf ear to the obvious testimonies that are detailed in the Ryan report.For that reason, I have obtained legal advice to the effect that the requirement to have aftercare is a mandatory one where it is determined that the need is present.  In other words, an assessment is done before the child leaves care and if there is a requirement for aftercare it must be provided.  It has a mandatory element to it, therefore.  That legal advice is being disseminated to the HSE by my office.  The HSE is currently working on an aftercare protocol for the entire country to ensure we can avoid the point made by Deputy Upton that we have a postcode lottery in terms of where one lives and whether one gets aftercare.Furthermore, as mentioned in my original contribution, in last year's budget the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, committed a sum of €15 million to ensure the implementation of the recommendations in the Ryan report and included in that €15 million was €1 million specifically for aftercare.  In the national service plan of the HSE for 2010 that expenditure is to include the recruitment of ten aftercare workers and non-pay associated costs; a financial support package for young people moving into aftercare from foster care, residential care and supported lodgings; the maintenance and refurbishment of existing aftercare premises; and the funding of the Irish Association of Young People in Care to develop a national advocacy and support service for young people in care, leaving care and aftercare, to include the recruitment of six staff and associated non-pay costs.  Between those three initiatives — the protocol, the new legal understanding of section 45 of the Child Care Act and the funding which will provide extra staff and better premises — I believe we will have better outcomes and a better transition between those children who have left care and them achieving adulthood.Deputy Flanagan inquired as to whether there was consultation with stakeholders.  I assure him that I have ongoing consultation with the stakeholders at all times.  I do not believe I could be accused of having a closed door policy towards anybody who wishes to raise issues with me.A number of additional issues arose in this debate.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the referendum.  As I said last week in a separate situation, the position is that we have gone through a very detailed process with each of the Departments looking at the substance of the recommendations from the committee.  It is my determination to respect the wording as set out by the committee but it is important that we must be determined that we will not have any unintended consequences.  We have seen where that went wrong in the early 1980s where something can be put into the Constitution that has consequences that can come back to haunt us subsequently.  We need to get that right but we are making substantial progress in this area.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised that issue as well.Regarding social workers, Deputy Flanagan made the point that they do exceptionally difficult work.  There was an excellent programme on the BBC this week which I would recommend to anybody who wishes to get a good grounding in what happens in care situations, the tough backgrounds and difficult families that some children come from and the extraordinarily difficult choices social workers have to make.  It was a one hour documentary called "Kids in Care", which was revealing and uplifting to a great extent.  It highlighted how dedicated people are in trying to improve these children's lives.On legal costs, Deputy Flanagan raised the question of why senior counsel are going into the District Court.  It is required under the legislation that the jurisdiction of the District Court is used and if we change that to the Circuit Court or the High Court we would increase costs and not decrease them, which was his concern.  I have been reassured by the HSE that it is tendering for this work for legal services in respect of care proceedings, which should have a dramatic impact.I echo what Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Connaughton had to say about the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  It offers us a huge opportunity to develop early intervention methodologies for children who present with any kind of early difficulties, particularly in their more formative years, than has been possible.  We also have a much smaller ratio of children to carers in this situation as opposed to in primary school.  It is, therefore, a wonderful opportunity to identify problems early on.Deputy Naughten raised the general issue of whether the HSE is fit for purpose with regard to children in family services.  As I have said previously, the HSE is uniquely positioned, through its primary care strategy, to provide children in family services with a way of ensuring a link in to other services, such as psychologists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, that are needed to enhance children's lives and provide for proper early intervention.I will conclude on the question of the purpose of the legislation, which many speakers have said is technical and complicated.  It clarifies some of the issues up to now.  In particular, it gives a statutory basis for what the High Court has been doing for the past few years on the basis of its inherent jurisdiction.  It gives much greater clarity as to the basis upon which special care orders can be made and allows for much longer special care or detention than has been the case up to now.  In my discussions with some of the managers of these units around the country, they have said that if we could provide a more stable placement or period of detention and for better interventions.  It is not just about a place of safety or warehousing a child.  One must be able to do something and intervene in some way.  It will be good if a longer period of detention, with all the safeguards of constant High Court observation of the detention, can result in better outcomes.Up to now the situation has been that if a child is subject to any kind of criminal proceedings, a special care order cannot be sought or continued with.  This sometimes allowed the HSE to wash its hands of a difficult case, simply because a criminal proceeding had commenced.  This will no longer be the case.  Even if a child has been convicted and given a sentence short of detention, a special care order or an application for one can continue.  This means the criminal justice system and the care system are not separated.  From now on the service must wrap around the child and we will no longer have the situation where the child's circumstances must suit the service.  It is the other way around.  This is a profound difference and it is very satisfying to see there is broad acceptance for this principle in both the criminal justice and care systems.  This provision should be a model for how these two systems should operate together for the benefit of children.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to Committee Stage.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The principal purpose of this Bill is to make further provision in domestic law for the State's obligations under the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, as well as relevant elements of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 of 2004.  The Geneva Protocol banned the use in war of poisonous gases, as well as bacteriological methods of war.  Ireland acceded to the protocol in 29 August 1930.  The protocol was supplemented in much greater detail by the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.  Most poisonous gases are what today are referred to as chemical weapons and their development, production, stockpiling and use are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, which also requires the destruction of any existing chemical weapons.  Extensive provision for the State's obligations under that convention was made by the Chemical Weapons Act 1997.The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention prohibits the use, production, development, stockpiling and transfer of biological weapons, extensively supplementing the 1925 protocol in so far as it applies to biological weapons.  It was signed and ratified by Ireland in 1972 and entered into force on 26 March 1975.  Resolution 1540 was adopted by the United Nations Security Council in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 with the primary aim of preventing weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons, falling into the hands of terrorist organisations and other non-state actors.  The Biological Weapons Bill will create specific offences relating to the use, production and possession of biological weapons.The use of poisonous and asphyxiating substances as weapons has been prohibited since before the First World War, although unfortunately that did not stop some countries from using poisonous gases during that war.  In 1925, the Geneva Protocol reasserted its prohibition and extended it to the use of biological methods of warfare.  However, the 1925 protocol contained a number of weaknesses.  Most importantly, it prohibited only the use of gases and bacteriological methods of warfare, but did not ban their development, production or stockpiling.  Also problematic was the fact that many states party to the protocol reserved the right to retaliate in kind if attacked with prohibited weapons.  Despite the weaknesses of the Geneva Protocol, however, the use of biological weapons during the Second World War was limited.During the Cold War period, an increasing number of countries developed biological warfare research programmes, the largest of which were conducted by the then Soviet Union and the United States.  Anthrax, smallpox and plague were among the diseases researched for use as weapons.  It was not until the late 1960s that attempts were made to control this type of biological weaponry.  In 1969, the then US President Nixon announced the unilateral dismantlement of the US offensive bio-weapons programme.  Shortly thereafter negotiations on a new global instrument to supplement the 1925 Geneva Protocol began at the conference of the committee on disarmament in Geneva.  These negotiations resulted in the conclusion in 1972 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons.Today, no state acknowledges that it possesses biological weapons or that it has a programme to develop such weapons.  The stigma attached to the use of such weapons and their prohibition under the convention have been strong deterrents.  This has not, however, completely allayed concerns with regard to bio-weapon development by states.  For instance, it was alleged in the early 1990s, by Soviet defectors, that the former Soviet Union had conducted a vast, clandestine biological weapons programme.  Iraq, also a party to the convention, was found in 1995 to have had a considerable undeclared biological warfare programme.There are several reasons the greatest threat arising from biological agents today may come not from states but from terrorists or other non-state actors.  Biological agents are relatively cheap to develop and produce, although they are much more difficult to create as weapons and deploy.  Facilities for researching and producing biological agents are easier to hide than the facilities for producing other weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, the equipment involved in the production of biological agents has many legitimate civilian uses.  Fortunately there have been very few instances of biological weapons use by non-state actors, the most notorious and recent being the anthrax attacks in the Washington DC area in 2001.  In September and October of that year, several cases of anthrax, which when inhaled and left untreated has a fatal outcome in humans, broke out.  Letters containing anthrax spores were posted to several news media offices and to the offices of two members of the United States Senate.  The attacks killed five people and infected 17 others, demonstrating how easy it is to cause mayhem with such weaponry.  There was widespread fear and panic which crippled the postal service and forced the evacuation of federal buildings, including Senate offices and the Supreme Court.  Sales of gas masks rocketed.The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a hybrid instrument of international humanitarian law and disarmament and non-proliferation and it was the first multilateral treaty banning the production and use of an entire category of weapons.  The convention bans the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition and retention of microbiobrial or other biological agents or toxins, in types and in quantities that "have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes".   The convention currently has 163 states parties and 13 other signatories.  The most noteworthy states currently not party to the convention are Israel, Egypt and Syria, although the latter two are signatories and, therefore, under the international law of treaties, are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the convention.Review conferences are held every five years to review the operation and implementation of the convention, taking into account new and relevant scientific and technological developments.  A 2001 draft verification protocol to the convention would have required states parties to declare relevant facilities and submit to inspections but this was rejected by the US Administration at the time and the negotiations on the protocol were subsequently discontinued.  However, the sixth review conference held in Geneva in 2006 established the implementation support unit, ISU, to assist states parties with the implementation of the convention.  At the seventh review conference in 2011, states parties to the convention will review the operation of the ISU.Fortunately, biological weapons have only rarely been used.  Their development, production and deployment entail numerous and serious hazards for those trying to use them.  Nevertheless, it has long been recognised that if these difficulties can be overcome biological weapons have the capacity to kill thousands of people and to sow hysteria and panic in the general population.  A biological weapon delivers to its target a biological agent, which causes infection or allergy, or the toxic product of a biological agent called a "toxin" which causes poisoning.  Biological agents are usually either bacterial or viral.  Biological agents may also produce toxins.  Although toxins are not capable of replicating themselves, they are nevertheless poisonous.  Botulism, which is produced from the bacterium that grows in improperly handled or prepared meat products, and ricin, which occurs in the seed of the castor oil plant, are examples of virulent toxins.  Toxins also occur everywhere in nature, for example, the venom of a spider or a snake.Accordingly, the negotiators of the convention prohibited the production and use of biological agents by reference to the purpose or intent of the producer or user.  The prohibition laid down therefore extends to all biological agents and toxins unless they are intended for peaceful purposes and unless their types and quantities are consistent with such purposes.  The main provisions of the convention are as follows: Article I defines the scope of the convention's prohibition, the so-called general purpose criterion.  This includes all microbiobrial and other biological agents or toxins and their means of delivery.  Subsequent review conferences have reaffirmed that the general purpose criterion encompasses all future scientific and technological developments relevant to the convention.  Biological agents and toxins themselves are not prohibited; only their purpose is.Article II requires each state party, no later than nine months after entry into force of the convention, to destroy or divert to peaceful purposes all agents, toxins, weapons, equipment and means of delivery prohibited by Article I.  Article III prohibits states parties from transferring or otherwise encouraging other states or organisations to acquire any of the agents, toxins, weapons, equipment or means of delivery prohibited by Article I.  Article IV requires states parties to take any necessary national measures to prohibit and prevent the misuse of biological agents, toxins, weapons, equipment and means of delivery within their territories.  This will require states parties to adopt or adapt policies and domestic laws where necessary.United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540  is a measure adopted by the Security Council under chapter VII of the UN charter to maintain or restore international peace and security and is binding on all member states of the UN.  The resolution affirms that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security.  Its purpose is to supplement the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions and its focus is, in particular, the risk posed by non-state actors, including terrorists, of acquiring and using nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, their means of delivery and related materials.  To assist the Security Council in monitoring implementation of the resolution, the council established the 1540 committee.  The 1540 committee, to which states are required to make regular reports on implementation, maintains regular contact and dialogue with all UN member states, including Ireland.  The resolution sets out a number of distinct areas in which states are required to take action to prohibit and prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.  In particular, states are required to adopt what is termed "appropriate effective laws that prohibit any non-state actor to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use" this range of weaponry.To better co-ordinate implementation of all relevant international obligations by Departments and State agencies in Ireland, the Government established the interdepartmental committee on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in January 2010.  The committee is responsible for co-ordinating implementation of the State's obligations arising under international conventions, UNSCR, European Union law and various policy frameworks.  These obligations include those arising under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  The interdepartmental committee also addresses other issues in the non-proliferation area, as necessary.  It is chaired by a senior officer in my Department and, in the case of matters relating to export control regimes falling under its remit, by an official of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The Departments of Defence, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, and Justice and Law Reform, as well as the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána, Revenue Commissioners, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and various other agencies are also involved.Ireland ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1972.  At that time, the view was taken that the obligations assumed by the State under the convention, in particular the obligation under Article IV "to take any necessary measures to prohibit and prevent the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition, or retention" of weapons was adequately provided for under existing domestic law, principally the Firearms Acts.  However, following a review of the law carried out in the context of Ireland's participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative and, subsequently, the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1540, it has been decided to create specific biological weapons offences.  This will remove any doubt regarding the feasibility of future prosecutions of persons for activities involving biological weapons.  There is extensive provision in law relating to chemical weapons and nuclear materials, in particular the 1997 Chemical Weapons Act, the Radiological Protection Acts and the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Act 2003.Biological agents occur widely in the natural environment.   Many of them are harmless but others have the potential to cause ill-health.  There are also workplaces, such as laboratories, where work involving biological agents is carried on intentionally and for perfectly legitimate purposes.A considerable body of law sets out the minimum requirements for the protection of workers from the health risks associated with biological agents in the workplace.  This is to be found in EU bio-safety law, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations 1994, as amended.The Bill before the House will not affect in any way legitimate activities involving the intentional or coincidental production or use of biological agents.  On the contrary, the Bill will apply only to activities whose purposes are hostile.  It will expressly prohibit, among other acts, the production, acquisition, possession, development, transport, transfer or use of biological weapons as required by the terms of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on Poisonous Gases, the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Resolution 1540.Section 1 of the Bill defines a number of key terms in the Bill, in particular the terms "hostile purpose" and "prohibited weapon".  Section 2 makes it an offence to develop, produce or use a biological agent or toxin for a hostile purpose, or to stockpile, acquire, possess, retain — Deputy Higgins will be interested in this — or transfer to another purpose a biological agent or toxin for a hostile purpose.  It also makes it an offence to develop, produce, use, stockpile, acquire, possess, retain or transfer to another purpose a prohibited weapon.  It will also be an offence to attempt to do any of these things.  In other words, it would be an offence to attempt to transfer such a weapon through our national territory.Section 3 creates offences of prohibited acts when committed outside the State in specific circumstances, when committed on ships and aircraft registered in Ireland, or by members of the Defence Forces, citizens of Ireland or an Irish body corporate.Section 4 sets out the penalties to which a person guilty of an offence under sections 2 or 3 will be liable.  The maximum penalty, on summary conviction, will be imprisonment for 12 months and a fine of €5,000, or both.  For conviction on indictment, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, a fine or both, a potentially very severe penalty that reflects the seriousness of the offence.Section 5 is a standard provision dealing with evidence of an accused person's Irish citizenship.  Section 6 is also a standard provision that prevents a person being prosecuted in Ireland in respect of an offence for which they have already been tried in another country.Sections 7 and 8 provide that where a person develops, produces, uses, stockpiles, acquires, possesses, retains or transfers to another person a microbial or other biological agent, or toxin, in prescribed circumstances, there is a presumption that he or she has intended to do so for a purpose prohibited by the convention unless there is a reasonable doubt.  Section 9 is a standard provision to ensure that bodies corporate do not avoid responsibility for conduct prohibited to individuals.Section 10 provides that anything seized and retained in relation to a conviction under the Act may be forfeited to the State and shall be disposed of as the Minister may direct.  This provision is necessary to ensure that material seized during the investigation of a suspected offence is not returned to a claimant under the Police (Property) Act 1897 but is sent for destruction.  Section 11 sets out the procedure for forfeiture of any biological agent or toxin regardless of whether a conviction has been secured in a given case.  Section 12 provides for forfeiture of related fixtures, such as buildings used for the purposes of producing a biological weapon.Ireland has been, for many years, a leading advocate for greater international co-operation in the fields of disarmament and arms control.  In my view, there are more than sufficient ways of causing harm to a human being than people investing their time, energy and ingenuity in the development of newer, more deadly weaponry.  Ireland has played a leading role in particular in efforts to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and, most recently, in efforts to prohibit cluster munitions.  It is important, therefore, that where we develop international commitments in these areas we also ensure that proper provision is made for them, where necessary, in our own domestic law.  When possible gaps are identified, such as in the current case, it is just as important that we move to fill them.  For this reason I commend this Bill to the House and I look forward to the contributions from Deputies.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	208	One of the main foreign policy commitments of the Fine Gael Party is to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament.  For that reason, this legislation is entirely in keeping with this policy and commitment and Fine Gael will be supporting the Bill to ensure its passage without delay.In the past 20 years there has been a fundamental change in relationships in Europe and the world.  The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact have changed completely the context of Ireland's neutrality.  In today's world, many of the threats faced by societies and states are not from each other but from armed groups and fundamentalist militants seeking to destroy the properties and lives of citizens.  In light of these threats, it is important, therefore, for Ireland not to stand still by applying a 20th century form of neutrality to a 21st century world with 21st century problems.  We must be to the forefront in the design of a common EU security and defence system in order to face new threats to world peace and international law.  Our neutrality needs to evolve to take into account these changes.  Fine Gael believes it would be a tragic mistake for Ireland not to seek to influence the European security system in the future.  We should not only be part of the European security and defence architecture but we should be one of the architects helping to design these systems to meet our needs and our view of Europe's needs.Fine Gael wants any common security and defence system to be guided by our five main principles: to adhere to the fundamental principles of the United Nations; the pursuit of universal nuclear and biological disarmament; and the commitment to providing peacekeeping and peace-making operations.  Ireland can be very proud in this regard and should always ensure it partakes in peacekeeping missions and peace-making operations.  In recent years, with the exception of Chad, our Defence Forces missions abroad have decreased and this is regrettable.  We should avail of every opportunity to ensure the Defence Forces are available for missions of peacekeeping or peace-making.  I hope this Government will pursue every opportunity in that regard.I commend the ongoing work of the Defence Forces Military College at the Curragh.  This is regarded as a college of excellence for teaching peacekeeping methods which have been evolved over many foreign operations.When I was Minister for Defence, I was visited by the United States military attaché.  He asked my permission to recommend to his superiors that some of their key personnel be sent to the Curragh college to learn peacekeeping methods.  He openly admitted to me that they knew nothing about peacekeeping.  They had the most modern weapons in the world and they trained their forces in the use of these weapons but when it came to peacekeeping, they knew nothing.  I thought this was a very open admission on the part of a senior military person.  I invited him to participate in any activities in the Curragh college.  This illustrates that a small country such as Ireland can influence so much in the world, especially in the area of foreign policy.  We do not have any baggage and we are respected.  It is important that we never lose the talent we have for peacekeeping.The fourth principle is to respect the right of other EU states to enter other military alliances or to remain neutral, as they choose.  The fifth principle is the right of Ireland to opt in and out of aspects of a mutual defence and security system on a case-by-case basis.  In order to ensure these five principles enshrined in a European security and defence policy, we must be prepared at all times to engage fully in any discussions leading up to the adoption of any such policy.Regarding the legislation before us, my information is not quite in accordance with the statement of the Minister of State.  I understood there were 159 state parties and 15 signatory states to the biological weapons convention but I bow to the knowledge of the Department of Foreign Affairs in that regard.  I note that the convention was opened for signature in 1972 and came into force in 1975.It was the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning an entire category of weapons.  It effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, retention, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons.  Although it had a turbulent operational history, the convention is commonly hailed for establishing a fundamental international law norm that the hostile use of disease is repugnant to mankind.  I fully support this.While establishing a broad norm of international repugnance for biological warfare, securing agreement on how to monitor and enforce compliance with the convention's articles has proven difficult.  The biological weapons convention state parties have the right to request a formal investigation through the UN Security Council if they believe another state has violated the convention.  However, to date no state party has ever used this vehicle to lodge a complaint.  The reluctance to use the Security Council mechanism has often been ascribed to the highly political nature of an accusation made in the UN.  This is a sad reflection on the UN Security Council.  There are five permanent members and in today's world, it strikes me that the provision is out of date.  There is a lack of trust and some decisions taken at Security Council level are guided by political influences of a particular member state.The UN Security Council is vital in the architecture of peace maintenance and world order.  As with this House, it should look at itself and consider re-organising.  The UN is an important body and is the only building in which various nations, which may be at loggerheads with each other on various issues, assemble and we should let nothing damage the principle of the institution.  Sometimes one must examine how it does its business.  It has suffered over the past number of years, perhaps because of the failure to fund it properly.  Accusations of wasting public moneys and other issues have damaged its reputation for administration functions.  That is not to say that the principle should not be protected.  As a small country within the EU, Ireland should use its influence to open a discussion and debate within the EU on whether it is time for the EU to make proposals on the reform of the UN.  A body such as the EU should have a place on the Security Council structure in a reformed system.Perhaps the Security Council is expected to deal with too many matters.  One of the most important issues today is the world response to national tragedies.  The most recent was that of Pakistan.  Our ability to organise ourselves to come to the rescue of states that suffer these tragedy, such as Haiti and Pakistan, leaves a lot to be desired.  Our failure to involve ourselves quickly on a humanitarian basis only benefits the likes of the Taliban and fundamentalist groups.  It gives them an opportunity to promote their wares.  It is vital importance that we are willing and able to come to the aid of nations struggling with a major tragedy.  It is vitally important we look at our procedures to see how we can reform matters.The biological weapons convention has accrued a certain degree of notoriety for the regularity with which it was breached and the weak alternative arbitration matters incorporated in the convention.  We should be aware of that.  Perhaps the Minister of State can guide me in his response.  I am not aware of how one goes about changing a convention.  Perhaps it requires a new convention to replace the existing convention.  Some 30 years have passed since this convention was established and, as with everything else, time moves on.  Provision is made for a review every five years.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	210	We should avail of the five-year reviews to examine how the convention is working in new circumstances, how it can be improved and how we can attract new states to signing up to the principles of the convention.  A group has been established within the Department, involving other State agencies and Departments, to examine these conventions.  I welcome that participation.  It is important that this structure produces proposals so that the political systems and Ministers can propose amendments to existing conventions or propose new conventions.  I am highlighting the benefit of Ireland, as a small country in the EU that has proven its ability to punch above its weight and that is listened to, using its influence and membership to propose ideas to improve matters.  Thankfully, we do not have a vested interest in this area.While the Bill has extra-territorial application to citizens, members of the Defence Forces and Irish registered aeroplanes and ships, it expressly precludes the transportation of biological warfare materials through Irish airspace.  The weakness of this Bill is that it does not amount to a ban on transshipment or provide greater search and prosecution powers to those who may suspect biological weapons are being moved through Irish airspace or ports.  This is a weakness I intend to raise on Committee Stage.  I hope that something can be done about this through this debate.  We often ignore the fact that our air space can be used for things with which we as a country do not agree.  Therefore, we should make certain that we do not allow others to use it in such a way.  I look forward to discussing that point further on Committee Stage to see whether there is anything we can do in that regard.This is the type of legislation on which one could speak for a long time.  Many of the points I wish to make, over and above what I have said, have been outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.  I do not intend to delay the House by repeating what he has said.Membership of the European Union is important.  Thank goodness the modern generation in this country is moving on and that we are now in a position where we can think outside the box.  As I said at the outset we should concentrate on how we can play a major role within the European Union in terms of foreign policy, security and defence and especially in the area of peacekeeping and peacemaking.  We should avail of any opportunity through our membership of the European Union to improve on this or other conventions.I thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation.  I look forward to perhaps trying to improve it, if that is possible.  On the question of transshipment I raised earlier, I look forward to seeing if a provision on this can be included in the Bill on Committee Stage.

Tá clú mhuintir na hÉireann agus Rialtas na hÉireann ag feabhsú toisc go bhfuil reachtaíocht den leithéid seo á thabhairt isteach againn. I very much welcome the legislation.  The Labour Party sees it as part of an ethical foreign policy and for that reason we support it, as we did taking a strong position on cluster munitions and, prior to that, landmines legislation.  I am grateful for the Minister of State's detailed speech.  I wish to make a number of points which I hope will be of assistance.  As the previous speaker said, there are points to which we may return on Committee Stage.The first thing that is important is the status of the convention itself.  The Minister of State in his speech placed the Bill alongside other legislation which seeks to vindicate the ban on cluster munitions and the ban on landmines.  It is not pedantic to say that the introduction to the Minister of State's speech suggests that this legislation will give further effect to the 1972 convention.  With respect — I will not go into it now — I suggest that this is a flourish because I am not aware of previous legislation that addressed the 1972 convention except indirectly.  It has not been addressed by way of direct legislative reference.  That is a very minor point in the context of welcoming the Bill.  It is a point to which I will return.One of the difficulties for the public understanding of the Bill is that people are rightly proud of this country's role in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  It was a very fine moment in Irish diplomacy and activity and it is rightly recorded as such.  However, one of the difficulties about the convention, which also arises in terms of the biological weapons convention, is the atmosphere of bad faith among some of the signatory nations.  The problem arose with the nuclear ban, for example, that the signatories under major sections of the treaty were required to destroy nuclear weapons but they did not do so.  They also happened to be permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.  One was left, in the most troublesome days of the reviews that took place every five years of the non-proliferation treaty, with the fact that the treaty was now concerned with proliferation only and not with the elimination of nuclear weapons.  It is equally the case in regard to the biological weapons convention that some of the signatories are in possession of biological weapons but they are not destroying them.  Therefore, the concentration in the previous reviews of the biological weapons convention has once again retreated to proliferation and non-proliferation.That is a significant point for the public to understand, that international law is weakened when in fact the most powerful and also the most permanent members of the Security Council do not feel bound by the full text of the convention in terms of getting rid of those kind of weapons, but that the convention is for lesser and newer players.  I make this fundamental point because when I make proposals to the Labour Party on foreign policy I have placed the emphasis on it being an ethical foreign policy.  I have a real problem with the diplomatic interpretation of obligation.  That is a point to which I will return.Another issue that arises is that not only have some countries been in possession of those weapons but they have used them.  Again, that has become a matter of contention in regard to detail.  I accept the reports that indicate a considerable volume of weapons being held by Russia, for example, a signatory nation, that might have been used in Chechnya.  I am sure they were used in Fallujah in the last Iraq war.  That raised a significant issue to which I will return in the context of the Bill, namely, whether the possession of biological weapons will be an offence under the legislation.  I would like clarification on the issue.This also arises in regard to another matter that is very important on transmission.  Is the possession of the weapons themselves now an offence because one could qualify that by saying the possession of biological weapons for a hostile purpose is the offence?  Again, one might also say that if one is trying to establish the facts on why a biological weapon is in the possession of a person does one have the right to seize it.  Having seized it, does the person apprehended have to establish possession of it for a non-hostile purpose?  All of those issues remain for clarification in the text of the Bill.I welcome the extra-territorial reach of the Bill, which is very good.  On the question of compliance, the Minister of State correctly outlined how the Bill fits in with other legislation.  Later in the Minister of State's speech, he mentioned the existence of an interdepartmental committee.  It would be valuable when he is replying on the legislation if he gave some details of the national compliance mechanism.  I cannot see the detail of that in the legislation or in his speech, although I may have missed it.  Will the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation have responsibility for chemical matters, while the National Radiological Protection Agency will be responsible for nuclear matters?  This is an issue that can be clarified as we move on, I prefer to concentrate on the broad features of the Bill on Second Stage.The use of Irish airspace is interesting.  In February 2010, on the Order of Business one day I asked about the Air Navigation Acts 1978 and 1988.  In response to my Bill, which would have changed the provisions for the transmission of materials through Irish airspace and would have allowed for the boarding of aircraft if there were suspicions, the Government stated that it would prepare its own legislation and that it had appointed a subcommittee of the Cabinet to that end.  When I last investigated this, I found its last meeting was in 2009.  As Deputy Barrett said, we should mention transmission through Irish airspace, but this Bill falls short of including new rights of surveillance and establishing of fact.We were brought all round the bushes about Shannon Airport being used at the time of the Iraq war.  The onus was placed on the civilian to establish that there was something offensive on board an aircraft.  I met two senior gardaí who suggested the legislation involved was that covering defence of the right of entry to one's home.  We left that aside and I then went back to the Air Navigations Acts 1978 and 1988 but there was no capacity to establish a matter of public concern.  This also arose during the Council of Europe investigation and the investigation by the subcommittee of the European Parliament.  We completed a questionnaire that we sent back to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in which we referred to the legal capacities of our legislation but we omitted to say that we had decided not to use them.  Even if we had, would they have been sufficient?  This should have been an opportunity to address the issue of air transport and the right of surveillance.The Minister of State may be tempted to reply but I urge him to resist the temptation and look at the text of the Bill.  It goes a certain way, referring to the offence of possession and to transmission.  It also has extra-territorial application to citizens, members of the Defence Forces and to Irish registered planes and ships, and expressly prohibits the transportation of biological warfare materials through Irish airspace.  It makes the possession of a biological weapon or agent a criminal offence, although I have raised issues of interpretation of that related to intention, which we might tease out on Committee Stage.The Bill makes the possession of a biological weapon or agent a criminal offence, which could implicate individuals of whatever nationality who are in possession of biological weapons on planes parked on an Irish apron.  That is stronger than section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act but it does not amount to a stronger ban on transshipment or provide greater search and prosecutorial powers to those who may suspect that biological weapons are being moved through Irish airspace or ports.  Put simply, civilians are still as impotent in this as they were before and when the issue arose of the appalling extra-legal abuse of international law that was the Iraq war.The way out of this would have been to include an agreed passage that came out of the Cabinet subcommittee on the Air Navigation Acts 1978 and 1988.  I am not drafting the legislation; perhaps there is other legislation that could be amended.I turn to the international atmosphere in which this convention is being discussed.  We must make our gains in an atmosphere of bad faith and the abuse of position by some of the major power holders, particularly at Security Council level.  We should not regard this as anything other than abuse of international law and influence within diplomacy.  I had the greatest sympathy for those Irish personnel who have been going to the review committees on the convention.  I must restrain myself from getting sidetracked into the serious weaknesses in the non-proliferation treaty and the US-India agreement on nuclear weapons.  It completely discredited the powerful work by the New Agenda Group.  Ireland had to undertake a diplomatic flurry to justify its being the second last country standing before it was forced to capitulate.Since 1991, the verification procedures for the biological weapons convention have included the use a panel of experts.  This mechanism of verification is not very satisfactory.  Fallujah is an example of the abuse of chemical weapons.  The law was confused when people claimed such weapons could be used if they were necessary part of a retreat from a conflict area.  Another argument was made that if care had been taken to remove civilians from an area, anyone who remained was a combatant. There was also the question of particular flares being used for destruction instead of for the clarification of a conflict zone.  At the end of the day, the thing that mattered was the damage done to people.  Where biological weapons are concerned, a number of important medical bodies, including an authoritative group from Canada, have investigated the effects on children in southern Iraq of weapons that might have been used as biological weapons.Deputy Barrett referred to an interesting matter, namely, that the mechanism through which countries may make a formal complaint has not been used.  It does not serve the Security Council's mechanisms well if major countries produce lists of allegations against countries they believe are in breach, yet do not follow up with formal complaints.  The Minister of State might help me if he has been advised, since I suspect a trade off is involved.  A permanent member of the Security Council that publishes a list from its domestic department will not make a formal complaint in the full knowledge that another permanent member will take the exact same road.  In turn, this trade off undermines the compliance mechanisms at international level.Another matter arises in this respect, namely, the interesting question of how compliance is managed internationally.  The Minister of State might address it.  He stated, "The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention prohibits the use, production, development, stockpiling and transfer of biological weapons, extensively supplementing the 1925 protocol in so far as it applies to biological weapons."  He also stated, "The Biological Weapons Bill will create specific offences relating to the use, production and possession of biological weapons."  How will the compliance mechanism work at home and internationally?The Minister of State referred to something about which I am unsure.  He stated:Today, no state acknowledges that it possesses biological weapons or that it has a programme to develop such weapons.  The stigma attached to the use of such weapons and their prohibition under the convention have been strong deterrents.  This has not, however, completely allayed concerns with regard to bio-weapon development by states.  For instance, it was alleged in the early 1990s, by Soviet defectors, that the former Soviet Union had conducted a vast, clandestine biological weapons programme.  Iraq, also a party to the convention, was found in 1995 to have had a considerable undeclared biological warfare programme.I hope the Minister of State does not take what I say personally, but this is a selective set of quotations.  One needs to take care when ascribing substance to the question of the allegations of Soviet defectors in the early 1990s.  I am familiar with the case.  The question of Iraq relates to the question of inspections and so on.  What was far more dangerous was the destruction of parliamentary credibility by those who made false allegations, not only about biological weapons, but about weapons of mass destruction in general.I wish to make an interesting comment lest I forget.  I was invited to visit the head office of one of the major embassies on Mespil Road with a number of other Deputies, including the late Tony Gregory.  We were shown a file produced in London that contained what were supposed to be aerial photographs of weapons of mass destruction on the move in Iraq.  One looked like a photograph of an articulated truck but was described to all of us present as being a chemical laboratory on the move.  To my horror I saw the same file in the hands of Colin Powell at the United Nations Security Council.  He read out that rubbish.While I welcome this legislation, if we are to have respect at home and internationally for wonderful conventions that seek to preserve humanity, the fact that such investigation and compliance mechanisms could be degraded so comprehensively by the abuse of alleged intelligence sources in parliament by a prime minister, as unfortunately occurred in the UK's case with tragic consequences for individuals and the parliamentary process, does not help the law, politics or the peaceful thrust of the conventions that have their origins in the UN.  It is the best prospect we have of being a forum to advance peace.The Minister of State referred to a matter I have addressed when he stated, "The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a hybrid instrument of international humanitarian law and disarmament and non-proliferation".  When he replies, he might say whether this is an opportunity to examine how we might be innovative in terms of implementation and compliance mechanisms, taking into the account the successes and setbacks experienced in the other parts of the hybrid.The question of whether review conferences are to rely on the verification mechanisms to which I referred is interesting.  The Minister of State might have anticipated another point following the production of my Private Members' Bill some time ago.  Working as I was with the limited resources available to me, I concentrated on the right of citizens to answer a concern.  I was not referring to putting together a maverick group, as it was described, that could ask to go aboard every aeroplane that landed.  Rather, this would have occurred only where a concern had been well established internationally.  In the case of Shannon Airport, we had in mind flight plans and other matters that were of concern to the most responsible groups in different countries.  However, we found ourselves obstructed in every way.  A greater impetus might have been given to national legislation after the last review conference in 2006.  I am not familiar with the debate which took place then but I understand that at that conference national governments were urged to bring forward national legislation of compliance.

This was an interesting measure and I point out with some humility to the Minister of State and his officials that this resolution was brought in as a Chapter 7 resolution under the United Nations Charter.  What is attempted in some of the text of the resolution does not necessarily benefit from the context in which Chapter 7 was invoked.  I state this very seriously.  I welcome the linking of the biological weapons convention to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the general intention but it is rather sad that Resolution 15/40 of 2004 was itself so abused as to provide a cover for actions that were neither in compliance with the United Nations Charter nor with any fundamental principles of international law.On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this Bill to which we will be very happy to propose amendments on Committee State.  I also pay tribute to the Minister of State and his staff for adding this Bill to the Cluster Munitions Bill and others.  Without doubt, these are very significant enhancements of Ireland's reputation abroad.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill to which I wish to take a different view, namely, one that relates more to its scientific and biological aspects.  Deputy Higgins covered many of the international legislative aspects which are clearly the basis on which the Bill is predicated.This is an area for which it is difficult to legislate because of the very nature of the biological agents involved.  While many of the agents we know are positive, productive and useful, depending on the environment and the way in which they are produced, their potential for harm is enormous.  Many of the biological agents, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how they are used and applied, have the capacity for mutation.  This is particularly the case for bacteria and viruses and is something over which we many have little control scientifically because natural mutations may occur to allow the agent to evolve into something significantly more toxic or dangerous than we had anticipated.  Against that background, those kinds of agents are clearly much more difficult to legislate for and to predict what might happen in their regard.It is also true that, on a relative scale, looking at the agents from the point of view of warfare, they are cheap to develop and easy to hide.  However, it is not always easy to deliver the agent; there can be difficulties.  Their production is simple.  A very modest laboratory and a small amount of equipment and, in many cases, relatively little expertise in many areas can allow for the production of these agents.  These are the kinds of issues that make it difficult to deal with them.As the Minister of State, Deputy Roche stated, there is potential for good, too, in biological agents of this kind and it is against that background I wish to speak.  All of us would acknowledge that without the development of good scientific research over many years good vaccines would not be available to us.  In the production of such vaccines, however, organisms are developed that have the potential to be misused, abused and used very destructively.  I offer the example of the botulinum toxin which was mentioned by the Minister of State.  People will be very familiar with it.  Potentially, it is hugely damaging and very small amounts of it are extremely toxic.  However, minute amounts are used also as botox.  I do not know whether that is quite the balance I would like to make in that argument but some people might be interested to remember it has potential positive uses.My reason for speaking on this Bill relates to scientific development and research.  This is always ongoing and will evolve all the time.  We have seen that in regard to illegal drugs and their detection, for example, where it is so difficult to stay one step ahead.  Very often we are one step behind those who have the capacity, supports and technology to develop such agents.  The same will always be true of biological agents that can be used negatively.  For that reason, we still need to ensure we have good scientific expertise that allows us to be able to detect, manage and control such agents.  I say that against a background of scientific research.  That aspect is very important.I fully accept the need for the protocols and procedures that should be in place to ensure there are no hazardous outcomes, with people deliberately mishandling or misappropriating such agents.  They can be targeted against humans, animals or crops and this has happened.  The Minister of State mentioned this and Deputy Higgins also pointed out that these agents can be used in a number of different ways with different outcomes.  One can decide to destroy a food source for a country, for example.  There is plenty of historical evidence for this.The entire area of bio-security must be borne in mind.  Such legislation is not specific to this document and there is European law concerning bio-security and bio-safety.  We must keep that in mind at all times.  Clearly, the greater the international co-operation the better are our chances of reaching agreements and on that basis this legislation is important.  On those grounds I welcome the Bill.

Cuirfidh sé leis an raon reachtaíochta atá againn sa Teach seo atá ag seasamh lenár ndualgais idirnáisiúnta maidir le huirlisí atá á gcoigilt go hidirnáisiúnta chun úsáid i gcogaí difriúla.  Cheana féin, tá an Dáil seo tar éis reachtaíocht a rith maidir le cluster munitions agus a leithéid.  Chuireamar fáilte roimhe sin ag an am agus cuirfidh an Bille seo leis sin.An chúis leis an mBille seo ná go gcinnteofar nach mbeidh armlón cogaíochta bitheolaíoch á chruthú, á fhorbairt, á dhíol nó fiú i seilbh duine ar bith ar an oileán seo.  Glacfaidh gach duine leis an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an reachtaíocht seo.  Tá rudaí, mar a dúirt Teachtaí romham, gur gá dúinn a dhéanamh go fóill in ainneoin an Bhille seo agus ba chóir go nglacfadh an tAire le roinnt de na moltaí atá luaite cheana ag an Teachta Michael D. Higgins go háirithe.  Seasaim leis an chuid is mó atá ráite aige agus is cóir don Aire éisteacht leis an méid a dúirt sé mar tá easpa sa Bhille fós.The aim of the Biological Weapons Bill is to prohibit the use, development, production, manufacture, possession, stockpiling, acquisition and retention or transfer of biological weapons and, as such, it is a welcome development.  It sets a standard that one hopes many countries around the world can reach.  That is where Ireland should be in the world, setting standards albeit standards that do not impact greatly on this country.  We are not producers of biological weapons and to my knowledge we have not used or sold them.  However, countries close to us have been involved in such production.Countries close to us that are regarded as friends of Ireland have been involved in this trade.  Therefore the ban we are introducing in this Bill is to be welcomed.  It is welcome as a statement to the world that Ireland is not willing to stand over  the continued production and sale of such weapons.That was the same intention when we dealt with the cluster munitions and a number of other Bills in  recent years.  Ireland should try to set the standard and bring other countries along with us, by virtue of our arguments to persuade other states to end production and destroy any stockpiling of such weapons that exist.  The creation and stockpiling of biological weapons was outlawed in 1972 under the biological weapons convention.  This was signed by 159 state parties and there were 15 signatory states involved.  Given Ireland's neutral stance we signed it in 1972, but clearly any attempts to ban the use of such abhorrent weapons, aimed as they are at civilians — or even military targets —  must be continuously supported.However, ever since the passing of that convention in 1972, states have continued to produce, research and stockpile such weapons.  We have all seen the consequences of a biological weapon that was produced in the 1940s.  God knows how much further ahead military scientists have now got in their development of the technology as regards biological weapons.  We saw the consequences of mustard gas being used against the Kurdish population in Iraq and the horrendous photographs of young children and adults all suffering from the effects of a gas produced by the so-called allies  in the Second World War.  This was then sold or given, for whatever purpose, to the Iraqi regime.  It was madness that such weapons were not destroyed at end of the Second World War and hopefully, that climate of militarism which slowed the world down in many senses during the Cold War era has ended, where two competing blocs spent a fortune in creating the most destructive possible weapons while people starved around the world.Hopefully we are moving towards a different climate in the world, but I have my doubts, given what has happened in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent times.  The development of  such technology occurs in secret and we have to live with the expressed statements of countries such as the United States, Russia, France, Germany and Britain to the effect that they are no longer involved in the production or even research involving such weapons.  Time will tell and hopefully we can take them at their word.  I am sceptical, however.Having said that, the effect of this Bill is to ensure that in the future Ireland, at the very least, can say we took steps to ensure we played no hand, act or part  in any of the activities relating to this and that we did our best to ensure that this trade and its related production did not happen, not just here in Ireland but beyond our shores.  One of the welcome parts of the Bill is that it provides for the ability to prosecute citizens who have been involved in any way with this abhorrent trade.One concern I have is that the Bill does not expressly prohibit the transfer of biological warfare materials through Irish airspace.  This point was highlighted by Deputy Higgins, and given our recent history and the enormous controversy as regards the Government allowing US war planes to refuel at Shannon en route to war theatres in Iraq and Afghanistan, I believe it is a missed opportunity if the legislation is not amended as appropriate, so that we might prevent Ireland being dragged into conflicts involving biological weapons in the future.  We should therefore change the legislation to prohibit biological weapons being transported through Irish airspace.This needs to be coupled with a beefed up inspections regime at Shannon Airport, or any Irish airport used by the US or any other state's military force.  Such an inspections regime must also cover suspicious transfers of goods from companies that may be highlighted by the UN or whatever and that may be involved in the production of such weapons.  As Deputy Higgins indicated, we had a debate with An Garda Síochána around Shannon Airport.  It was not satisfactory and the political policy was effectively not to interfere in case Shannon Airport ended up closing because of the enormous wealth that US troops and their planes mean for the airport.  It is a sad day when an airport is dependent on an evil trade in renditions.  The Minister at the time with whom we argued, in particular, was former Deputy Michael McDowell, and he was wrong.  The Garda, when suspicions arise, must act when supplied with information and not have to wait until the case is proven by a citizen.  That is what I and Deputy Higgins were asked to do, as well as many others who had formed suspicions.I did not have the power to board an aeroplane at Shannon Airport, inspect the cargo and then inform the Garda that I believed this or that was the product on board.  That was wrong then, it is wrong now and it means we need to ensure that when a suspicion is formed it is acted upon rather than when the proof is given.  That means a message is being sent out to every country to the effect that Irish airspace and Irish airports do not welcome this.  In the event of our having such suspicious we must insist on the right to investigate and prosecute accordingly under this legislation.Questions have not been answered in regard to extraordinary rendition and there are still many questions the Government needs to address in that regard.  We may never know the answers but we know that the Guantanamo detention centre to where many unfortunates were transported through Irish airspace is still open.  I do not believe that the Government has salved its conscience in regard to Guantanamo Bay.  Ireland needs to do a good deal more.  I welcome the fact, however, that we have taken some of the detainees who were in Guantanamo Bay and allowed them to resettle in Ireland because of the threatened dangers to them if they returned to their native countries.  We should set an example and take a few more, while calling on other countries to do likewise.  Ireland should be an example to the rest of the world and show we will not stand for this.  In particular, the United States needs to a good deal more and quickly.The Bill makes the possession of biological weapons or agents a criminal offence, thus implicating any individual, whatever his or her nationality, who is in possession of such materials, for example on a an aeroplane parked at an Irish airport.Despite this welcome development, the Bill unfortunately does not provide greater search and prosecution powers to those who may suspect that biological weapons are being moved through Irish airspace.  Given the reluctance of the Irish authorities to search US planes in the past, I do not know how useful this provision will be if we do not have the courage to act on it.One of the welcome provisions of this Bill is that relating to dual-use materials.  This is crucial in that it criminalises not only those who use materials in their weaponised form but also those who seek to develop and produce materials in laboratories with hostile purpose.  This applies particularly to dual-use materials which may have a civilian purpose as well as a hostile purpose.  I am not sure whether the civilian use of Botox is beneficial — the jury is out on that, but we will know in the future.  Any development that seeks to criminalise those who use their scientific knowledge for such hostile purposes under the false cover of a civilian purpose is welcome.Another issue with the Bill is the legal test for ascertaining whether agents or toxins are being developed, produced or used for a hostile purpose.  The effect of sections 7 and 8 is to create a presumption that materials are for a hostile purpose and to place the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the prosecution.  This approach is interesting but there is a danger associated with it.  I ask the Minister to elaborate further on this on Committee Stage.  The Bills Digest mentions a case in the UK, R. v. Kebilene, in whose judgment it was stated: “[I]n the context of a serious offence such as terrorism, a reverse burden of proof provision on a matter central to the wrongdoing alleged against the defendant would breach article 6.2 of the European Convention of Human Rights”.  In view of the fact that the European Convention on Human Rights is now on a statutory footing in Ireland following the passage of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, this should be given further consideration so that the Bill does not fall foul of it in the future, because it is a welcome Bill.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I welcome the fact that there is all-party agreement in this area and I realise that the contributions were made in the spirit of improving the Bill.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that even though Ireland is a small country — although, as Deputy Barrett said, we often punch above our weight — and even though issues may not arise in terms of what goes on within our nation, we do have some responsibility to show the way.  I welcome the contributions that recognised this.I am grateful to Deputy Barrett for the positive way in which he kicked off.  He is correct in stating that neutrality confers obligations on us.  We cannot stand idly by and allow bestial and horrific things to happen elsewhere without somehow being morally responsible for them.  We may not be instrumental in the horrors but we have a responsibility to call a halt.  The Deputy was also right in stating that domestic legislation should reflect those moral obligations we assume.The Deputy also queried the number of signatories to the document.  I understand that since the document read by the Deputy was prepared, there have been four additional signatories, which explains the difference.The Deputy raised an interesting point about the structure of the United Nations.  I am one of the few people to stand in this Chamber as an elected representative who worked for a period in the UN, and I agree that it is a far from perfect organisation.  There are issues in the UN which undermine and diminish — and may possibly destroy — the institution.  That said, it is the best we have, and we should look forward to improving it.  The current and previous Secretaries General have spoken about reform, and we should assist them in that.There is an old saying that in international diplomacy there are interests rather than principles.  Certainly, as far as the UN is concerned, there are occasions when crude, narrowly focused, political national interests trump the principles on which the organisation is built.  It is an imperfect body, but for all we can detract from it, we should instead assist and build on it.  That is Deputy Barrett's view and it is mine too.Deputies Barrett and Higgins both mentioned the slow pace at which the UN moves.  This point was made specifically by Deputy Higgins about negotiations on the verification and compliance protocol.  They have taken an extraordinarily long time and collapsed in 2001 after the US Administration withdrew its support.  This is a classic example of the point made by Deputy Barrett that the crudest, narrowest political interests of a nation can determine points of principle.  This had more to do with the US elections at the time than anything else.  Recent efforts to improve compliance have included the establishment of the implementation support unit, based in Geneva, which I mentioned, and a number of other confidence-building measures.However, the only way to make the UN truly effective in this area is for those countries that are outside the main discussion — one of the great advantages we have is that we are slightly outside on some of these big issues — to point the finger and argue for progress.  Since its entry into force in 1975, states parties to the BTWC have striven to implement the convention, and this is something we should look to in the future.Deputies Barrett, Higgins and Ó Snodaigh mentioned the issue of transport of biological weapons through Ireland.  There is domestic legislation, the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, which prohibits foreign military aircraft from flying over or landing in Ireland except by express permission.  I realise this is an imperfect instrument, but it is an item of domestic legislation.  By way of clarification, it will be an offence within the terms of this legislation to have a biological weapon anywhere in the State, including an airport or a harbour.  This provides an answer to the query raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Deputies mentioned inspection; vigilance and surveillance are always issues.A number of contributors made reference to extra-territorial jurisdiction.  This important aspect of the legislation extends the criminal jurisdiction of the State to acts committed outside the State regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator.  This is only possible in rare cases such as war crimes.  My advice is that it is a matter of legal policy.  Ireland has only a limited basis for extra-territorial jurisdiction, but the fact that it is referenced here is important.When Deputy Upton was talking I was struck by the thought that Members of the House are frequently regarded as jacks of all trades and masters of none.  I am sorry the Deputy has had to leave because I had intended to pay tribute to the scientific focus she has brought to the House.  Her research-based outlook is valuable and she made an interesting contribution.  She recognised that there is a difficulty — also mentioned by Deputy Ó Snodaigh — with materials and processes that are used for positive scientific research but that have the potential to be used for negative purposes.  She mentioned, in particular, the specific difficulties that arise from the capacity or otherwise of potentially harmless agents to be scaled up to a dangerous level.  The Bill makes it clear that a biological weapon is a weaponized biological agent so it does speak to intent, which is the query that Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised.  The Bill defines a "prohibited weapon" and the possession of a prohibited weapon as an offence — therefore, weaponising is the issue.  Sections 7 and 8 make it clear that the development or manufacture of an otherwise harmless or benign agent to the point of it being a weapon is the issue.Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the horror of the Fallujah incident and Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned the extraordinary madness that informed the giving of either mustard gas or the agents for its creation to the Iraqi regime.  The Fallujah incident did concern the use of phosphorus, which is a chemical element in incendiary weapons.  Nonetheless I happen to share the view that it was supposedly used to illuminate a battlefield.  It is very hard for any human being to stand up with a straight face and say that putting such a weapon into a school illuminated a battlefield.  I am very conscious of the contribution made by Mr. John Ging in this case and his bravery and courage.The Deputy also suggested that the compliance mechanism has been undermined.  I have mentioned this already.  It has been undermined and it has been undermined regularly in the United Nations by member states trading off.  The Deputy is right, I was a critic of the structure of the United Nations.  As Deputy Barrett said, surely when we walk into that building in New York, we are all equal, we are not children of a lesser God simply because we come from a nation that has 4 million people, rather than 44 million or 244 million.  Citizens live and die in the same way, irrespective of race, colour or creed.  Certainly the United Nations and the fact that there is a Security Council arrangement that gives special recognition to individual states is an historic anomaly and an issue that needs to be looked at.  Two contributions mentioned that there should be a special position for the European Union.  I am not sure there should be a special position for anybody.Having dealt with Deputy Upton's contribution, I pay a personal tribute to her.  She has brought a scientific rigour and interest in research in science into the House which is welcome.Deputy Ó Snodaigh made a very interesting contribution where he talked about us setting a standard.  It may not arise in a practical sense in an Irish context, that is, the manufacture or the weaponising of biological material.  The Bill is important in that it makes a statement.  I agree with him and the fact that other nations have a responsibility to act in this way is helpful.I agree very much with the Deputy's contribution, in particular, his reference to the horrors visited on the Kurds in Iraq and the moral responsibility that lies with those political friends of ours who made decisions to thus arm a repugnant regime.  There is a moral consequence to every action we take as politicians.  Certainly the people who made those decisions did not equip themselves very well.I will look at any views that come forward on Committee Stage.  I am grateful to the Deputies for their very positive contributions.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The reprehensible events at Anglo Irish Bank have caused enormous damage to our country.  There is a clear and overwhelming public interest that, where it is shown that anyone involved in those events broke the law, they should face justice.  Neither I nor the Government can seek to interfere, direct investigations or decide whether people should face charges.  That is a cornerstone of our democratic system.Given the grave issues at stake, it is right that I have sought to be kept fully briefed by the Garda Commissioner on the investigation.  I will tell the House what I can about it.  Of its nature, what I can say at this stage is limited.  It is imperative that neither I nor indeed any Member of this House say anything that would have the effect, however unintended, of helping people to evade justice.The investigation is a joint one, under the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  It is headed by an assistant commissioner and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has retained two senior counsel and one junior counsel to advise the investigators.  Some 27 gardaí and 16 officers of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are assigned to the investigation.This is the most complex investigation of its kind ever undertaken in the State.  There are ten strands to it.  It requires the analysis of a huge range of records — more than 100,000 documents, including e-mails and telephone and bank records.  More than 350 people have been interviewed, and inevitably in a case like this, their witness statements can be extremely lengthy.  Search warrants and court orders have been executed and persons arrested.  Inquiries are taking place outside the State.It is clear, therefore, that a huge amount of work has been undertaken.  Investigators must follow every avenue to which their inquiries lead, so it is not possible to be precise as to when their work will be completed.  I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda Síochána has no higher priority than completing this investigation.  For his part, the Commissioner meets regularly with his officers involved, ensuring that at all times they have every resource they require.I well understand the fury of people at what happened at the bank.  There is understandable indignation that no one has yet been brought before the courts.  It would, however, do a huge disservice to those people to pretend that there is some simple or quick way of dealing with this matter that will be effective.  What is important is that what happened is systematically and forensically investigated as quickly as possible, with a view to presenting cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is exactly what is happening without fear or favour.It is important too that we, as legislators, learn any lessons we can.  That is why I asked the Garda Commissioner to have a look at the law in this area in May, based on the experience of this and other cases, and to make any recommendations for change.  Company law and the law governing financial institutions are not primarily matters for me but my Department has been in contact with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on this.  Those Departments have contacted my Department about the preparation of the White Paper on Crime, with a view to devising proposals in the area of white collar crime.  We will publish a discussion paper on white collar crime in the not too distant future.  We are also open to any suggestions from Members opposite on changes in this area.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Does the Minister acknowledge there is widespread public anger and incredulity at the utter failure of the State, so far, to initiate criminal proceedings of any nature in respect of the Anglo Irish Bank fiasco?  Does the Minister agree the events in which Anglo Irish Bank was involved, including exotic share dealings and the transfer of funds intended to maintain share value on artificial levels and to conceal the insolvency of the bank, provide fertile ground for the taking of criminal prosecutions?  In the context of the investigation being conducted by the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, can the Minister tell the House if all former board members of Anglo Irish Bank and current and former employees have fully co-operated in the provision of all essential information and documentation?  Can the Minister clarify whether, in the course of the investigation, the possibility of criminal prosecution has been complicated or compromised by any suggestion that the former Financial Regulator, the former Governor of the Central Bank, officials in the Department of Finance or any Minister had prior knowledge of the peculiarities of the share dealings and financial structures in Anglo Irish Bank or sanctioned some of those that have given rise to the enormous problems with which the State is confronted?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The independent investigating authority — the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement — is to carry out this investigation without fear or favour.  To the best of my knowledge that is happening.  I can understand the fury and outrage of the public.  No one is more outraged than members of the Cabinet, who must deal with this issue on a daily basis since the crisis arose.  Unfortunately, outrage is no good on a book of evidence, as Deputy Shatter knows.  Outrage does not prove a criminal offence.  What does so is the forensic examination of the scale going on, with more than 100,000 documents, telephone records, bank records in electronic format and hard copy, and 350 people providing witness statements.  Many of those had legal advice before making statements.  In one instance, the statement is 150 pages long.  Deputy Shatter can see the enormity of this investigation.  The case of an individual is something to be determined by the investigating authorities, as is the matter of from whom they should take statements and demand co-operation.  If people are not co-operating, and I have no information on this, it would be an offence under the law.  Where there is an element of criminal law and corporate law, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Síochána are dealing with those issues and they have the best legal advice available to them as the investigation continues.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Does the Minister not understand that when someone who has not paid a fine of €250 ends up in Mountjoy prison, someone who drives a truck into the gates of Leinster House ends up before the courts within 24 hours and bankers responsible for bringing the State to its knees and costing taxpayers €50 billion have not been brought before the courts it genuinely gives rise to a sense of public outrage, utter confusion and undermines confidence in our legal system?  Can the Minister clarify that the information sought from the Garda Commissioner about our laws to deal with white collar crime and the self-serving announcement made by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, a few days ago that an internal group would examine the extent to which our laws are adequate in this area is an admission that, despite 13 years of Fianna Fáil in government, we do not have laws of sufficient rigour to ensure bankers responsible for the debacle and catastrophe with which we are confronted are brought before our court in the same manner as bankers are brought before the courts, prosecuted and convicted in the United States?  It is an example of the gross failure of successive Fianna Fáil Governments in this State.

Deputy Shatter would correctly criticise me if I were seen to interfere directly in this investigation.  I and the Government share the outrage and fury at what has gone on.  In our democratic society there is a system where, independent of Government and political influence, these cases are examined.  That is happening and it is the way it should be.

It may be taking a long time but Deputy Shatter made reference to a number of cases that were relatively simple.  In this case there are ten different strands of investigation.  More than 115,000 e-mails and documents have passed between various institutions and individuals and they have to be examined.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The increase in activities by the groups in question in recent months is obviously a matter of concern for the Government.  I know that all Members of the House will join me in condemning these groups without reserve.  We should be clear that these people are no more than criminals using violent means in pursuit of their own ends.  They have no support in the wider community for their criminal ends or their violent means.The Garda Commissioner has made it clear that although these paramilitaries continue to pose a threat, as is clearly evidenced by incidents in Northern Ireland in recent months and days and the rise in the threat level in Britain, the Garda is working continually to disrupt and to foil their plans and activities.  My advice from the Garda authorities is that although the numbers involved in these groups are relatively small, they have nonetheless increased their capabilities and activities in recent months.  The pattern of dissident acts in recent months has been to target members of the security forces in Northern Ireland, particularly with repeated attempts on the lives of Catholic PSNI officers.I can assure the House that the Garda continues to co-operate seamlessly with the PSNI in actively pursuing the dissidents.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that he regards an attack on the PSNI as an attack on the Garda Síochána, an attitude shared by the Government.  The Chief Constable of the PSNI has also referred to the excellent operational relationship between the two forces.  This close level of operational co-operation has been instrumental in recent months in preventing atrocities and saving lives, and it will continue to be an essential element in bringing those criminals to book.It is only right to record the fact that the security services in both jurisdictions have had significant successes in preventing atrocities.  Since the start of this year the Garda has arrested over 50 people believed to be members of these groups and 22 are at present before the courts.  Facing up to the dissident threat is a priority for the Garda Síochána and, in support of this aim, the Government has maintained a high level of resources for the force, particularly in terms of keeping to the approved numbers of operational personnel.  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that he has the resources he needs at his disposal in this regard.The Government remains committed to upholding the democratically expressed desire of the overwhelming majority of people on this island to build a future based on peace and to consign all paramilitary violence to the past.  I know that this commitment will be shared by all in this House.  We will continue, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to spare no effort to ensure that those thugs who seek to subvert the democratic will of the people will face the full rigours of the law.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I join with the Minister in deploring what happened on Monday night.  Do I take it from what he has said that the dissident groups have the capacity not just to create destruction and mayhem, but to injure and take human life?  We know from experience that is only a matter of time before human life will be put at risk, whatever their intention.One reads reports about training bases and camps in the Republic being used by those same groups.  Does the Minister know anything about the bomb on Monday night in terms of whether it was travelled across the Border?  It is the case that policing and general security along the Border has been eased.  In normal circumstances we would all welcome that, but is the Minister satisfied that in the context of the dissident groups providing a more substantial threat than might have been anticipated at the time that there is adequate Border security in operation?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The situation in particular on the northern side has eased in terms of the militarisation to which we were used in the past 30 years, but it is safe to say that there has not been an easing of the Garda focus on the side of the Border.  That is instanced by the fact that this year alone 50 people have been arrested and 22 people are before the courts.  Recently at my insistence the Garda Síochána, in conjunction with a number of other State agencies, commenced multi-agency checkpoints along the Border.  I was a great supporter of that particular initiative when I was Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  Recently the Garda Síochána instigated those in an effort to disrupt not just ordinary smuggling, but also the dissident groups.  I understand they have been another successful operational tool.Deputy Rabbitte inquired about the capability of dissident groups.  There is doubt that even though their numbers are still relatively small they have gained in capability and there is more sharing of information between some of the groups which did not happen heretofore.On the question of training camps in the Republic while one can never say that this does not happen, the Garda Síochána has been very successful in recent years in dealing with the so-called dissidents.  Much of the reason for this is that most people do not have the type of support that their predecessors in the provisional IRA had across this island.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Much as we would like it to be the case, it is not quite true to say that there is no support for these groupings.  I read about the research done by a Liverpool academic who presented it to Queens University Belfast recently which indicates that, regrettably, there appears to be more support among the Nationalist community for them than we would have thought.In terms of the identity and flags of convenience being used by these groups, do I understand that other than the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA as we have known them, the most deadly group at the moment is flying under the flag of Óglaigh na hÉireann which is essentially a collection of former Provo activists?  Is the Minister concerned that such information is correct?  Is there information relating to the threat in Britain from the same groups?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I have seen press reports on that particular research.  It is safe to say that it does refer to the support being small by any standard.  The author refers to small-scale support.  None of us is complacent in that regard.  It is not correct to equate it to the type of support the Provisional IRA had especially in the North during its campaign of 30 years because the majority of people North and South do not give logistical support to the so-called dissidents.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	243	For the record, I am not equating it.

The issue of the threat in Britain is not regarded as severe as that to the North of Ireland.  The threat in the North has been there for some time.  That is the considered view of the Garda Síochána and the PSNI Chief Constable.  Equally, I know from the Garda Commissioner who is in contact with the security services in Britain that he is satisfied with the raising of the level of the threat to Britain.  Our focus on this island should primarily be on this island.  What was the middle question asked by Deputy Rabbitte?

That is something the Garda Síochána is examining very closely.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I understand from the Garda Commissioner that, in the course of preparing a comprehensive investigation file into the criminal activities of an organised criminal group for consideration by the DPP,  a small but nonetheless important portion of the investigation file was brought under gardaí supervision to the premises in question.During the course of the gardaí visit to the premises, and while a designated member of staff was dealing with the printing request, members of the Garda Síochána became aware that this person communicated with a third party without the consent of the Garda Síochána.   The gardaí present on the premises took immediate action to eliminate any risk of further exposure of this portion of the Garda investigation file.The involvement of the designated member of staff with the third party in this matter is the subject of a continuing Garda investigation, and it would be inappropriate to comment further on this at this time.  While the Commissioner is satisfied that the members of the Garda Síochána concerned acted in good faith in this matter, he is taking all steps necessary to avoid any recurrence of such an incident, including the issuing of a Garda Headquarters directive instructing members on the appropriate measures to be taken in compiling investigation files.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Could the Minister confirm that the file was taken to a premises called Read's Print and Design on Nassau Street?  Could he clarify why the file was taken there?  Is he suggesting to the House it was deliberately taken there by a group of gardaí to have the file photocopied or was it simply absent mindedly left in the shop and subsequently the gardaí raided the shop to get it back?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I do not want to go into specific details of the premises because a criminal investigation is ongoing.  It is safe to say the gardaí involved in the preparation of the file for the DPP decided to bring it to an outside printing operation.  That was not done because of a lack of resources, the gardaí have a full printing and photocopying capability in the office, but a decision was made for operational reasons.  This will not happen again because the Garda Commissioner has issued a directive that all future printing of these files, except in exceptional circumstances where the Garda premises does not have the proper capability, will be carried out in-house.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Will the Minister confirm this event involved members of the Garda Organised Crime Unit, a unit that is supposed to investigate gangland crime?  Could he confirm the file was being prepared for furnishing to the Director of Public Prosecutions and that there is a public need to maintain confidentiality on such files?  Will he clarify how, in any circumstances, any garda could have regarded it as appropriate to bring the file to a public shop to have pages photocopied by staff in that shop?  Could the Minister finally agree that with the difficulties we have with gangland crime, and the extent of the collapse of law and order and the number of people shot on our streets, it is an extraordinary example of complete incompetence that this occurred?  What is the Minister doing to ensure this is not repeated?  Have the people involved been disciplined in any way?

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	252	It is more like the Keystone Cops, it is extraordinary.

I can say categorically that this will never happen again.  Those involved are now wiser.  It was not just a matter of photocopying because the Garda Síochána has such facilities, it was to present the file in a better format for presentation to the DPP.  This file was not left on the premises, it was under the custody of the gardaí who noticed a member of staff of the premises communicating with a third party and immediately the gardaí intervened and took back the file.  The Garda Commissioner has ensured by the directive he issued that this will not happen again.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	254	It is scandalous and it happened on the Minister's watch.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	255	This is a despicable type of crime.  The abduction and false imprisonment of a person's family or friends, in order to coerce them into assisting with a robbery, is a particularly abhorrent type of crime.  The trauma visited on the innocent victims involved by heartless criminals can be only imagined by the rest of us.  I know my contempt for those responsible will be shared by Members of the House and by the wider public.There are agreed response procedures in place for dealing with such incidents.  Regular meetings are held between the Garda Síochána and financial institutions to discuss bank security issues and in particular kidnap prevention and response protocols.  While the Garda Síochána does not as a matter of policy and for obvious security reasons disclose these, they typically include the establishment of crisis management teams and protocols designed primarily to ensure the safe return of those persons held captive when such an incident happens.  Thereafter securing the arrest and prosecution of those involved becomes the Garda priority.Clearly it is incumbent upon the banks and financial institutions to do everything possible to prevent these robberies.  That means the protocols must be followed and systems put in place to ensure that, for example, it is not possible for employees who have been placed under terrible duress to be in a position to access large amounts of cash.  I do not blame employees who are acting under such duress, their safety and that of their families and friends is paramount.  I do, however, want to reiterate that is the Garda priority too.  The safety of people can be best assured by involving the gardaí as quickly as possible when these incidents take place.  When the protocols are followed the gardaí are given a great advantage in their efforts to foil these crimes and arrest those responsible.  That has been proven to be the case.  It is only by rendering these robberies unsuccessful that we will stop them happening, and thereby protect innocent employees and their loved ones from being caught up in them in the future.The training given to employees of financial institutions is in the first instance a matter for the financial institutions and I have emphasised to them their responsibilities in this regard.  The gardaí will assist in this in whatever way they can.  I have made clear the importance I attach to ensuring that staff members are fully trained and given the best advice on matters of safety and security.  To this end, advice on personal security for staff members and on systems and processes for the conveyance, storage and dispersal of cash is provided by the Garda Síochána on an ongoing basis and is subject to regular review.  I should mention that I have held discussions with the IBOA, the representative organisation for staff in the financial services sector, to make sure their concerns are heard and taken on board.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I want to assure the House that the gardaí are totally focused in combating this form of criminality as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs.  New legislation has been put in place to provide for covert surveillance evidence to be used in court.  I have also introduced legislation which specifically targets the organised criminal gangs responsible for these reprehensible crimes.  While obviously I cannot go into detail about ongoing Garda investigations, I can assure the House that the gardaí have been taking action under the legislation and we will see the fruits of that as they build up cases against the organised crime gangs, including those involved in tiger kidnapping.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I agree with the Minister that this is a most despicable form of crime but I suggest to him that in circumstances in which the protocols were complied with by a bank and banking officials, it is equally despicable to implicitly blame the victims of the crime for any event that occurred.  Would the Minister acknowledge that in the recent tiger kidnapping in Clondalkin AIB, bank officials fully complied with the protocols, despite the Minister insinuating otherwise to the press?  Is the Minister concerned that the content of these protocols are now known to criminal gangs, that criminal gangs are monitoring the manner in which the protocols are being applied and that they are doing so is undermining their effectiveness?  Is he concerned about the context of that particular despicable event, where the gardaí took an undue amount of time after being notified to attend the bank where the event occurred?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I agree with the Deputy that these are despicable crimes but I do not agree that I in any way insinuated that people did not adhere to the protocols.  I have been assiduous in saying that, while the protocols are there, it is easy for us to talk about compliance with protocols.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	258	There was compliance in this case but the implication was that there was not.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	259	If we were in the situation any of these people were put in, God only knows how we would react.  It is proven that any time these protocols have been adhered to, the operation has ended successfully.  When they have not been complied with, for whatever reason, there has been an unsuccessful operation.The protocols are not used on their own in these instances.  I would not want the message to go from the Dáil that people are monitoring these protocols or that the Garda Síochána did not react quickly in any instance.  I have seen the system it has set up to provide a rapid response once it receives a call.  The difficulty is that the call is sometimes made after the bird has flown.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I will again ask whether the Minister is concerned that the detail of the protocols is known by criminal gangs?  Does he acknowledge that his suggestion of a kidnap tax immediately after the horrendous event in Clondalkin on the basis that we should start charging people for money coming out of holes in the wall was asinine and inappropriate?  It would have no impact of any description in reducing the number of these events or placing bank officials in better safety.  Will he confirm to the House that in no circumstances will the Government introduce a kidnap tax or encourage banks to levy additional charges on people withdrawing their own funds?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	261	At no stage did I suggest a kidnap tax or an increase in taxation.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It is disappointing that we in this country cannot have a rational discussion on a matter of life and death for bank officials.  I have met the Irish Bank Officials Association, IBOA, bank managements and the Garda Síochána.  They told me that one of the difficulties highlighted by these incidents is the preponderance of cash in our banks and society.  The more cash, the more opportunities for burglars and robbers.  It is axiomatic.  The less cash in the system, the fewer the opportunities for the robbers.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Thanks to the Government there is a great deal less cash around these days for most people.

Given that our society is on the other side of the scale in terms of its level of cash, we as a society must examine the issue.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The Minister proposed people should pay to access their money.

I was trying to make a genuine point in response to the suggestion that there might have been a better way to go about this.  Deputy Shatter stated that criminals were going from issue to issue.  The number of tiger kidnappings is significant, but that was not the case heretofore.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I will adjourn the House.  If the Minister and the Deputy decide to have a bilateral discussion, they can have it elsewhere because I will not have the House made a mockery of.  Both Members will have regard to the Chair or we will adjourn.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I am informed that the Garda Síochána is aware of reports which indicate continuing efforts by dissident groups and criminal networks to become involved in the security industry.  As is the case with all incidents of criminality that are reported or become known to the Garda, such incidents relating to the operation of licensed premises or nightclubs are the subject of Garda investigation and an investigation file is submitted to the law officers.  It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment at this time regarding any such investigations.The Private Security Authority, PSA, is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry.  One of the primary reasons for its establishment in 2005 was to prevent undesirable people becoming involved in the security business.  The vetting of applicants and, in the case of contractor licensing, the checking of criminal records by the Garda is an integral part of this licensing process.  The Garda liaises closely with the authority in assisting it in discharging its statutory functions, particularly in respect of complaints received, breaches of the relevant legislative provisions and the provision of security clearance for applications for licences.  An assistant commissioner of the Garda is on the board of the PSA.I am determined that all actions will be taken to prevent any attempt by illegal organisations to use legitimate businesses, such as those licensed by the authority, to further their criminal activities. I  have arranged a three-way meeting to take place shortly at a senior level between my officials, the authority and the Garda that will consider whether anything further can be done in this regard.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Does the Minister accept that, in some locations in this city, there are individuals acting as door men granting or denying access to licensed premises or pubs who are basically thugs?  Does he acknowledge the ongoing turf war between criminal gangs and former or current dissidents to control who will be given this type of security business?  Does he acknowledge that the war is resulting in lives being placed at serious risk?  What action is he taking to provide protection to the owners of nightclubs and pubs who have been forced into the predicament of having no choice but to recruit such individuals for fear of their premises being placed at risk, their businesses being destroyed and their custom evaporating?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Any nightclub owner with difficulties in this regard must communicate with the Garda Síochána, which will act on the complaint as the rightful body to respond.When the Oireachtas passed the Act in 2004, it did not decide that everyone with a criminal record should be barred from working in the private security area.  Rather, it took a more sensible approach because criminal records can be acquired for relatively small offences.  Deputy Shatter referred to people on the doors as thugs.  I take it he was not referring to everyone as such.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Of course not.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	288	However, there may be people with criminal records who are using force in some instances.  The PSA is the regulatory authority in this respect.  The individual and the contractor must be licensed.  Under section 22 of the Act, the authority shall not issue a licence to someone who "is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service".  Since its inception, approximately 36,000 checks of criminal records have been conducted by the Garda on behalf of the PSA.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	289	In the interests of saving lives and preserving law and order, the Garda should be encouraged not to wait for a complaint from a pub or nightclub owner who may fear for his or her personal safety.  The Garda should actively visit some of the premises in question with a view to identifying and speaking with individuals employed as bouncers in order to check their backgrounds and bona fides.  It should take whatever action is necessary to bring the reported turf war between criminal gangs and dissident republicans to a rapid end and to initiate any prosecution that might be required.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The Garda has a number of specialist units that investigate issues like this constantly.  It needs no encouragement from me.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The report by the World Health Organisation relies primarily on data from a variety of medical and health related sources across Europe.  In the case of Ireland, the data comes, essentially, from the CSO's medical and health related data, rather than from crime statistics.  Statistics on deaths are compiled from data supplied on the medical cause of death certificate completed by medical practitioners and coroners.  The report acknowledges that there are limitations in the data used and notes that since countries' systems and practices for recording and processing health data vary, the availability and accuracy of the data reported to WHO may vary.  Any interpretations of the report should take account of these factors.The CSO's recorded crime statistics show that the number of cases of murder and manslaughter involving a knife declined from 32 in 2007 to 19 in 2009.  In the first half of this year there were eight such cases.  The CSO crime statistics showed a 35% decrease in the overall number of cases murder and manslaughter last year and the year before, compared to 2007.  I am glad this trend has continued in the current year and the figures for the second quarter of 2010 show a 20% decrease in the number of murders compared to the same period in 2009.While this trend is welcome, I and the Government are concerned at the incidence of homicides among young people, especially involving knives.  Legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is extremely robust and heavy penalties are in place.  Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, there is a maximum penalty of five years for possessing a knife in a public place and the Garda Síochána has an extended power of search without warrant.The WHO report highlights the misuse of alcohol as a factor in homicides.  The Government has also provided increased powers to the Garda to deal with public order problems arising form the misuse of alcohol, including powers under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 to confiscate alcohol.  In 2009, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a knife awareness campaign to inform and educate young people on the dangers of carrying knives with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime.  The campaign targeted a young male audience with messages delivered through role models in the sporting and media worlds and incorporated a series of local roadshow events as well a dedicated website and a presence on social networking sites.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Instead of rubbishing the WHO statistics, the Minister might be better employed telling me what he will do about that organisation's findings which state we have the highest homicide rate among young men in western Europe and the second highest for knife killings.  Is it not the case that there were eight knife killings in 2003, some 21 in 2005 and 37 in 2007?  It is a shocking report.  If the Minister is challenging the validity of the figures, have he or his Department taken any steps to complain to the WHO that it has got its statistics wrong?  Does the Minister agree it is absolutely shocking to find a reputable organisation such as the WHO drawing attention to the fact that Ireland is at the top of the league in western Europe for homicides among young males and second highest for killings by knife?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I do not debunk the WHO statistics.  I merely pointed out what was in its report and the fact that the statistics are compiled from medical records.  The Central Statistics Office has compiled figures in regard to murder and manslaughter on the basis of dedicated crime statistics.  Although the Deputy quoted the level of killings, the figure for this type of killing for 2007 was 32.  He did not continue to state, as I did——
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Minister did it for me.  I did not want to repeat it.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	295	——that there has been a reduction since 2007 based on the crime statistics.  It is the case there is a level of crime in this regard which nobody in this society wants.  That is the reason I introduced the specific gangland crime and handgun ban legislation, about which the Deputy's party was somewhat watery.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Some Deputies wish to speak.  I call on Deputy Rabbitte, to be followed by Deputy McGrath.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	297	It is not about gangland killings although we can have that debate if the Minister wishes to have it.  There is casual resort by young people in the community to the use of knives.  I already spoke to the Minister about a situation in an area of my constituency during the week when the residents were up in arms about the absence of policing and the difficulties people have, feeling they have been thrown to the wolves and that nobody in authority cares.  We should not confuse this with the gangland assassinations of big-time crooks.  We are talking about the casual resort to the use of knives by young males.  What does the Minister think he can do about it?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The WHO figures refer to a cohort of people aged between 19 and 35.  A substantial number of people in that cohort who were killed during the period in question were killed not as a result of knife crime, but as a result of gangland crime.  It is wrong to say this has nothing to do with gangland crime.Concerning knife crime, when I became Minister, we looked very closely at the epidemic of knife crime which was taking place in the UK and as a result I introduced legislation that increased the relevant penalty from one year to five years in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  In addition, I sat down with the Garda Síochána and as a result it brought forward a substantial knife awareness campaign directed at that type of person who is likely to bring a knife out at night.I accept fully what the Deputy said regarding certain geographic areas of Dublin and around the country.  However, much work has been done by the Garda in youth diversion projects in those areas to try to assist young people and prevent them getting into crime.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Regarding legislation to deal with knife killings, does the Minister believe that legislation which is already on the Statute Book has been implemented fully by gardaí on the ground?  Has the knife awareness campaign run by the Department of Justice and Law Reform been effective?  What is the Minister's impression of it?In regard to the criminal justice system, is the Minister aware there is a significant section of society that firmly believes the criminal justice system has let them down?  I refer in particular to areas of serious economic disadvantage where major assaults take place of which many go unreported, and major anti-social activity.  The entire community believes that nobody cares.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The Deputy is widening the scope of the question and has asked three questions.  I ask him to be brief.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Regarding the link between knife crime and small local anti-social activity, what proposals does the Minister have to do something about it?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	303	As to the effectiveness of the campaign, only time will tell.  Obviously, knife crime continues.  There is a problem with a knife.  In the Department we examined whether there was any way of banning knives as offensive weapons.  The fact is that a knife from any kitchen press is a dangerous implement.  An innocent knife used for cutting bread can become an offensive weapon within seconds.  It would be impractical, therefore, to ban knives or, as somebody suggested, to ban "sharp pointed" knives in this country.  We considered increasing sentences which would send out a very strong signal.  To the best of my knowledge that legislation is being drawn up.As a representative of an urban area, I can understand the issue to which the Deputy referred, namely, that some people believe the criminal justice system has left them behind.  There are the 100 youth diversion projects throughout the country, mostly in urban disadvantaged areas.  These are successful as I know from my own constituency.  There are people outside such activities, however, and no matter what one does with them, they will still indulge in crime.  The campaign was designed to try to suggest to young people that it is not cool to put a knife in one's pocket when one goes out at night.  The minute a person has a knife and is known to have one others on the opposite side of a gang will also bring a knife.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	305	The disturbing reality is that it has become the norm for some groups of young people to carry knives.  I welcome the Minister's initiatives to bring about an awareness campaign but will he confirm to the House whether that campaign will continue this year, next year and the year following?  Can the Minister confirm to the House whether that campaign will continue this year, next year and the year after?  We need gardaí explaining to young people in the schools the difficulties with knives.  We need to break that cycle, the norm as regards young people carrying knives.  I should like to see much more action in that regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	306	With regard to the continuance of the awareness campaign, my understand is that it is ongoing, but I will relay the Deputy's comments on the need for gardaí to liaise with schools, etc.  I understand that this was part of the campaign but I shall bring his comments to the attention of the Garda Commissioner.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	307	Why does the Minister say that the WHO drawing its information from medical records could be inaccurate?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I would hazard a guess that a more accurate figure may be gleaned from the CSO crime statistics rather than medical certificates.  Sometimes a death by knife could be recorded, for instance, but this might not necessarily be a crime.  It could refer to an injury that occurred accidentally.  That is one instance, perhaps, of a more accurate gauge of crime statistics.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform may make a deportation order that requires any foreign national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter out of the State.  Thus, a deportation order is a requirement imposed on a person to leave the State and to remain outside of the State.  Where a person fails to leave the State, he or she is required to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB.Details of the number of deportation orders signed and effected in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 August 2010 are as follows: in 2008, there were a total of 757 deportation orders signed, of which 161 were effected; in 2009, there were a total of 1,077 deportation orders signed, of which 291 were effected; up until 31 August this year, I have signed 495 deportation orders, of which 171 were effected by that date.So as to give the House the full picture I should also add that in the period in question a further 529 persons in 2008, 539 persons in 2009 and 286 persons up to 31 August 2010 also left the State as voluntary returns.  A further 271 persons in 2008, 243 persons in 2009 and 114 persons up to 31 August 2010 were returned to other EU member States under the Dublin regulation.  An additional 40 EU citizens in 2008, 29 EU citizens in 2009 and 18 EU citizens up to 31 August 2010 were removed to their home country under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006.The figures for deportation orders effected I have provided to the House reflect the numbers of deportations that have been enforced, by the GNIB by escorting individuals to another State or by placing them on a carrier leaving the State.  It is generally accepted that many other persons served with a deportation order leave the State at that stage but do not inform the immigration authorities of their departure.Clearly, the making of a deportation order has the most serious consequences for individuals in  that it renders their continued presence in the State unlawful. The gardaí who enforce all the deportation orders advise that it is their view that very many people who are the subject of deportation orders will have already left the State.Moreover, it is also the case that in this jurisdiction as it is in others, that significant numbers of people who are the subject of deportation orders leave voluntarily on receipt of the order. As exit checks from the State are not in use, it is not possible to indicate with any degree of precision the numbers who may be in this category but all the available evidence suggests that the number is likely to be considerable.A deportation order is normally accompanied by a notice requiring the person concerned to comply with arrangements to ensure that he or she leaves the State. Failure to comply with those arrangements is an offence and can result in the person being arrested and detained to ensure his or her removal from the State.  Furthermore, the enforcement of some deportations can be delayed by judicial challenges taken by the parties involved.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I calculate that approximately a quarter of those persons served with a deportation orders are deported.  Would the Minister again give the figures for the persons who leave voluntarily?  I do not know what means of validation exist for the numbers that leave voluntarily.  At what point does the serving of a deportation order that is never implemented discredit the system?  Has the time not come for us to address the backlog that has grown up over a number of years, as regards people who have sought leave to remain or whatever, put down roots in Ireland and had children here and so on, while we do not seem to be able to catch up with matters administratively?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I gave the figures earlier for voluntary returns.  These refer to people notified to the Department as going.  Any social welfare benefits and otherwise they might have been in receipt of would cease from that point onwards.  In some instances the GNIB in Ennis would have facilitated their return.  The figures are 529 persons in 2008, 539 in 2009 and 286 up to 31 August 2010.  Equally, there is a substantial number of people who returned without any reference, and without any information being relayed to the Garda or State services.  We do not have exit checks from this State, bearing in mind the Border as well.  People may very well leave once they have been served with or know that a deportation order has been served.The benefit of serving a deportation order in regard to somebody whose whereabouts are not known to the Garda means that the cessation of any benefits he or she might have been entitled to is complete.  If he or she comes back into the system seeking social welfare or any other benefits, the fact that a deportation order is against him or her means that this will be brought to the attention of the authorities, and obviously an arrest will take place thereafter.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I believe the Minister said there were 529 voluntary departures in 2008, 539 in 2009 and 286 in 2010.  Is that correct?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	313	There were 286 up to the end of August.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I find that puzzling.  If one adds 529 to 161, it comes to virtually all 757 of the deportation orders implemented.  The remarkable thing about 2010 is that if one adds 286 to 126 one gets 412 and there were only 353 deportation orders.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	315	On a point of clarification, the voluntary returns might not necessarily have been served.  They might have been about to be served with a deportation order.

Then he said that was not taking the voluntary departures into account.  When I add the voluntary departures to the departures implemented I get a figure that is more than the number of deportation orders in the first place.

Then I said that in those years there were also voluntary returns.  I said, "So as to give the House the full picture I should also add that in the period in question so many voluntary returns . . .", and then there was the issue in relation to the free movement of persons.  I was trying to give as full a picture as possible regarding how many people in the system would have left.  At the same time I indicated that there was a substantial number of people who would never come to the attention of the authorities if they had returned.  They disappear out of the system.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	325	On this point, that is not what the Minister said.  For example, I have his previous answer before me.  It says, "Overall, the level of evasion, the lodgement of judicial challenges and the likely voluntary departure from the State of persons served with a deportation order...".  It is not a question of people additional and separate from those served with a deportation order.  I regard it as a serious matter to try something like that here when it is very easy to do the maths.  There were 412 people left, who were served with deportation orders but only 353 were served with deportation orders.

Of these, how many had been served with a deportation order?  Do those who return voluntarily pay for their flights or boat journeys, or does the State pay for them?  The total number of people deported — again, over a period of two years and eight months — was 623.  What travel agency was used for arranging the flights or trips of those who were deported and those who left voluntarily?

With regard to the mode of return, when a person is issued with a notice of intention to deport — the 15-day letter — he or she is given the option, among others, of returning voluntarily to his or her country and is provided with contact details of the International Organisation for Migration.  The IOM has informed us that since the programme's inception in 2001, it has assisted a total of 2,716 people in returning to their countries of origin up to September of this year.As per the memorandum of understanding signed between my Department and the IOM, the estimated total budget for 2010 is €1.447 million, which is broken down into two parts: the voluntary assisted return and re-integration programme, which is funded by the Department and has a budget of €958,584, and the new targeted irregular migrants programme, which has an estimated budget of €488,449.  Funding for this new programme will be provided by the Department of Justice and Law Reform but it is co-financed by the European Return Fund.  A target of 205 returns under the original programme was set in 2010, with the programme running to 31 December 2010.

The prison development at Thornton Hall remains a cornerstone of our prison modernisation programme.The Government recently approved the procurement of the first phase of the prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities for the prison campus at Thornton Hall.  The first phase will see the provision of 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners.  This project has been identified in the Government's Infrastructure Investment Priorities 2010-2016 and funding is being made available from within the capital envelope for my Department.The Deputy may also wish to know that a contract for the construction of the access road to serve the prison development was awarded to SIAC Construction in July, and construction work is already under way on this phase of the project.  The access road and underpass are scheduled to be completed in February of next year.A procurement competition for the installation of off-site services to serve the prison development issued to companies on the Irish Prison Service construction framework in August.  The closing date was 6 October 2010 and evaluation of the tenders by the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisers has commenced.  It is intended to award the contract in respect of the off-site works in November.  The work will take approximately eight months to complete.The procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison is already in progress.  A pre-qualification competition from which suitably qualified contractors will be invited to tender for the design and construction of the perimeter wall of the prison and related works issued on the e-Tenders website in August 2010.  The closing date for expressions of interest was 28 September 2010.Twenty submissions were received and the evaluation of these submissions is already under way.  A panel comprising five to seven contractors will be established from this procurement competition and these contractors will be invited to tender for the construction of the wall later this month.  Construction of the perimeter security wall is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and will take just under a year to complete.  The procurement process for the design and construction of the first phase of prison accommodation blocks will begin early in 2011.Thus far, a total of €24.46 million has been expended on the project to the end of September 2010.  This sum includes the site cost of €29.9 million.

This was done following representations from the local community.The total expenditure to date also includes €7.3 million expended on professional fees, €2.9 million on site preparation and various surveys, €0.5 million on landscaping and €0.5 million on security.  As is the case with all major infrastructure projects, a comprehensive set of geological, engineering and archaeological and environmental surveys have been undertaken at the site in order to advance the construction programme for the development.

Does he not accept that delivery of what he terms the modernisation of the prison estate in this fashion will end up costing the State more in the long run, given the security concerns associated with returning to the site to build the rest of the project after the first phase has opened?  Would he not agree that a fraction of the €42.46 million, if it had been invested in community restorative justice, probation and welfare services, links projects, detox beds, or even improvement of the existing prison estate, would have had a greater effect in terms of reducing the prison population?

Substantial consultation took place before the project and one of the conditions specified by the community was that a considerable amount of tree planting would take place to offset the look of and potential noise from the prison.With regard to the overall cost, many of the projects mentioned by the Deputy — I mentioned earlier the 100 youth diversion projects around the State, including drug treatment centres and so on — are already being funded, although there is always a need for more.  Prisons face a difficulty in that they cannot put up a "No vacancies" sign but must accept everybody.  People such as the Deputies criticise the conditions in Mountjoy and other prisons, and that is one of the reasons we are rapidly proceeding with the Thornton Hall project.  We are planning for the long term.

Have the moneys been provided and are they assured for this project?Has any consideration been given in the Minister's Department to the abandonment of this project and given that a very much smaller capacity is being built could it have been done in the conventional way?  For example, is it not the case that when this dreadful Government, which has brought us to the stage we are in, was throwing money around like drunken sailors it spent €24 million acquiring a site adjacent to Mountjoy?  Did the Department give any consideration to developing that site as an alternative to this monstrosity at an unsuitable location in rural north Dublin?  Is there still not time to reconsider his approach?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I do not accept that it is in an isolated rural area.  It is in an area which is contiguous with Dublin and will be accessible.  I am surprised that even Deputy Rabbitte accepts that having a major prison in the city centre of Dublin is a good idea in this day and age, particularly given the difficulties in keeping drugs out of that location.This will be a purpose-built prison.  Given that the economic circumstances changed since the original planning for Thornton Hall, rather than criticising it, the Deputy should accept it was necessary to reappraise its financing.  While I have not finished my consideration of the Estimates for next year I am confident, given that this is a vital piece of infrastructure for the country, that there will be sufficient funds.  The tendering process for the actual building of the prison will start in 2011.  That we have proceeded with the access road, the underpass, the off-site services and the perimeter wall strongly suggests, given that we have got the consent of the Department of Finance, this is a vital infrastructure that needs to be put in place.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I presume the Minister would acknowledge this debacle is not all his fault, that this project is, as some of his colleagues refer to it, the McDowell legacy, in the sense that it was never properly thought out or adequately or reasonably costed.  In the context of the reappraisal of the State's financial position and its capacity to spend money, is there a risk, if the wall is proceeded with, that it could become the most expensive wall in the history of the State and that the State ever built around a piece of farmland, with perhaps the best access road completed into the back yard?  Will the Minister give an assurance there is no doubt that the 400-cell facility will be constructed?

I do not accept that it is a debacle.  This is a properly thought out project which is necessary for the prison population for the next 15 to 20 years.  It is a vital piece of infrastructure, without which we will difficulty and adverse reports from the inspector of prisons.

Returning to the question I asked, the Minister will recall before the collapse of the PPP, when I asked if he was sure the developer, the preferred bidder, was able to deliver, he got up on his high horse and told me he would never speak to a developer, that would be a dreadful thing to do.

Is there a danger we will be left with a road into a field, around which a fin wall will have been built?  What does the Minister propose to do with the Mountjoy Prison site which he acquired for €24 million, and which I presume is now worth €2 million or €3 million, and why could it not be developed?  I do not agree with what the Minister said about the location of the prison.  The people who have to visit relatives in prison do not need, in the absence of public transport, to go to a remote location in north County Dublin.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Leo Varadkar — the loss of beds in hospitals in north Dublin; (2) Deputy Jan O'Sullivan — the proposed cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; (3) Deputy Mary Upton — the position regarding the free pre-school year; and (4) Deputy James Bannon — the position regarding the national network of cycle paths.The matters raised by Deputies Leo Varadkar, Jan O'Sullivan, Mary Upton and James Bannon have been selected for discussion and will be taken now.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this important issue which relates to Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, in my constituency of Dublin West.  As the Minister will, no doubt, be aware the hospital currently has a deficit of €4.5 million out of its annual budget of €91 million.  As a result, the hospital has been prevailed upon by the HSE to close a number of hospital beds.  Ten beds are closed already, another 14 closed last week, bringing to a total of 24, the number of beds closed in Connolly Hospital.  This is in addition to the 30 beds that have closed at the Mater Hospital and 64 in Beaumont Hospital, resulting in a total of more than 110 beds closed in the north Dublin region.  Hospitals in the north Dublin region are facing additional pressure because of the removal of surgical services from Navan Hospital.  It is clear we are heading into a bad winter in the accident and emergency units of our hospitals.I have worked in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, in the accident and emergency unit and in the medicine for the elderly department.  I have also worked in the accident and emergency unit in Beaumont Hospital.  I worked in a system that was already overcrowded and full of trolleys when there were 100 more beds in the system than there will be this winter.  We are heading for a monumental disaster, a breakdown in medical care and a serious loss of life in the north Dublin hospitals, as a result of the current situation.    We all accept that health spending will be reduced over the coming years and this year, but there has been a failure of the Government and HSE management to get the deficit under control much earlier.I suggest that three things be done.  First, a similar approach should be taken to that which was taken to the banking sector.  There should be a bailout of these hospitals for the remainder of this year.  Second, the management of the HSE and the hospitals, who have contributed to this crisis by not dealing with the emerging deficit much earlier, should be replaced.  Finally, a new funding system should be introduced next year based on the Fine Gael model of universal health insurance, where money follows the patient and hospitals are paid for the work they do, the number of patients they treat and the number of inpatients they have.  Under this system, hospitals will never again try to making savings to meet their budgets by closing down hospital wards and cutting back on services.  The whole situation is reminiscent of that famous "Yes Minister" episode where we are told by the civil servants that the most efficient hospital is one with no patients.  Clearly, the current Government takes the same view that we achieve budget targets by closing down services.  That is not the way it should be and I look forward to the Minister's response.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.It is important to note that the number of inpatient beds open at any one time is only one indicator of the volume of service that hospitals can actually provide.  Services should be provided on an outpatient or day case basis whenever possible, with patients only being admitted to acute inpatient care when it is essential to do so.  In turn, this will involve reducing inappropriate hospital admissions, more same day of surgery admissions, more day-care cases and earlier discharges and reductions in waiting times for elective surgery.The planned changes announced by the three hospitals are designed to allow them to deliver their service plan targets while remaining within budget.  The HSE has assured the Department of Health and Children that none of the national speciality beds in these hospitals — neurosurgery, transplantation and cancer services in Beaumont, and heart and lung and national spinal injuries services in the Mater — have been affected by these bed reductions.The reduction of beds must also be seen in the context of the reduction of delayed discharges.  Since 2006, the winter initiative has focused on addressing the fundamental issues such as its code of practice for integrated discharge planning.  This is being driven across the country by joint implementation groups, which have been formed across each geographic region and include hospital and community personnel.  In 2009, the delayed discharge peak for the Beaumont and Mater Hospitals was 176 and 121 respectively.  The total number of delayed discharges has now decreased in both hospitals to 70 and 69 respectively.The nursing homes support scheme, known as "A Fair Deal", which has helped reduce delays in discharging patients from hospital, alleviates pressures on beds.  An additional €97 million was provided for this scheme in the budget for 2010.  Since the introduction of the scheme, it is estimated that the number of patients discharged from the Dublin academic teaching hospitals to nursing home care has more than trebled to 23 per week, equating to about 1,200 annually.An initiative was put in place for seven hospitals, including the Mater and Beaumont, which were considered to have particular problems in emergency department waiting times.  Each hospital has agreed specific work plans to drive performance improvements with targets in place, with progress being monitored on a weekly basis.  Furthermore, a number of developments are also taking place in the three hospitals that reduce the need for inpatient beds.  The Mater Smithfield rapid injury clinic, which opened in April 2010, acts as a satellite service to the Mater Hospital's emergency department.  It has the capacity to reduce significantly patient waiting times as it can cater for at least 30% of the hospital's main emergency department cases.  The clinic has treated over 4,000 patients since its opening in April 2010.Building works currently underway for the Mater Hospital and scheduled for completion in early 2012 will provide a new accident and emergency department, a new outpatients department, 12 new theatres and intensive care unit and high dependency unit departments containing 36 beds, a new radiology department and 120 replacement beds in single rooms.  During the summer, the HSE commissioned 32 additional step-down beds in the orthopaedic hospital at Clontarf for Beaumont Hospital.  In addition, Beaumont Hospital is planning to commission 100 long-term care beds at St. Joseph's Hospital in Raheny.Connolly Hospital is currently developing a medical assessment unit to increase patient access to senior clinical decision makers. This is due to come on stream in the new year.   A new CT scanner was also installed in 2009 to provide increased diagnostic capabilities.Reforming the way these services are provided, reducing costs, and maintaining a clear focus on patient safety will allow us to treat people in more effective ways and protect access to appropriate services.  The implementation of this type of patient centred reforms by the Mater, Beaumont and Connolly Hospitals have the Minister's full support.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I regret that the Minister for Health and Children is not here to answer this matter on the Adjournment, not on my own behalf but on behalf of the young people who so desperately need answers on cystic fibrosis facilities.  I hope the Minister of State will have answers for them.The lives of cystic fibrosis patients depend on the speed at which the promised single-bed unit in St. Vincent's Hospital is delivered.  Will the contract be signed on Friday 15 October, as has been indicated?  How long will it take to build and how soon will it be open?It is a national shame that these young adults, including household names such as Orla Tinsley, Anita Slowey, Gillian McNulty and others have had to go on the national airways and the front of our daily newspapers to get this most basic and vital service, namely, a hospital bed in a room on their own so that they are not exposed to the kind of cross infections that can take their young lives away.  They have spoken out so eloquently, bravely and passionately that my time is better used putting their words, rather than mine, on the record.  Anita Slowey wrote to RTE this week and her letter is reprinted on the front of today's Irish Examiner.  She said:Cross infection and multiple infection has resulted in the bugs that cause the infections in my body becoming stronger and harder to fight; out of the hundreds of antibiotics used to treat my disease I am only sensitive to one.  This is as a direct result of being exposed to other patients and their germs in unisolated conditions in St. Vincent's Hospital.  The result of this is that where I would normally spend two weeks in hospital getting better, I now spend between one and a half and two months fighting endless infections.  In the last two years, I have spent ten months of that in St. Vincent's Hospital — the majority of which was in six bed wards.Even though I have survived, every infection and sleepless night in St. Vincent's Hospital has slowly robbed me of a little more lung power, a little more energy, a little more spirit, and the will to survive has been slowly eroded away.That is a very graphic description of the life and death situation in which these young patients find themselves.  One young woman said on radio that she was asked to take part in a photograph on the site of the new unit when she was 18.  She is now 31 and not a sod has been turned.Other countries have much better facilities for these young people, where single bed wards are the norm, where they are not subject to these cross infections and where their lifespans are much longer.  What they need from us is plain words and clear answers.  Will the contract be signed on Friday week?  How long will it take to build and fit out?  Will the staffing be in place as soon as the building is ready to open?  Can the single-bed units that do exist at the moment in St. Vincent's Hospital be available for cystic fibrosis patients?  I hope there will be clear answers to these questions.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Without being glib, I fully understand the huge distress caused by cystic fibrosis.  I remember well the presentations made when I was chairman of the health committee three years ago, and I will try to be as direct as I can.  I am afraid the Minister could not be here this evening.I am aware that the site has been cleared.  The brief from the Department on the signing of the contract is imminent.  I know that the word "imminent" can be stretched out, but I am satisfied that the development will take 18 months, and I have been told that it will be completed in early 2012.This has been on the agenda for quite some time.  We are about to enter the tender process and the clear commitment has been to 2012.  It is in all our interests to ensure that we maintain these deadlines and watch the progress as we go through each month.  While it might sound a bit hollow, the building of the new ward block at St. Vincent's hospital is a priority for the Government given that we are making the case and the tender is imminent.  The Minister and the HSE have the same priority.  St. Vincent's hospital and the HSE are working to ensure the earliest possible delivery of the new ward block.  The Department has been advised by St. Vincent's hospital that the signing of the contract to commence the project is imminent.  The site has been cleared and is ready for construction to begin.  Construction will take 18 months and completion is expected early in 2012.  The development at the hospital will provide a state-of-the-art clinical building which will include up-to-date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.I am aware of this morning's letter from Anita Slowey and I have heard Orla Tinsley on numerous occasions.  We are aware of the urgency of ensuring that the commitments given here today will remain intact.  This 100-bed inpatient unit with single en-suite rooms will accommodate the needs of patients with cystic fibrosis and many other patients whose medical requirements necessitate single en-suite facilities.  This reflects best practice in terms of infection control.  It will also provide ten single-day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.  The hospital has been in regular contact with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and with the cystic fibrosis patient liaison group in the hospital.  It has explained the detail of the process that is being worked through.The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland has accepted that the tender process will be completed very shortly.  Clearly, I would prefer to be in a position to say what "shortly" means, but I believe it will be within a number of weeks.  When that process is completed construction will commence.  The physical infrastructure at St. Vincent's hospital has been significantly enhanced through a number of completed capital projects in recent years.  In 2008, the accommodation was refurbished to provide eight single en-suite rooms for the exclusive use of people with cystic fibrosis.  The hospital's management works closely with the cystic fibrosis clinicians to ensure that the needs of cystic fibrosis patients requiring inpatient treatment are met within the overall bed complement at the hospital.  There are currently 63 beds at St. Vincent's hospital used for respiratory and cystic fibrosis services.  The hospital currently treats more than 50% of Irish adults with cystic fibrosis.  The HSE is now working with St. Vincent's hospital to identify opportunities for patients who do not require tertiary level care to be treated closer to home where adult services have been developed in the other specialist centres.Funding has been provided for the recruitment of additional specialist staff at St. Vincent's hospital and other hospitals which provide specialist care as part of a national initiative to improve care for patients with cystic fibrosis.  These staff include consultant, nursing and allied health professionals.  The Minister and the HSE are committed to this very important project at St. Vincent's hospital which will improve the services available to patients with cystic fibrosis attending the hospital.  I am not in a position to answer the Deputy's question regarding the use of rooms at present and I will respond to her during the week.

I have also raised the issue a number of times in this House.  Every day that those people wait for a bed their lives are literally being put at risk.  I also take this opportunity to note the need for post-transplant facilities for cystic fibrosis patients within St. Vincent's hospital.  This is a debate that has gone on for a long time and we need action urgently.I have made a number of representations to the Minister of State with responsibility for Children and Youth Affairs on the anomalies in the free preschool year scheme.  Every reply contains the exact same information, which is that the scheme as it stands is working adequately and will not be changed, but this is not my experience.The concept of the free preschool is laudable, and it may be working well for a large number of people.  However, I know of a number of individuals for whom it is not working.  First, the age limit on eligibility precludes a number of children from availing of the free preschool year.  It seems to be discriminatory to put in place an age range which, by adhering to it, means that some children, who will be eligible to attend primary school the following year, fall outside that range.  It is not right that a child may be accepted in to a primary school at a certain age, but is outside the age range for the preschool in the previous year.  For example, a child who is aged three in September is not eligible for a preschool place, but the same child, the following September, aged four, is eligible for a place in a primary school.  This means that a number of children within those age brackets — it is only approximately two months — will fall outside the net.If the Minister of State believes children should not be allowed to attend a primary school unless they are aged four years and two months in September, then he should say so.  That gap causes an anomaly which precludes a number of children from availing of the free preschool year.  Telling them they can wait for another year just puts an additional financial burden on their parents and does not solve the problem.  The Minister of State has stated to me that this is a rule that applied to the "majority".  Why is there a minority that is excluded and I seem to know a number of them?  I do not understand the logic behind this rule.Second, a number of anomalies exist in a playschool or preschool where different categories of children are being catered for.  In a recent reply the Minister of State pointed out that parents may supplement the food for the children, by providing their own.  I am aware of preschools and playschools with different categories of children qualifying for different subsidies.  Some of them are entitled to free lunch or fruit snacks and others are not.  It is not acceptable to stand by and tell a four year old or a three year old that he or she cannot have his or her quota of chopped-up apples today, but his or her friend in the same group can.  This is not the real world, where in a disadvantaged area there will be different categories of children whose parents have different incomes.  Is it reasonable or sensible to discriminate between the children who are getting subsidies, and those who are not, based on income?I am asking the Minister to review the scheme to allow for those children who are eligible for primary school in any given year to also be eligible for preschool the previous year, regardless of their age.  I realise this only applies to a small number of children, but that small number is very important.  I am also asking the Minister of State to review the various subsidy systems that exist whereby children within the same playgroup must be treated differently.  For those places that are in receipt of various different subsidies, those who must pay full rate are not entitled to any subsidy are now keeping their children at home.  Many people whose income is just above the threshold are unable to afford the fee meaning that their only option is to keep the child at home, which is very discriminatory against that particular disadvantaged group that is on the margins and just outside the income level.  I am asking the Minister of State to review the basis of the various subsidy schemes so that every child has a real chance of availing of a preschool place and not just those who can afford it.  The current situation is simply creating another poverty trap for the marginalised.The primary purpose of raising this matter is to address the anomaly regarding the age groups whereby by being a month or two outside the bracket certain children fall through the net and do not get the free preschool year.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I apologise that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, could not be here to take this matter.  The introduction of the free preschool year in early childhood care and education scheme is one of the most significant developments in early childhood care and education to have taken place in Ireland to date.  Building on the progress made over the past decade, in terms of investing in child care and in developing educational frameworks for young children, we are now taking the first major step in providing universal preschool education for all children.  More than 4,200 preschool services are now participating in the scheme and providing the free preschool year to some 63,000 children.  This represents 94% of children in the year before starting school and is, I believe, a staggering achievement within nine months of the introduction of the scheme.In addition, almost all preschool services in the country are participating in the scheme.  These figures are testimony to the quality of our preschool services in responding to both the opportunities and challenges of the new scheme and to the commitment of parents to the importance of early learning for their children at a key developmental stage of their lives.  While there is a potential for anomalies in any new scheme which is introduced, the Minister believes that the free preschool year scheme is working extraordinarily well for the vast majority of preschool service providers and for parents and their preschool children and I would not accept that there are any significant anomalies with its implementation.  The Minister believes this is borne out by the very high participation levels achieved by the start of its first full year.  Children are eligible for the free preschool year where they are aged between three years and three months and four years and six months in September of the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 qualified for the free preschool year in September 2010.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age, or where local primary school enrolment policy requires them to start junior infants aged five years and seven months or older.The scheme does not provide for any exceptions to the lower age of just over three years and two months at which children become eligible to avail of the free preschool year.  The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the preschool year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the preschool year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children participate in the scheme each year.  In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of four years and six months and five years and six months.  Notwithstanding that, the ECCE scheme provides for an eligibility range of almost 17 months.  As in the case of any scheme introduced, cases will arise where individuals would prefer if certain conditions did not apply.  However, the scheme must remain sufficiently targeted to ensure the best delivery of pre-school education and it is considered, therefore, that the age range provided for is appropriate.Research underpins the importance of delivering preschool provision in a consistent format based within an appropriate educational framework.  For this reason, the preschool year scheme has been designed to provide some 570 hours for each participating child, which will be delivered on a weekly basis over the course of each year.  Added flexibility is provided under the scheme for children with special needs who would benefit from availing of the pre-school year on a pro-rata basis over two years.  This is very helpful to parents whose children may also be attending a special needs service but wish their children to avail of mainstream provision to the greatest extent possible.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is also working closely with the Office of Disability and Mental Health with a view to optimising the current arrangements for the delivery of special needs supports for preschool children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, hopes that this process will lead to improved arrangements at local level and greater access for children with special needs to mainstream services.  Rather than wait until September 2010, the free preschool year was introduced in January of this year resulting in a shorter period of provision at that point.As I have said, the first full year of the scheme came into effect this September.  I would accept that this could be seen as an anomaly; however, the alternative would have been to delay the scheme and its benefits from the parents and children who would have missed out by a later introduction date.  The shorter year provision in January 2010 was clearly signalled and was highlighted on the parent declaration forms that all parents were required to sign when enrolling their children into the scheme.  An annual capitation fee of over €2,400 is paid to participating services.  This is equivalent to €64.50 per week where a service is participating for 38 weeks and €48.50 per week where it participates for 50 weeks.A higher capitation fee of €2,850 per annum is available to sessional play-school services in which all child care workers have specified qualification levels which are above the minimum requirements for the scheme.  For most services, the scheme has seen an increase in their income and allows them to meet the higher standards required for participation relative to the existing requirements under the child care regulations.  These higher standards concerning qualification of staff and the educational programme guided by Síolta will ensure that a quality service is provided to all children in their preschool year and not just those whose parents can afford to pay higher fees.The Minister believes the decision to introduce the scheme at this time was far-sighted.  The free preschool year gives equal opportunities to all children, particularly the most marginalised who would not otherwise be able to attend pre-school, as well as helping parents who, up to now, had to meet the cost of preschool provision themselves.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to debate this important issue, namely, the need for the Minister for Transport to ensure that County Longford is included in, not excluded from, plans for a 2,000 kilometre national network of cycle paths, which will connect cities and towns across the State.  Can the Minister tell me the reason this county, which is the heart of Ireland and could be regarded as the central focal point where all routes cross, should have been the only county to be precluded in the first place from the Minister's vision of world class cycle routes, considering all Longford has to offer in terms of amenities, sporting facilities, natural resources and scenic landscapes?  The Minister should be aware that visions tend to be suspect at the best of times.  That one in particular seems to be flawed, and the grounds for accepting its validity seem shaky.This exclusion makes no sense.  To most people an all-Ireland nationwide network of 25 rather than 26 counties is a joke.  I would like to know the reason anyone could possibly plan or, in the case of the National Roads Authority, carry out a scoping study into the delivery of a national cycle network and, on foot of its findings, omit one county — my own county of Longford.I remind the Minister that County Longford is very much part of this nation.  There is outrage across the county as people cannot understand the reason a county with so much to offer could be left out of this exciting plan.  This is by no means the first initiative that Longford has been excluded from to the detriment of its economic well-being and development.  This omission is very worrying at a time of economic fallout from the loss of tourism revenue and record unemployment levels.I would like the Minister to outline the criteria that was used to select the route of the network and also the criteria for exclusion.  It makes no sense to me because this is a county which has the national primary route, the N4 from Dublin to Sligo, running through it and a national primary and secondary roads network — Rooskey to Rathowen and on to the Westmeath border, which is 35 kilometres.  That route could be extended to Mullingar and beyond.  The secondary route from the Granard-Cavan border to Tang, County Westmeath is 50 kilometres long and could be extended into the city of Athlone.  The Longford to Lanesboro road is 15 kilometres long with the potential of extension to Roscommon town.  These roads and others are more than wide enough to support a cycle lane.The cycle route would complement the recent reopening of the Royal Canal from Spencer Dock in Dublin to Richmond Harbour in Clondra, County Longford.  As has been seen across Europe, a canal network is a vibrant cross-country link between towns and rural areas, generating a view of the hidden interior rarely seen from motorways or trains.  A road network for cyclists would tie in with this amenity.  However, the canal is not a direct route and for those interested in road cycle routes which are not separated from the road by a grass verge or other barrier or heading away from the main areas, the roads network provides the quickest links.  The idea of a cycle network has been incredibly successful in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands.  Apart from the transport and leisure advantages, cycling is an extremely healthy activity and as such should be encouraged in all counties of Ireland, without exception.Longford, both north and south, has some of the most beautiful scenery in the country.  Its lakes, rivers and canal network provide a haven for tourists and locals alike for fishing, boating and other leisure pursuits.  It is my understanding that the nodes of the proposed network are settlements around Ireland, with populations of 10,000 or more and the proposed route corridors are linked to tourist attractions and amenities.  There are no grounds for excluding Longford.  The corridors will provide an outline around which routes will develop nationwide, with potential for linkage between corridors, particularly where existing infrastructure will allow for cost-effective delivery.  Again, there are no grounds for excluding Longford in that regard.County Longford is essentially on the offshoot of the Dublin to Galway route, which I understand will be the main artery of the network.  Common sense would lead one to see it as an integral part of any cycle network, as a final destination for those not wishing to undertake the longer route and as a stop-off point for those who do.  Tourists planning to cycle along parts of the network could not find a more attractive county to aim for or a destination more likely to provide for a sporting holiday than Longford.  The tie-in with the canal route allows for the possibility of cycling for part of the journey and travelling back by canal.  This strikes me as a good link-up of resources.On many occasions in this House and in the Seanad previously, I have highlighted the lack of funding for Longford-Westmeath and the removal of vital services.  However, I did not think that at any time I would have to defend the geographical and logistical right of the county to be included in the definition of the nation.  Longford was given neither hub nor gateway status and the pattern of exclusion seems set.  Why this should be so I cannot imagine, but I am not prepared to stand by while my county is again treated with contempt.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I remember passing through Longford one day and seeing a massive sewerage investment programme being developed.  That went on for years.  I am not trying to say that Longford lost a cycle route because so much went into Longford, far from it.  I just recognise that significant infrastructure went into Longford in its time.I am replying to this debate because, unfortunately, the Minister for Transport cannot be here this evening.  Reflecting the need to commence early progress towards a sustainable transport future as outlined in the Government's smarter travel plan 2009-2020, Ireland's first national cycle policy framework was published in April 2009.  The stated policy of this framework is to create a strong cycling culture in Ireland.  The overall target is that 10% of all trips will be by bicycle by 2020.  This is an ambitious target which means that cycling must be promoted and supported in all of our cities, towns and rural areas.The development of a national network of both rural and urban cycling routes is a specific objective of the cycling policy framework.  It identifies the need to deliver high quality cycle routes on a nationwide basis so as to encourage cycling for transport, leisure and tourism.  The policy framework also identifies that the delivery of interurban routes, in the form of a national cycle network, would be in addition to the recognised need for the provision of safe cycling routes within urban areas.  In response to that objective and at the Minister for Transport's request, the National Roads Authority undertook to carry out a scoping study on the extent of such a network.  The NRA engaged with a range of stakeholders during the preparation of this scoping study, including the National Trails Office, Fáilte Ireland, Waterways Ireland and the CIE group.  The range of stakeholders involved ensured that the study built on previous work and also engaged those who will be integral to the delivery of a national cycle network.  The scoping study has been completed by the NRA and is available on the smarter travel website.While the operational detail of the study and the assessments made are a matter for the NRA, the study outlines a number of key points.  A number of criteria were chosen for testing the various route corridor options, including connecting major cities and settlements of greater than 10,000 population; facilitating commuter, leisure and tourism usage; connecting to the proposed Fáilte Ireland network; utilising existing infrastructure; achieving good coverage nationwide; and promoting social and economic development.  The results are reflected in the strategic inter-urban corridors proposed in the study, which have a network length of some 2,000 km.When considering the study, it is important to note that it explicitly states that the network it outlines represents corridors and not routes.  The study does not indicate the specific routes that could be delivered along these broad corridors.  The study also specifically notes that the identified corridors are seen as providing a skeleton around which development of the national cycle network should occur.

The study highlights the particular benefits if such links make use of existing infrastructure.  It also provides a focus for the development of a national cycle network.Deputy Bannon has described what Longford has to offer in terms of amenities, sporting facilities, natural resources and scenic landscapes.  Smarter travel and sustainable transport are important.  Cycling routes have great potential for increasing mobility and accessibility and providing a real alternative to car journeys.  The most important aspect of the plan is that by 2020, in ten years time, the Minister for Transport — whom I quietly expect to be still in office then — will be able to say the 10% has been achieved.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I am informed by the Garda authorities that at present there are 68 staff in the Criminal Assets Bureau of whom 37 are members of An Garda Síochána. The budgetary allocation for 2010 for the Bureau is over €8m.  The Bureau is also staffed with Bureau Officers from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection as well as analysts, legal experts and technical and administrative support staff. The total staffing figure together with the corresponding budget for the years 2006 to 2009 are provided in the table which I am circulating with this answer.   There are also 128 asset profilers across all Garda Divisions who have been trained by CAB and assist them with early preparatory investigative work.The Deputy will be aware that the Bureau was established in 1996 and that its remit is to target the assets of persons who seek to derive profit from criminal activities. From its inception the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime, including drug trafficking.  CAB has been a central part of Ireland's response to the serious levels of organised crime that emerged in the 1990s.  It has been extremely successful in disrupting the activities of criminal gangs and in taking away their ill-gotten gains.  One of the important issues that it has addressed is that of tackling lower level criminality in a very visible way.  The apparent sudden accumulation of wealth by people without any visible means of support remains a priority issue for investigation by the Bureau.  The Bureau has already taken action in some cases which, although the level of assets have been relatively small, have nevertheless sent a very strong message to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. A strong focus on mid to low level criminality will continue to be a priority for CAB.The Government is fully committed to ensuring that the Criminal Assets Bureau is in a position to continue its excellent work in targeting the proceeds of all criminal activity.YearTotal Staff allocationNumber of GardaíTotal Budget Provision€million201068372010 allocation —

I am further informed that in respect of the incidents that occurred between 2008 to 2010 to date, a total of 21 cases are currently before the courts.  In addition a further 43 investigation files have been submitted to the DPP.The use of explosive devices and firearms by criminal gangs is a matter of ongoing concern both to me and to the Garda Authorities.  Garda strategies in counteracting these activities are very firmly focused on disrupting the criminal groups which are involved and, where sufficient evidence is available, proffering charges and bringing such persons before the Courts.  I have also put in place strong legislative measures to further strengthen the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 created the offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation with a penalty of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, increased the maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime from 5 years to 15 years imprisonment; protection of witnesses and juries from intimidation, provides for expert Garda opinion evidence on the existence and operations of criminal gangs to be admissible in evidence and provides for organised crime offences to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.Other significant legislation introduced to target organised crime includes the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.

Phase one, which is currently in progress,  comprises essential preliminary works to facilitate the prison development including the construction of a dedicated access road, the installation of off-site services and the construction of the perimeter wall of the prison.  The second phase of the project involves the provision of 400 cells along with related support facilities suitable to accommodate up to 700 prisoners. Subsequent phases of the project will see the provision of the balance of  the 1,000 cells thus providing  a total of 1,400 cells when completed with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners, thus future proofing the development.Access RoadI am pleased to advise the Deputy that a contract for the construction of the access road to serve the prison development was awarded to SIAC Construction Limited in July 2010 and construction work is already well underway in relation to this phase of the project. The access road and underpass are scheduled to be completed during February next year.Off-site WorksA procurement competition for the installation of the off-site services (e.g. sewerage, water mains, communications and technology ducting) to serve the prison development issued to companies on the Irish Prison Service Construction Framework in August. The closing date was 6 October 2010 and the evaluation of the tenders by the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisors has commenced . It is intended to award a contract in respect of the off-site works in November. The work will take approximately eight months to complete.Perimeter Security WallThe procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison is already in progress.  A pre-qualification competition from which suitably qualified contractors will be invited to tender for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison and related works issued on the E-Tenders web site in August 2010. The closing date for expressions of interest was 28 September 2010.  Twenty submissions were received and the evaluation of these submissions is already underway. A panel comprising 5 to 7 contractors will be established from this procurement competition and these contractors will be invited to tender for the construction of the perimeter security wall and ancillary works later this month. Construction of the perimeter wall is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and will take just under a year to complete.Prison BuildingsAs I mentioned previously in the House, my priority is to provide good quality, regime focussed prison accommodation at Thornton Hall prison campus as quickly as possible. A phased development of the prison campus is now being pursued. The next phase of the works will see the procurement of prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities commencing in the New Year using traditional procurement methods.  I cannot give a date for completion of work on the first phase but realistically speaking one could not expect the new facility to be available before 2014.In relation to expenditure on the project, the total expenditure to end September is €42.46 million.  This sum includes the site cost of €29.9 million. The cost of the site was almost completely offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin for €29 million. An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired at a cost of €1.3 million to provide a dedicated access route to the main prison site. This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the potential effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.This sum also includes €7.3 million expended on professional fees, €2.9 million on site preparation and various surveys, €0.5 million on landscaping and €0.5 million on security.  As is the case with all major infrastructure projects a comprehensive set of geological, engineering, archaeological and environmental surveys have been undertaken at the site in order to advance the construction programme for the development.  These surveys will enable the Irish Prison Service to accelerate the timeframe for the construction of the first phase of the prison buildings to a maximum of two years.

It also provides that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform shall issue guidelines in respect of the procedures to be followed with respect of the practical operation of the scheme following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Health and Children. I am pleased to say that the test purchasing scheme was broadly welcomed in this House during the discussions leading up to enactment of the legislation in 2008.The guidelines for the test purchasing scheme, which were recently launched by the Garda Commissioner and myself, were drawn up by a working group comprising representatives of the Gardaí, Office of the Minister for Children, Office of Tobacco Control and the Departments of Health and Children, and Justice and Law Reform. The primary concern of the group throughout the drafting process was to ensure the welfare of those involved in test purchasing operations. For this purpose, the group drew on test purchasing guidelines already in operation in England, and also had Northern Ireland's guidelines at its disposal. In addition, Garda representatives visited Liverpool during this period to observe test purchasing operations on the ground as well as the training and other safeguards put in place to safeguard the welfare of those involved in test purchasing operations.I am satisfied therefore that the welfare of those involved has been taken fully into account in drafting the guidelines for the test purchasing scheme. The guidelines will ensure that their welfare will underpin each stage of test purchasing operations.

This priority is reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for this year, which sets out a commitment to proactively target groups and individuals engaged in organised crime.  To this end, An Garda Síochána is conducting intelligence-led operations focusing on organised crime groups in the greater Dublin area and in other cities.  As a result of these operations, a number of individuals are before the courts charged with serious offences concerning the sale and supply of arms.  There operations include Operation Anvil.  Since its commencement, over 1,400 firearms have been recovered in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and 1,800 outside it.An Garda Síochána is utilising all available legislation in respect of tackling organised crime.  The force will continue to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations which prevent such crimes by early intervention.An Garda Síochána is committed to tackling the illegal importation of firearms.  Inter-agency co-operation is essential to this, and the Garda Organised Crime Unit maintains liaison with the PSNI and the UK Serious and Organised Crime Agency.  An Garda Síochána also has liaison officers based in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal and officers seconded to Europol and Interpol.  There is also strong inter-agency co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service.  As a result of this co-operation, Irish and international figures are being successfully targeted.There are very severe penalties for firearms offences in place.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced a wide range of provisions to combat gun crime.  It introduced mandatory minimum sentences of five or ten years for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, use of a firearm to resist arrest and a new offence of altering a firearm.

The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party — a pimp, for example. The Act also provides for offences such as organising prostitution, coercing or compelling a person to be a prostitute, knowingly living on the earnings of a prostitute, or keeping or managing a brothel.  In addition, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 makes it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.Currently under the criminal law in Ireland, it is not an offence, in itself, to sell sex. In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either.  The matter is currently being examined. Any proposal to amend the law in terms of criminalising the purchase of sex would require very careful consideration.  During the Summer, the Swedish Government completed an evaluation of its 1999 legislation criminalising the purchase of sex. Sweden was the first country in the world to introduce such legislation and, more recently, Norway and Iceland have introduced similar bans.The Dignity Project recently arranged a visit to Sweden to learn more about the evaluation and the delegation included representation from my Department. Dignity is an EU funded research project examining services provided to victims of human trafficking, with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries, and is led by the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  My Department's Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and the Garda National Immigration Bureau are partners with observer status.  It is an inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional initiative with partners in Scotland, Spain and Lithuania. The visit to Stockholm took place from 14 to 16 September and my officials are preparing a report of the visit, including an assessment of the Swedish legislative provisions. I will examine the report in due course.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	435	As the C&AG report acknowledges, increased civilian support for the Garda Síochána does not exclusively take the form of one-for-one replacement of individual Gardaí by civilian staff. Of course, in some instances, civilianisation does indeed enable the direct replacement of Gardaí who are engaged in exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties by civilian staff. In a great many other cases, however, it allows Gardaí who would otherwise have to devote a substantial part of their working day to performing administrative duties to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties.  Civilian staff may also be recruited to perform new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in the Garda Síochána, for example as crime analysts or IT specialists.This in itself can indirectly free up Gardaí for operational duty.  The report notes the estimate that the recently established Garda Information Services Centre in Castlebar, which is staffed by civilians, has freed up as many as 265 Gardaí on a daily basis, as they no longer have to personally input details of incidents onto PULSE.  It is also the case that some of the additional civilian staff, for example those allocated to the expanded Garda Central Vetting Unit in Thurles, are performing a vital role which would otherwise have had to be undertaken by Gardaí redeployed from operational duty.  This also needs to be factored into any calculations.Of course I want to see the maximum number of Gardaí allocated to frontline operational duties, and I know that the Commissioner fully shares this objective.  Indeed the whole time equivalent number of civilians in An Garda Síochána has increased from 1,688 at the end of 2007 to over 2,100 at the present time. Every opportunity to make further progress on this, whether through building on recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate or the use of redeployment under the Public Service Agreement, will be vigorously pursued.

The situation is continually kept under review in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and derogations can be sought in exceptional circumstances from the Minister for Finance.  I received sanction from the Minister for Finance for the filling of approximately 170 vacancies in An Garda Síochána including consequential vacancies. All of these promotions have now taken place and I am pleased to say that consequential promotions at all ranks to Sergeant level have also taken place. This brings to approximately 280 the number of promotions that have taken place in An Garda Síochána so far this year. As I have stated, the situation will be kept under close review on an ongoing basis.

This figure includes 400 probationer Gardaí who have been attested and will graduate over the next six months.  On that date there were also 9 unattested students in training. In relation to retirements, 236 members of the Force have so far either left the force or declared their intention to retire during 2010.An Garda Síochána is of course subject to the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service and the purpose of the present Garda recruitment campaign is to establish a panel of approved candidates who will be available to meet Garda recruitment needs in the future.  Applicants who are currently on a panel and have gone through the medical, physical and character vetting procedures, and are available, will be offered positions as Garda Trainees, in strict order of where they were placed on the panel, upon the resumption of recruitment.

I have been informed by the Commissioner that a range of interpretation services is available to the Force in accordance with contracts that have been put in place.  These services operate where persons have been detained and in other circumstances, as required, and the Commissioner has reported that the current interpretation arrangements are working well.  The Garda authorities have structured their contracts to ensure that persons carrying out interpretation work will be qualified to a high level.  The Commissioner is aware that as things currently stand there are no national standards for the provision of interpretation services and he has indicated that he would support the adoption of such standards.

These Divisional resources are augmented by relevant Garda national units as and when deemed necessary.For operational reasons it is not the practice to comment on specific anti-terrorism measures relating to the security of the State. However, intelligence-led operations by An Garda Síochána, targeting the activities of dissident republican groups, continue to be given priority, commensurate with the threat posed, which is closely monitored in consultation with other law enforcement agencies. Such operations involve strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda Units.  Close cooperation exists at all levels between An Garda Síochána and their PSNI counterparts in the context of countering and investigating the activities of such groups.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I understand from the Garda Commissioner that, in the course of preparing a comprehensive investigation file into the criminal activities of an organised criminal group for consideration by the DPP, a small but nonetheless important portion of the investigation file was brought under Garda supervision to the premises in question.  During the course of the Garda visit to the premises, and while a designated member of staff was dealing with the printing request, members of An Garda Síochána became aware that this person communicated with a third party without the consent of An Garda Síochána.  The Garda members present on the premises took immediate action to eliminate any risk of further exposure of this portion of the Garda investigation file.The involvement of the designated member of staff with the third party in this matter is the subject of a continuing Garda investigation, and it would be inappropriate to comment further on this at this time.  While the Commissioner is satisfied that the members of An Garda Síochána concerned acted in good faith in this matter, he is taking all steps necessary to avoid any recurrence of such an incident, including the issuing of a Garda Headquarters Directive instructing members on the appropriate measures to be taken in compiling investigation files.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 50 together.I launched the review of gambling in May of last year.  The Casino Gaming Control Section of my Department was established from within the existing resources of my Department at that time to manage the review process.  This Section also deals with all matters arising from my Department's current responsibility for the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 2003.  The objective of the wide-ranging review is to provide Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing the gambling architecture in the State.  Consultation was and continues to be an essential part of the review process.  Written submissions were requested with a deadline for receipt of 30 September 2009, though the review team does not ignore submissions received, even at this late stage.I was pleased that over 70 organisations and groups considered the topic important enough to submit written submissions, and that many followed up those submissions with face-to-face meetings with the review team.  I have also indicated that I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval of policy proposals for a new gambling architecture in the State, following an evaluation of the material received.  The policy proposals, which I would intend to publish, will be based on an examination of the submissions received, as well as the recommendations contained in the Report of the Casino Committee, Regulating Gaming in Ireland,  and, of course, consideration of modern gambling regulation.  The review team is currently engaged in developing the appropriate proposals for consideration.It is a matter of record that Governments of different hues have shied away from attempting any significant reform of our gambling laws since our existing gaming and lotteries legislation was enacted over 50 years ago.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, I am resolved to make our gambling laws relevant to the 21st century.  In light of this commitment, I make no apology for taking the time to make sure this is done effectively. We must first achieve a policy in relation to a new gambling architecture that is capable of broad spectrum agreement and it is when this goal is achieved that we will be in a position to address the matter of legislative change, with some degree of confidence.Any such new policy aimed at modernising our gambling code must take account of the challenges and threats, but also opportunities, presented by new technologies, particularly the internet.  In addition, policy must also be premised on the three important considerations which are the hallmark of most well-regulated gambling codes.  These are:that young people and the vulnerable are protectedthat gambling should in all respects be fairly and openly  conducted andthat gambling is kept free of crime.Following the settling of that policy, arrangements will be made in the normal course to address the necessary legislative change. As the first comprehensive review of our gambling law, effectively since the enactment of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 draws to a close, it is reasonable to expect that any new legislation that may arise, will be both complex and comprehensive.

Essentially, this is a dedicated corps of staff whose task is to escort prisoners to and from court in new cellular vehicles, thus eliminating the need to resort to overtime working as had been the practice heretofore.During 2008 preliminary discussions were held between the Irish Prison Service and An Garda Síochána in relation to the potential for the PSEC to undertake some escorts that are currently being carried out by An Garda Síochána; specifically the escorting of remand prisoners. These discussions identified that there would be a necessary increase in Irish Prison Service staffing levels to allow it to undertake this work. The IPS were not at that time in a position to put the necessary additional staffing in place, and in September 2008 informed An Garda Síochána of that position. The IPS has, however, since the opening of the new Criminal Courts Complex in Dublin taken responsibility for some escorts that were previously carried out by An Garda Síochána.In the context of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 my Department has been examining the potential for the delivery of efficiencies through greater cooperation and interaction between elements of the criminal justice system and issues such as this will be considered in that context.  The following tables show the number of hours expended by Garda and civilian personnel in performing duties relating to the transportation of remand prisoners to / from Court by An Garda Síochána for 2009 and 2010 (to roster ending 19th September, 2010)Rostered HrsOvertime HrsTotalGarda1,7841,3773,161Civilian6,5524,25010,802Total8,3365,62713,963Rostered HrsOvertime HrsTotalGarda1,2047201,924Civilian6,5283,97710,505Total7,7324,69812,430
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The Annual Report on the Garda Diversion Programme for 2009 indicates that there was a reduction of 13% in the number of incidents referred to the programme, and a reduction of 14% in the number of children referred to it, during that period. As regards alcohol-related offences, there was a reduction of 22% in the number of such offences compared with 2008. This suggests that the Government's approach to tackling alcohol-related offences, and associated anti-social behaviour, is proving effective and I want to congratulate the Gardaí for their work in this area.The sale of alcohol products to underage persons is already prohibited under licensing law. It is an offence under section 31(2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 for a license holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years. This applies equally to premises with off-licences, including supermarkets, convenience stores and similar outlets, and those with on-licences such as public houses. The penalties for selling or delivering alcohol products to under-18s, originally set out in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, were substantially increased in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between 2 and 7 days will be imposed, together with a fine of up to €3,000. The penalties for a second, or subsequent, offence is a closure order of between 7 and 30 days, and a fine of up to €5,000. In addition, the licensee is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 also provided the Gardaí with significant additional powers to address the problem of alcohol sales to underage persons. Section 14 contains provisions which allow a Garda who believes with reasonable cause that such a person possesses a bottle or other container containing intoxicating liquor which is being, or is intended to be, consumed by him or her to seize and remove the container.  Section 14 of the 2008 Act also makes provision for the test purchasing of alcohol products. The primary objective of the scheme, which entered into force on 1 October, is to enable the Gardaí to target those licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales to young people. This scheme will provide them with an additional instrument in their overall enforcement programme.As regards additional measures to combat home deliveries of alcohol products to underage persons, I have already announced my intention to make it an explicit offence in the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill for a third party, e.g. courier or taxi, to deliver alcohol to an underage person. I am also considering the possibility of introducing of a ‘test delivery' scheme to complement the test purchasing scheme. It would cover both home deliveries to under 18s, and also deliveries to any person where, contrary to the law, payment for the alcohol product is accepted on delivery.As regards the labelling of alcohol containers, section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 already provides for the making of regulations to specify particulars to be displayed on containers which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified. However during consultations between my Department and the Attorney General's Office on implementation of section 22, the Attorney General's office expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container by an under-18 year old. For example, the container might have been taken from the home by the underage person, or legally sold to a person over 18 years and passed on to the underage person. This has cast serious doubt on the benefits to be gained from any regulations that might be made under the 2003 Act.

It is not possible without manually examining each and every case to provide information on the exact length of sentence being served or the date that each person went at large, however, the overwhelming majority of persons were nearing the end of their sentences.  The Gardaí are informed where prisoners are unlawfully at large and have the power to detain, arrest and return such persons to prison. I can also advise the Deputy that ongoing contact takes place between the Gardaí and the Prison Service in relation to persons at large.Four hundred and nine prisoners were classified as being at large at a date during this year. Additionally,135 prisoners currently classified at large date from 2009, 40 date from 2008 and six date from 2007. Experience has shown that most offenders who go at large do not remain so for very long and it is not therefore surprising that the majority of persons on this list went at large in the not too distant past. A breakdown of the offences concerned is appended below.Legislation granting temporary release to a person detained in an institution is provided for in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as substituted by section 1 of the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 and as amended by section 110 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. This legislation grants the Minister for Justice and Law Reform the power to make rules for the temporary release of persons serving a sentence of imprisonment and these regulations are currently set out in the Prisoners (Temporary Release) Rules 2004 (S.I. No. 680 of 2004).Where a person serving a custodial sentence has been granted temporary release, that person is entitled to be at liberty, so long as they comply with the conditions of their temporary release. Section 6(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 sets out the circumstances in which a person on temporary release may be regarded as a person unlawfully-at-large. The Act also provides that a breach of a condition automatically terminates temporary release and thereafter the person is deemed to be unlawfully-at-large.  Section 7 of the 1960 Act provides that such a person unlawfully-at-large may be arrested without warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána where that member suspects the person to be unlawfully-at-large, and that member may take such person to the place in which he is required in accordance with law to be detained.The offence breakdown is set out in the following table:Offence CategoryTotalTheft and Related Offences161Public Order and other Social Code Offences58Controlled Drug Offences54Attempts/Threats to Murder, Assaults, Harassments and related offences50Burglary and Related Offences44Other Road and Traffic Offences47Dangerous or Negligent Acts41Offences against Government, Justice Procedures and Organisation of Crime32Damage to Property and to the Environment28Weapons and Explosives Offences31Fraud, Deception and Related Offences27Offences Not Elsewhere Classified13Robbery, Extortion and hijacking offences2Homicide Offences (both are death by dangerous driving)2Sexual Offences0Kidnapping and Related Offences0

Louth.  The genesis of this meeting lies in discussions in bilateral meetings I had previously held with both Ministers.  I met with Mr. MacAskill in April 2010, to build on contact at official level and with a view to discussing areas of common interest and exploring the exchange of policy ideas and best practice.  I have met regularly with Mr. Ford since his appointment, both under the aegis of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation on Criminal Justice Matters and informally, to discuss matters of cooperation and common interest in the justice and policing spheres.  Most recently, we opened and addressed the Cross Border Organised Crime Seminar which was held in Belfast at the start of this week.Given the similar issues faced by our three jurisdictions and the cultural similarities and historical ties between Scotland and Ireland as a whole, I was convinced we could benefit from meeting together, particularly in the context of ensuring closer cooperation in meeting the challenges posed by organised crime in particular.  At the meeting we discussed, inter alia, human trafficking, organised crime, forensic science, DNA legislation and police training.In relation to human trafficking I outlined the measures being taken in this jurisdiction, including the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and the provisions contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  We discussed the possibility of including human trafficking as a discrete area of co-operation under the Intergovernmental Agreement, and committed to building on current links with the Scottish Government in this area.  Minister Ford and I discussed plans to develop a Memorandum of Understanding between our Forensic Science Laboratory and Forensic Science Northern Ireland to provide for mutual support in the event of sudden loss or damage to facilities.In the context of the introduction of our own DNA Bill, Cabinet Secretary MacAskill outlined the Scottish regime with regard to the retention of DNA samples, which was recently praised by the European Court of Human Rights.  On police training, we already have excellent cooperation with the PSNI, including under the provisions of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Police Cooperation.  Since my meeting with Mr. MacAskill earlier this year, invitations have been extended to senior Scottish police officers to participate on the Executive Leadership training course at Templemore, and I expect at least one Scottish participant on the course in the coming months.Regarding initiatives to reduce offending, I briefed the meeting on the White Paper on Crime process which is currently being undertaken.  Cabinet Secretary MacAskill and Minister Ford shared details of recent developments in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  There was also a discussion relating to the threat posed by paramilitary groups.  Overall, it was very useful to meet with Mr. Ford and Mr. MacAskill together and it is a relationship that I intend to pursue for the benefit of all the people of Ireland and Scotland.

The Tribunal was established by resolutions passed by the Oireachtas in March 2005. The Tribunal is chaired by His Honour Mr. Justice  Peter Smithwick.The Deputy will be aware that the Tribunal Chairman is independent in his functions in accordance with the provisions of the Acts.  The terms of the Resolutions of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and the Instrument establishing the Tribunal provide for the submission of interim reports to the Clerk of the Dáil within ten days of the commencement of oral hearings regarding the granting of representation before the Tribunal, progress to date, likely duration and any other matters which the Tribunal considers appropriate. I am informed that the Tribunal is in an investigative phase at present. Public hearings will take place once that phase is completed.As to whether the Tribunal has secured all the co-operation it requires, that is a matter for the Tribunal itself and will, I have no doubt, be addressed by it in the final report.  In any event the resolutions passed by the Houses permit the Chairman to write to the Clerk of the Dáil if he believes that he is not receiving full co-operation.

The abduction and false imprisonment of a person's family or friends, in order to coerce them into assisting with a robbery is a particularly abhorrent type of crime.  The trauma visited on the innocent victims involved by heartless criminals can only be imagined by the rest of us.  I know my contempt for those responsible will be shared by members of this House and by the wider public.It is the policy of An Garda Síochána not to disclose the amount of money taken during such crimes.  There are agreed response procedures in place for dealing with such incidents.  Regular meetings are held between An Garda Síochána and financial institutions to discuss bank security issues and in particular kidnap prevention and response protocols.  Clearly it is incumbent upon the banks and financial institutions to do everything possible to prevent these robberies.  That means that the protocols must be followed and systems put in place to ensure that, for example, it is not possible for employees who have been placed under terrible duress to be in a position to access large amounts of cash.  When the protocols are followed the Gardaí are given a great advantage in their efforts to foil these crimes and arrest those responsible.  That has been proven to be the case.I want to assure the House that the Gardaí are totally focused in combating this form of criminality as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs.  New legislation has been put in place to provide for covert surveillance evidence to be used in Court.  I have also introduced legislation which specifically targets the organised criminal gangs responsible for these reprehensible crimes.   The Deputy will appreciate that bank charges and fees are not primarily a matter under my control as Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  I have in any case made it clear that I am not proposing that additional costs should be imposed on the consumer.  I am of the view that we should examine the current levels of cash in circulation within the economy.  This is a matter that has been raised with me including by bank staff representatives.To date in 2010 five so-called ‘tiger' kidnappings have taken place and the following table shows the number of similar incidents recorded between 2005-2009.YearNo. of incidents recorded*2009620081200712006420051*The total number of incidents in 2006 and 2007, namely 5, is the same as that I provided in reply to Question No. 172 of 30 June 2010. However, the Garda authorities advise that the figures in question fall to be revised to 4 and 1 respectively, not 2 and 3 which was in the earlier reply.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The Government Legislation Programme, published on 29 September 2010, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill will be published in this Session. The Bill will reform the law on mental capacity taking into account the Law Reform Commission's Report on Vulnerable Adults and the Law. It is intended that the Bill will replace the Wards of Court system   with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	451	The Probation Service of my Department is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.  In common with the rest of the Civil Service the Probation Service is subject to the Government's moratorium on recruitment and promotion and its staff also have access to the Incentivised Career Break Scheme and the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement. Where vacancies do arise, the Probation Service is required to further prioritise its workload.  When the Probation Service was restructured five years ago, increased emphasis was placed on working with higher risk offenders and juvenile offenders and in developing the Community Service system as an effective alternative to custody.  These remain the priority areas for the Probation Service.As the Deputy may know currently the most common non-custodial sanction used by the Courts is the imposition of a fine.  Indeed, the recently enacted Fines Act, 2010 makes provision for the use of non-custodial options for the non-payment of fines such as Community Service in less serious cases.  I am glad to tell the Deputy that my Department recently obtained Department of Finance sanction for recruitment to a number of priority, frontline posts in the Probation Service, by way of exceptions to the current Moratorium.  This involves the recruitment of 8 Probation Officers and 3 Community Service Supervisors and follows on from the recent filling of 2 posts at Senior Probation Officer level.  This current investment of staffing resources into the Probation Service is further evidence of the priority being given to the delivery of core frontline services.  My Department and Probation Service management are keeping the situation under constant review to ensure that the resources at the disposal of the Service are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible.More generally, in addition to the significant staffing levels working within the Probation Service, my Department provides funding — amounting to 31% of the total Probation budget for 2010 — to approximately 50 voluntary bodies to add value to the core work of the Service and to assist with the management of offenders in the community.Turning to the issue of juveniles, tackling youth crime is a key priority for this Government. The Government's policy on youth crime is set out in detail in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010. This strategy is underpinned by the principles of the Children Act 2001, as amended. The approach adopted by the Government involves the deployment of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, Community Gardaí and the use of measures such as the Garda Diversion Programme, Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects, community sanctions and the incremental process of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders, all of which attempt to confront youth crime and related behaviours in an incremental way, with detention as a last resort.  I am not in a position to give an indication as to a possible increase in the level of investment in 2011 in diversion and community sanctions until the 2011 Estimates process has been completed.With regard to the issue of anti-social behaviour, the Deputy will be aware that Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.With regard to adults, these include a behaviour warning and the making of a civil order by the Court. With regard to children, they range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to 30 September, 2010, 2,208 behaviour warnings have been issued to adults and 1,476 to children. Fifteen good behaviour contracts have been issued to children. Four civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the Courts.  In setting up the regime the intention was that interventions short of a Court Order would address the problem behaviour. If they succeed, there will be no need to apply to the Courts. It is only if they fail to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a Court Order will be applied for.  Given the small number of Court Orders which have been finalised (seven in all) compared to the number of warnings given, it would appear that this is in fact happening and that the Gardaí are exercising their powers under the legislation pragmatically and the option of a Court Order is very much a last resort.I should also add that the most recently published Discussion Document of the White Paper on Crime series, ‘Criminal Sanctions', included an examination of the use of non-custodial sanctions generally.   Submissions on this Document were invited and in August 2010 my Department published reports of both the submissions received and a consultation seminar held in Dublin Castle on the 28 May 2010.  The opinions received will all feed into the development of future policy in this field.

Subsequent to that reply, my officials have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that should the law need to be changed consequent on any advices received, to ensure an appropriate level of enforcement or control of gaming, I will not hesitate to do so as part of the outcome of the review of gambling currently underway.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	453	The granting of sentence remission is a feature of many prison systems worldwide and has been a feature of the Irish criminal justice system since the foundation of the State.  Indeed our Courts are aware of the statutory entitlement to remission when passing sentence.  Section 35 of the Prisons Act, 2007 (No. 10  of 2007) provides that the Minister may make rules for the regulation and good government of prisons and such rules may provide for the remission of a portion of a prisoner's sentence. New Prison Rules (S.I. No. 252 of 2007) ,effective from 1st October, 2007, specifically deal with the matter of remission at Rule 59.Prisoners sentenced to imprisonment (other than the categories listed below) are entitled by law to remission of one quarter of sentence provided they are of good behaviour during their time in custody.There are a number of categories of prisoner who are excluded from standard remission of sentence under the Prison Rules and these are as follows:Life sentence prisoners;Persons convicted of debtor offences;Persons convicted of contempt of court;Persons being held on remand warrants; andPersons serving a sentence of less than one month.I should also add that European Court of Human Rights has held that a loss of remission requires a specific finding of a breach of prison discipline.  In practice therefore, a prisoner will normally get 25% remission unless they have breached prison discipline and a sanction of loss of remission has been imposed.As stated already remission and conditional release are a common feature of prison systems throughout Western Europe. Remission rates can vary between 25% and 50%.   For example, in the Netherlands prisoners are entitled to automatic remission of one third of their sentence.  The UK also used to provide automatic remission of one third but their system was changed in 2006 to a system of conditional release after 50% of the sentence was served.  There would be constitutional issues in trying to introduce any new system which would reduce the amount of remission for prisoners who have already been sentenced.In relation to interventions specifically aimed at the cohort of prisoner serving sentences relating to sexual offences I would like to tell the Deputy about a new programme of group interventions for such  offenders which was introduced  in the Irish Prison Service in January 2009. The programme, "Building Better Lives", allows more responsive and flexible delivery to a greater number of offenders than heretofore. The new treatment programme will ensure that all sex offenders serving sentences of one year or more will have access to appropriate treatment.  This new programme replaced the Sex Offender Programme which ran from 1994 to 2008. There is a comprehensive range of services available to sex offenders and any willing participant can be facilitated within the range of therapeutic interventions. These comprise notably one-to-one interventions, group interventions, community-based services and interventions available to prisoners generally. Therapeutic interventions with sex offenders are delivered primarily through the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service.Research indicates that there is no evidence to support the idea that mandatory attendance, or indeed attendance achieved under threat of punishment, at rehabilitation programmes was of any value in reducing re-offending. Incentives to encourage voluntary participation offer a greater chance of success.  On the contrary all indications are that rehabilitation does not work unless the offender is motivated to engage with the process.  The successful completion of any group treatment course depends critically on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals.  Otherwise, the elements of the programme concerned with challenging the offender to take responsibility for his offending behaviour will not succeed.  I will continue to keep under review what measures (including remission) are appropriate to maintain effective participation rates in therapeutic programmes by sex offenders.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The number of offences being committed by persons on bail is a matter of concern. The operation of the legislation relating to bail is kept under continuing review by my Department, and proposals for amendment of the legislation are brought forward when that is considered necessary.  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.The statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office indicate that in 2009 there was a reduction of 7% in the number of offences recorded where the suspected offender was on bail, compared with the previous year.  Towards the end of last year, I obtained Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill.  The Bill will restate and consolidate bail law.  In addition, a number of matters to improve the operation of the law are being examined.  These include:(a) providing that the courts must have regard to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person or the public posed by the release of the accused person on bail;(b) creating presumptions that bail should be refused for people charged with certain types of serious crime.  In view of restrictions resulting from the European Convention on Human Rights, such presumptions would act as a form of guidance to the courts in identifying those who present unacceptable risks of committing serious offences if granted bail; and(c) extending the powers of the courts to refuse bail where that is necessary to prevent the commission of further offences to include more minor offences which fall below the current level of seriousness required by the Bail Act 1997.I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government before the end of this year.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	455	All cases of murder where proceedings have not yet been taken remain under active investigation.  The detection rate by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the law officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore, such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.While An Garda Síochána has made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, the reality is that there can be considerable difficulties in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities from associates of a victim of a gangland killing, or indeed from gangland figures even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.  Against that background, I am informed by the Garda authorities that of the 203 murders involving a firearm recorded during the period 1 January, 1998 to 3 October, 2010, the most recent date for which figures are available, proceedings have commenced in 61 cases and 25 convictions secured.  Figures are operational and liable to change.I am, of course, deeply concerned about the incidence of gun murders and I deplore all such killings.  All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda Síochána in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is also reflected in the Garda policing plan for this year, and specific initiatives, including under Operation Anvil and involving members of the Emergency Response Unit, have been put in place.I am informed by the Garda authorities that multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where National Units — the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau — are used to combat serious crime, including gangland crime.  These units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section which assists with intelligence briefings and timely information.  This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a coordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.  These specific initiatives are in addition to the activities of all members of An Garda Síochána in implementing and enforcing the criminal law.It was in that overall context that I introduced greatly strengthened legislation in the area of organised crime which is being fully utilised by An Garda Síochána, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Criminal Procedure Act 2010.  I have introduced further significant legislative proposals in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, and I will not hesitate to introduce additional measures if that becomes necessary.   In addition, I have secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.There are very severe penalties for firearms offices in place under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For example, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and using a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape carry a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Possessing a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, possessing a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, carrying a firearm with criminal intent and altering a firearm all carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.

Following a sentence management review in mid 2009, the prisoner in question was deemed suitable for a transfer to an open centre and was transferred to Shelton Abbey on 5 September 2009.I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that he absconded from Shelton Abbey on 11 October, 2009 and that he remains unlawfully at large. Gardaí were notified of his status by the prison staff on the same date.  I am also advised that at no stage was the prisoner in question granted temporary release during this sentence.  Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 provides that a person unlawfully-at-large may be arrested without warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána where that member suspects the person to be unlawfully-at-large. The Act also provides that the member may take such a person to the place in which he is required in accordance with law to be detained. Every effort is made by members of An Garda Síochána to return all such persons to custody.

The report contains eighty-four recommendations made by the Inspectorate.  To date, seventy-four of these have been fully implemented, a further seven have been partially implemented and further progress remains to be made in relation to three.  These three remaining recommendations relate to the need for a formal arrangement for the provision of professional mental health advice and support to the Garda Síochána at barricade incidents. This is one of a number of issues currently being considered by a high level Cross-Sectoral Working Group, chaired jointly by my Department and the Department of Health & Children.  This Working Group includes representatives from An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive. In the meantime, the Central Mental Hospital continues to provide the Garda Síochána with specialist medical support in critical incidents.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Joint Policing Committees are provided for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  Their purpose is to provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and the local authority — the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area — can come together, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting their area.On 24 September, 2008, I launched, with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, guidelines for the Committees, which took into account the experience gained during a pilot phase and which provided for the establishment of Committees in all 114 local authority areas by the relevant local authority and the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that 110 Committees have been established to date.  I attach great importance to the work of the Committees and believe that they are playing a constructive role in providing a collaborative approach to preventing and tackling crime at the local level and facilitating appropriate and relevant responses to local issues.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	459	A number of the measures in the Special Group Report (McCarthy) have been implemented at this stage in order to achieve reductions in the Departments Estimates for 2010. These relate to the programmes in a range of subheads which include Gender Mainstreaming, Graffiti Removal Operations, Equality Monitoring Consultative Committees, European Refugee Fund and Refugee Integration. The McCarthy Report recommended a total reduction of some €5 million in respect of these particular items. The actual budgetary reduction was €6.92 million. I should add that some of these areas are under the responsibility of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs since June, this year.A significant proportion of the recommendations (€84 million) related to reductions in payroll costs on items such as allowances payable to members of the Garda Síochána and the Prisons Service.  In common with all Departments, there are significant reductions in payroll related provisions in 2010 to take account of the reductions in payroll rates and other factors. The overall reduction in gross payroll budgets for the Justice Sector compared with the 2009 estimate is in the region of €126 million. A number of recommendations were made by the McCarthy Group on structural reform and rationalisation across the Justice and Equality Sector. Decisions in respect of a number of these recommendations will be a matter for decision by Government in due course.In other cases progress is being made on measures such as the reduction of staffing in the Children's Detention Schools under the ambit of the Irish Youth Justice Service. Any expenditure reductions arising will be reflected in the budget for the Sector in future years as appropriate. A number of the recommendations in this context refer to the Equality, Disability, Integration and Human Rights areas, which are now the responsibility of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.While it was never the intention that the full €134 million reduction recommended in the McCarthy report would be delivered in 2010, significant progress in this regard has been made. This is through a combination of the recommendations in the report and other measures being taken as part of the Government's budgetary policy.

It is important to point out that tackling youth crime is a key priority for this Government. The Government's policy on youth crime is set out in detail in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010. This strategy is underpinned by the principles of the Children Act 2001, as amended. The approach adopted by the Government involves the deployment of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers and the use of measures such as the Garda Diversion Programme, Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects, community sanctions and the incremental process of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders, all of which attempt to confront youth crime and related behaviours in an incremental way, with detention as a last resort.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I assume that the Deputy is referring to recommendation number 10.7 contained in the Report of the Innovation Taskforce that provides for modernisation of bankruptcy law.  The Deputy will appreciate that the recommendation envisages that any such modernisation should follow the conclusion of the Law Reform Commission's consultation process on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will give early attention to consideration of the detail of the Final Report of the Law Reform Commission on the subject of modernisation of bankruptcy when it becomes available in the near future.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there are two categories of organised crime groups operating within this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures, and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.  Membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual's membership of such gangs.  The identification of offenders as members of a criminal gang is generally not an essential criterion in the prosecution of offences.  It is not therefore possible to ascertain the precise number of criminals or criminal gangs operating in this country at a particular given time.As the Deputy is aware, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 entered into force, in its entirety, on 23 July 2009.  The primary purpose of the legislation is to make additional measures available to An Garda Síochána to combat organised crime.  The Act introduced an amended offence relating to participation or involvement in organised crime with a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment.  Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crimes. To date, the Act has been used on eighty-three occasions where arrests have been made in relation to organised crime. Eight individuals have been charged under the legislation. Many of the other arrests have also resulted in charges being preferred for other offences such as firearms offences, drug trafficking, violent disorder, theft, aggravated burglary etc.Members of An Garda Síochána are utilising all available legislation relating to organised crime. An Garda Síochána will continue to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of such crimes.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I can advise the Deputy that the number of such persons actually held in custody at any one time is a minute fraction of the overall prisoner population. To illustrate this point, 14 prisoners out of a total of 4.366 or 0.3 % of the prison population on 05 October 2010 fell into this category. On the same date there was 1 person in custody for failing to pay a civil debt.As the Deputy will be aware, the Fines Act 2010 was signed into law at the end of May this year. It provides for an innovative, balanced and more humane approach to the determination and collection of fines. Capacity to pay, equality of impact and payment by instalment are key features of the legislation. The Act addresses the issue of capacity to pay by requiring the court to examine the financial circumstances of the person before determining the amount of the fine.  The person on whom the fine has been imposed will be entitled to make an application to the court to pay by instalments.The Act also provides for alternatives to imprisonment in the event of non-payment of a fine. In such circumstances, a recovery order can be activated and a receiver will be entitled to recover the fine or to seize and sell property from the person and recover the fine from the proceeds. A community service order is also an option.  Imprisonment in the event of default will be a last resort.

The importation of firearms is strictly governed by legislation. In particular, pursuant to the Firearms (Firearms Certificates for Non-Residents) Act 2000, the Minister is empowered to grant firearms certificates to non-residents who apply for a firearms certificate for purposes other than hunting or sporting purposes.  Any decision to grant a firearms certificate is made in consultation with the Garda Síochána, which at all times retains responsibility for law enforcement matters generally and in relation to visiting VIPs.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Proposals for the introduction of a new system which would allow the taking of contemporaneous written notes to cease where interviews are electronically recorded have been considered by my Department and the Garda Síochána, in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General.  While proposals for a new system are well advanced, it is not a straight-forward matter and there are a number of legal, technological, training and financial issues to be addressed before any changeover to a new system can take place.Accordingly, the matter is one of a number of issues now being considered by the Advisory Committee on Garda Interviewing which I established earlier this Summer.  This Committee, Chaired by the Honourable Mr Justice Esmond Smyth, was established, following the recommendations of the Morris Tribunal, to oversee policy on interviews in Garda custody and to ensure that the law and systems of interviewing are kept under continual review.  I will give very careful consideration to the views of the Committee on this matter.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The report of the Working Group on transparency in commercial rent reviews was published on 17 August.  It is available on my Department's website — www.justice.ie.  The Working Group recommended the establishment of a public database containing relevant details of letting arrangements and rent reviews in the commercial property market.   An appropriate amendment is being developed within the Department for inclusion in the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 which would see the Property Services Regulatory Authority being given responsibility for the management of the database.  The precise operational details pertaining to the database have yet to be finalised.Also amongst the recommendations is the adoption, by landlords and tenants alike, of the rent review arbitration code which is appended to the report and which is intended to achieve a uniform and transparent procedure for the resolution of disputes in the sector.  The Group which I established had representatives from all of the key stakeholders in the commercial property market.   They have all signed up to the Report and I am confident that there is a willingness to implement its recommendations.The Group has also made a number of ancillary recommendations which are largely intended to point parties in the direction of good practice.   For example, it is recommended that rent reviews take place as close to the review date as is possible to avoid any unnecessary lag between the market conditions prevailing at that date and those at the time the review actually takes place.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I should say at the outset that my Department has not withdrawn funding from the organisation which provides services to victims of crime in respect of court support services.  I understand that since its inception in 2005 the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime has provided grant assistance to the Court Support Services Organisation.  The Commission continues to fund the Court Support Services in 2010. The Commission is an independent body operating under the aegis of my Department.I am advised that the Commission has expended considerable time and energy over a number of years in relation to significant governance issues in the Court Support Services. Since June, 2009 the board of the Court Support Services has actively worked to resolve these issues. An independent report on developing effective governance and management for the Court Support Services in summer, 2010 found the governance structures inadequate and recommended that a range of measures needed to be implemented.In relation to the subject matter of the current question, I am advised that the Board of the Court Support Services is replacing a system of unvouched expenses for volunteers with a system supported by receipts. The independent report mentioned above recommended such a system.  I understand that the Board of the Court Support Services is actively seeking to implement all of the recommendations of the independent report, so that the Court Support Services can become a sustainable organisation with the ability to deliver top class services to victims of crime. The Board is about to recruit a new manager for the service.Existing nationwide court accompaniment services for victims of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault and Dublin-based services for those under eighteen years of age continue to operate at full capacity. A court accompaniment service in the Central Criminal Court is being provided this week by the Court Support Services and other highly experienced volunteers.  It is my considered view that all of the organisations funded by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime must aim to achieve the highest standard of service for victims of crime.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	468	It is important to put our increasing prisoner population in context and within the management of this population to look at the role that temporary release can play. Indeed Ireland is not unique in having to manage an increasing prisoner population — a fact acknowledged by the Inspector of Prisons in his commentary on this issue.  It is evident from a perusal of the prison statistics for recent years that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population.  For example, over the past 12 months the total number in custody has increased by 412 or a 10.41% rise in the number in custody. This increase — evident over recent years —  is due in large measure to the significant additional resources this Government has invested in the Criminal Justice System. The Garda Síochána has been increasingly successful in prosecuting criminals and combined with extra court sittings we have a higher rate of committals to our prison system which itself has also benefited from additional capital investment to provide new and upgraded prison spaces.The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. The Irish Prison Service has also used temporary release as a means of reducing numbers in times of significant overcrowding. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.Turning to data on the percentage of prisoners on temporary release again it may interest the Deputy to put some context on the current situation. For example in 1997 some 19.2% of prisoners were on temporary release. Turning to current figures over a decade later and mindful of our increased overall population, on 5 October 2010 there were 605 prisoners on temporary release. This represented 11.78% of the overall prisoner population for that day.  The figures for the corresponding date from 2002 onwards are as follows:YearTotal number on Temporary releaseTotal number in custody on
5 October 201020023103,15220032533,18420042483,16120051273,03720061673,20320071253,30920083293,57220096093,954The average number of prisoners on temporary release for each month this year is set out in the table below.MonthAverage on Temporary ReleaseJanuary551February647March750April836May882June943July870August709September659I have acknowledged previously our increasing prisoner population. In doing that I have also referred to the Government's commitment to providing resources to the Irish Prison Service so that an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure could be undertaken which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  This significant programme of capital works includes the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea and Wheatfield prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House. Since 1997 almost 1,800 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system and this figure will rise to 1,920 when the new block in Wheatfield is fully open.In addition, Government capital investment will allow the Irish Prison Service to continue with its building programme. The Irish Prison Service plan to commence construction later this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in 2012. Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces by the end of 2010.I am confident that the Government's continued commitment to providing additional prison spaces which these new developments will provide will no doubt assist the Irish Prison Service in reducing the rate of prisoners on temporary release in the future.

No prisoner has been on the waiting list for more than three months. Table 1. shows the number on the waiting list by prison.  I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the current waiting list will be cleared within 1 month.PrisonNumber of Waiting ListMountjoy23Midlands3Wheatfield2Cloverhill6A report on Prison Drug Treatment Services in Ireland (March 2008) highlighted the high level of need for addiction services among the prison population and the upward increase in the number of prisoners treated.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, because of concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, provisions were brought forward to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 also provides the Gardaí with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Gardaí to tackle misuse of alcohol.  Gardaí now have the power to seize alcohol in the possession of an under 18 year old which they suspect is for consumption in a public place.  They can also seize alcohol where they reasonably believe that there is the danger of public disorder or damage to property and require the person to leave the place. Gardaí may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  These notices are a more efficient and effective use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty.An Garda Síochána works to reduce public disorder by identifying and proactively targeting local hot spots and responding quickly to reports of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Operation Encounter has been in operation since 2002 to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour and specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988.  Almost 615,000 offences have been detected since the operation's commencement.Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to 30 September, 2010, 2,208 behaviour warnings have been issued to adults and 1,476 to children.  Fifteen good behaviour contracts have been made with children.  Four civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the courts.The Garda Adult Cautioning Scheme enables warnings to be issued to offenders in certain circumstances (specified by the Director of Public Prosecutions), instead of their being prosecuted.  While it reduces the volume of cases prosecuted through the courts by An Garda Síochána and allows less serious offenders, who are considered unlikely to re-offend, to have their cases dealt with expeditiously. It also forces offenders to confront the reality of the offences they have committed.  Most of the offences covered by the Scheme are public order and anti-social behaviour offences and include offences under the Public Order Act 1994 (for example, intoxication in a public place, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place and failure to comply with a direction of a Garda) and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts (for example, disorderly conduct).Tackling youth crime is a key priority for this Government.  The Government's policy on youth crime is set out in detail in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010.  This strategy is underpinned by the principles of the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The approach adopted by the Government involves the deployment of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, community Gardaí and the use of measures such as the Garda Diversion Programme, Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects, community sanctions and the incremental process of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders, all of which attempt to confront youth crime and related behaviours in an incremental way, with detention as a last resort.An Garda Síochána also works very closely with local authority personnel with regard to the enforcement of the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, in respect of anti-social behaviour and related matters, by persons provided with local authority housing.

I have asked the Commissioner for the latest report on the allocation of Garda Reserve members throughout the country and as soon as this becomes available I will communicate it  to the Deputy.  The Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full time strength of the Force. Recruitment is ongoing and the Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve. The moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary.  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for determining the range of powers and duties of Reserve members, and I am sure that he will keep these under review in line with the recommendation of the Inspectorate.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I am informed by the Garda Commissioner, that following the publication of the Garda Inspectorate Report on Resource Allocation, Deputy Commissioner Strategy and Change Management was appointed to consider the report and to co-ordinate an agreed and pragmatic programme of work to advance the implementation of the twenty-seven recommendations. My officials will work closely with the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate on implementation of the recommendations in order to maximise efficient allocation of Garda resources.While every effort will be made to progress the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report on Resource Allocation, it is recognised by both An Garda Síochána and the Garda Inspectorate that, due to the current economic situation, there is limited scope to fund change proposals.  Where recommendations involve significant capital costs, interim measures, where possible, will be considered until such time as funding is available for full implementation. However, implementation of some recommendations will not require capital investment and I am keen to make progress, in particular, on necessary revision of Garda rosters, the implementation of which is included under the Transformation Agenda which has been agreed with the Garda representative bodies. I am also keen to progress an examination of station opening hours as part of measures to improve the matching of Garda resources to the demand for policing services.

The position remains essentially as stated. However, I would like to add that in August I published the 2009 Annual Report of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Garda Diversion Programme. This report showed   a reduction of 13% in the number of incidents referred to the programme and the 14% reduction in the number of children referred, compared to 2008.  The number of children deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the Diversion Programme provides a reliable indicator of the number of children considered for prosecution before the courts. The Diversion Programme Reports for 2004 and 2009 show that 2,718 children were deemed unsuitable for diversion in 2004 compared to 2,966 in 2009. This is an increase of 248 children, which is equivalent to a 9.1% increase over 5 years.

Subsequent investigations carried out by the Passport Service and by the Gardaí have confirmed that the eight Irish passports used were forgeries and it was concluded that an Israeli Government agency was responsible for the misuse and, most likely, the manufacture of the forged Irish passports.  The Garda investigation into the matter is ongoing and if evidence is forthcoming to indicate the commission of criminal offences in this jurisdiction a file will be submitted to the DPP on completion of enquiries.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	476	Crystal meth is a form of methamphetamine and as such is a controlled drug under schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984. As such, it is subject to stringent controls. It has no medicinal use and cannot be prescribed by doctors, sold or distributed and it is also illegal to possess the drug. The chemicals used to produce the drug are strictly controlled and monitored under both EU and national regulations.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the misuse of methamphetamine/methylam-phetamine (‘crystal meth') has never been exclusively confined to foreign nationals. However, in 2009 there were only 27 cases of methamphetamine recorded at the Forensic Science Laboratory, the majority of which primarily involved Eastern European nationals. In 2007, the Garda National Drugs Unit hosted an international seminar, under the EU-funded AGIS Programme, to examine the potential threat posed by methamphetamine within the European Union. Among the findings of that seminar were that the drug is not currently regarded as one of the more prolific misused drugs in Ireland and that the very real dangers associated with this drug are enough of a deterrent for most users. Nonetheless, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda National Drugs Unit, as part of its national remit, and in liaison with its European counterparts, will continue to closely monitor the availability of the drug within this jurisdiction, based on an on-going analysis of intelligence and drug-seizure data.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Assistant Commissioner appointed by the Garda Commissioner to examine the findings of the Dublin Archdiocese report relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both Church and State authorities, and to carry out such investigations and enquiries as he deems appropriate, is continuing his examination of the report. I am assured that he will complete his examination and other appropriate enquiries as expeditiously as possible, following which he will report to the Commissioner. When he does so, the Commissioner will consult with the law officers on issues arising in respect of criminal liability.I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that the Health Service Executive is continuing its audit of Catholic dioceses to ensure that it, as the statutorily responsible body, is fully aware of all cases of clerical child sex abuse known to the Church and that each diocese is prepared, in terms of the policies and procedures in place, to handle allegation of child sexual abuse and prevent the possibility of such abuse in the future. The HSE hopes to complete its audit in the near future, following which it will submit its report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. A HSE audit of religious orders is also under way. Consideration of the results of these investigations will include consideration of what further actions require to be taken, including a possible extension of the Commission's remit. The Commission is at present examining the Diocese of Cloyne, and the Government has extended its term to 31 October to allow this work to be completed. Bringing the perpetrators of child sexual abuse to justice, whenever and wherever the abuse occurred, must be the absolute priority. I repeat my call and that of the Commissioner for any person, including any member of the clergy, who has any knowledge of such abuse to contact An Garda Síochána.

Phase one comprises essential preliminary works to facilitate the prison development including the construction of a dedicated access road, the installation of off-site services and the construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison.Access RoadI am pleased to advise the Deputy that a contract for the construction of the access road to serve the prison development was awarded to SIAC Construction Limited in July 2010 and construction work is already well under way in relation to this phase of the project. The access road and underpass are expected to be completed in February next year.Off-site WorksA procurement competition for the installation of the off-site services (e.g. water mains, sewerage and communications/technology ducts) to serve the prison development issued to companies on the Irish Prison Service Construction Framework in August. The closing date was 6 October 2010 and the evaluation of the tenders by the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisors has commenced. It is intended to award a contract in respect of the off-site works in November. The work will take approximately eight months to complete.Perimeter Security WallThe procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter wall of the prison is already in progress.  A pre-qualification competition from which suitably qualified contractors will be invited to tender for the design and construction of the perimeter wall of the prison and related works issued on the E-Tenders web site in August 2010. The closing date for expressions of interest was 28 September 2010. Twenty submissions were received  and the evaluation of these submissions is already under way. A short list comprising 5 to 7 candidates will be established from this procurement competition and these candidates will be invited to tender for the construction of the perimeter wall and ancillary works later this month. Construction of the perimeter wall is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and will take just under a year to complete.Prison BuildingsAs I mentioned previously in the House, my priority is to provide good quality, regime focused prison accommodation at Thornton Hall prison campus as quickly as possible. A phased development of the prison campus is now being pursued. The next phase of the works will see the procurement of prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities commencing in the New Year using traditional procurement methods.  This phase will provide 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners. Subsequent phases will see the balance of 1,000 cells provided at the site.

The selected supplier will have responsibility for ensuring monitoring and survey sessions are conducted in accordance with the schedules and providing survey and monitoring data to An Garda Síochána. The selected supplier will provide the necessary vehicles, monitoring and survey equipment and operating personnel. An Garda Síochána will issue fixed charge notices to speeding drivers who are detected and pursue any court prosecutions undertaken.The service provider will be paid according to the level of service provided. The number of speeding drivers detected by the service provider will have no effect on the level of payment made. The purpose of the contract is to reduce speed, and so increase road safety, not to generate revenue either for the State or the service provider.

This vocational specialism facilitates personal development and provides an introduction to the knowledge and practical skills of hair care, beauty care, body care, customer care and salon care. It is useful as a preparation for employment or possible future training in the hairdressing or beauty business. Students can also apply the knowledge and skills acquired to improving their own personal presentation.The LCA emphasises experiential learning practical project and portfolio work and the completion of tasks throughout the cycle towards the final assessment. Courses are offered in 3 main areas - vocational preparation and training, (including enterprise and a work experience programme and communications) general education and vocational education. The programme is modular and vocational specialisms are chosen from the range which includes  Agriculture/Horticulture, Hotel, Catering and Tourism, Engineering Technology Office Skills and Retail Distribution, Community Care, Construction/Manufacturing, Craft and Design IT, Hair Care Leisure Studies.  Students are examined in English and Communications, 2 vocational specialisms, Mathematical Applications, Language (Irish and Modern European language) and Social education. Some 6700 students (2 year cohort) follow this option. Other than in the Leaving Certificate Applied there are no plans for the inclusion of Hairdressing in the second level curriculum.It should also be noted that hairdressing awards approved by the Further Education and Training Awards Council are also available in Post Leaving Certificate Courses, the Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme for unemployed adults, the Back to Education Initiative, programmes for early school leavers such as Youthreach and in FÁS programmes, both as major and minor awards.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 3.3 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department's website. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.I can also confirm to the Deputy that in March 2010 the school authority was approved grant aid for the provision of 1 Mainstream Classroom and 2 Resource Rooms to meet the school's immediate needs.

Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, resides less than 3 kilometres from school and therefore is not eligible for school transport.  It is open to pupils who reside less than 3.2 kilometres from their nearest school to apply for concessionary fare-paying transport to the school which they are attending. Concessionary transport is offered subject to a number of terms and conditions, including the availability of spare seating on an existing service.  The parents of the pupil referred to by the Deputy should liaise with their local Bus Éireann office regarding the availability of concessionary transport.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) was introduced in 2004 to provide devolved funding to individual school authorities to undertake small scale building works which, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school.  Since then, thousands of projects have been completed in schools — such as gas, electrical and mechanical works, roof replacements and repairs, windows replacement, toilet upgrades, structural improvements and access works.  A key principle behind this Scheme is that responsibility for the management of the project is devolved to the school authority.  The school authority can make use of its local knowledge and presence on the ground to manage the project more effectively and ensure better value for money for the taxpayer.A total of €128 million was allocated for Summer Works Scheme in 2010.  The list of approved schools/projects is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.  Approved 2010 Summer Works Grants for Schools in the Dublin area are as follows: Dublin Belgard Schools — in excess of €7.226 million; Dublin City Schools — in excess of €18.324 million; Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown Schools — in excess of €6.564 million; Dublin Fingal Schools — in excess of €3.659 million.

I have also previously confirmed to the Deputy that the Government is aware that individuals who invested some or all of their pension funds in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) because they did not satisfy the specified income requirement at retirement, may later satisfy that condition. The Government has decided to allow those individuals who meet the specified income conditions after retirement to have their AMRFs treated as ARFs to which they will have access. Details of how these changes are to be given effect are being examined as part of the work on the implementation of the Framework.  In my reply to the Deputy's question in June last, I said that I considered that these matters would be dealt with in legislation next year and that the details would be made known at that time.

No. 454 of 2010) was signed by the Taoiseach on 21 September 2010.   The terms of reference, as set out in the Order are:"a commission is established to investigate the following specific matters considered by the Government to be of significant public concern and requiring, in the public interest, an expedited examination:(a) the main causes of the serious failure, during the period 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009, within each of the covered institutions, to implement and adhere to, appropriate standards and controls (including checks and balances) in the context of corporate governance and prudent risk management policy and procedures such as would have avoided the requirement for the provision of exceptional financial support from the State;(b) the main causes for the adoption, during the period 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009, by the Boards of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation and Irish Nationwide Building Society of business models and strategies, and the implementation by the senior managements of those institutions of business and lending practices, which resulted in those institutions experiencing severe financial distress;(c) whether in respect of the period 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009 the external auditors of the covered institutions commented in their audit reports or other communications to the institutions concerned on the failures referred to in subparagraph (a) or the business models and strategies and business and lending practices referred to in subparagraph (b);(d) the main causes for the failures, during the period 1 January 2003 to 28 September 2008, in the performance of the statutory roles and responsibilities of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland in respect of the regulation and supervision of the covered institutions and the maintenance of financial stability, in particular in relation to the supervision and oversight of corporate governance and risk management policies and practices in the covered institutions, and the relevance in that regard of any advices or directions given by the Department of Finance to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland in relation to its supervisory role.The Commission shall complete the report or reports required in relation to its investigation no later than 6 months from the date of its establishment."I might add that during the debate in the Dáil on 8 July 2010 on the motion to approve the Order establishing the Commission, I agreed to seek the approval of the Government for an amendment to the terms of reference to extend the period to be investigated by the Commission of Investigation from 28 September 2008 to 15 January 2009 in respect of subparagraph (d) above.  Subject to the agreement of the Government, a draft amending Order will shortly be laid before both Houses for approval.

The general rule is that any financial capacity levels required must be relevant and proportionate to the needs of the contract.   My Department recently issued new guidelines to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in public procurement opportunities.  As part of these provisions, public bodies were firmly reminded that the levels they set for suitability criteria (especially in relation to a potential tenderer's turnover) must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract and guidance was provided on these matters.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	509	There are two principal measures of government debt. The National Debt is the total outstanding amount of principal borrowed by Central Government and not repaid to date less liquid assets available for redemption of those liabilities at the same date. The General Government Debt (GGD) is the standard measurement of gross indebtedness used for comparative purposes within the EU. It also includes the debts of the non-commercial state-sponsored bodies, the extra budgetary funds, as well as the debt of local authorities. Also, the General Government Debt is a gross measure.As the General Government measure was not used prior to the implementation of the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, National Debt is the appropriate measure when comparing the evolution of government debt since the 1980s.   The National Debt peaked at 117.6% of GNP (106.8% of GDP) in 1987. From then it started to fall back to 99.4% of GNP (88% of GDP) in 1990, 73.2% of GNP (64.6% of GDP) in 1996 and 40.8% of GNP (34.8% of GDP) in 2000. It continued to fall to a low of 23.1% of GNP (19.8% of GDP) by 2007, one of the smallest in the EU and indeed in the world.  Since the economic downturn National Debt has inevitably risen and had reached 57.3% of GNP (47.1% of GDP) in 2009. According to the National Treasury Management Agency, National Debt was approximately 70% of GNP (56% of GDP) by the end of September this year.Restoring sustainability to the public finances is a necessary step in creating an environment that will facilitate growth in our economy. Increasing levels of borrowing mean more and more of the Government's resources must be spent on servicing debt as opposed to being used to support the economy and provide public services. The focus of all in Government is firmly fixed on improving the fiscal and economic position and at the same time on ensuring that, as far as possible, we protect the economy and generate employment.

In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  In assessing a medical card/GP visit card application, the HSE uses guidelines based on people's means which includes their income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. The assessment process also takes account of other factors, such as medical need, which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services.Under the HSE's Medical Card/GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines, savings or similar investments of €36,000 for a single person are disregarded.The next €10,000 in savings is assessed as income of one Euro per week per €1,000.The next €10,000 in savings is assessed as income of two Euro per week per €1,000.Savings in excess of the above are assessed as income of four Euro per week per €1,000.I following table gives details of the current Medical Card and GP Visit Card income guidelines.CategoryMedical Card Weekly amountGP Visit Card Weekly amount€€

Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Since 1 October 2010, medical card holders are required to pay a 50c charge for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists. The charges are subject to a cap of  €10 per month for each person or family. Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme. There are no plans to exempt any other products or categories of patients from the charge.

The Home Help Service is also a critical mainstream support to older people in facilitating  their early discharge from hospital and in preventing inappropriate admission to acute hospitals and long-stay residential care. As the budget for the Home Help service is finite, the outturn position in relation to the number of clients at the end of each year can depend on a number of operational factors, including the demands and complexities involved in providing the service to clients over the course of the year.

Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located projects.  The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  A core principle underlying the co-location initiative is that the private sector should bear all normal business risks. It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  There is a requirement on each of the successful bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.  The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.

I acknowledge the evidence of the benefits of early interventions for diabetes patients suffering foot problems.  GPs are competent in managing diabetes and all of its complications including those affecting the foot.  In relation to the diabetic foot screening programme, this has been prioritised under the National Diabetes Programme.  This initiative is currently at an advanced planning stage and several meetings have been held between the various stakeholders, including clinical specialists, podiatrists, diabetes specialist nurses and the Diabetes Federation of Ireland.  It is hoped that the programme will encompass not just foot screening but care of patients with at-risk feet.  It will provide for the prevention and management of foot ulcers, thereby reducing the number of hospital in-patients beds occupied by patients with foot problems.   The programme will also establish referral pathways with rapid access to specialised care within a multidisciplinary foot-care service.  The cost of implementation of the proposed programme will be met from within current resources.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	523	In 2009 my Department received a total of 5,797 Parliamentary Questions, 55% (3,179 P.Q.s) of which were referred to other bodies, mainly the HSE for reply. These questions related to operational issues, a large number of which concerned individual cases.The operation of the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE's extensive network of operations. More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive Officer and his management team.In 2007 the Executive worked to a timeframe of responding to referred questions within 20 working days and this target was met for 65% of referred questions. From January 2008, this timeframe was reduced to 15 working days and 73% of referred questions were answered within this period. In 2009, 62% of questions referred to the Executive were answered within the 15 day timeframe.However, between January and September 1st of this year, the number of questions answered within the 15 day timeframe dropped to 43%. This was due to a period of industrial action which commenced on a limited basis within the Health Service Executive on 4 January 2010 and which escalated in effect from 1 March through to 15 June. In effect no new Parliamentary Questions could be forwarded to the Executive by my Department during the latter period.The Executive is very conscious of the need for prompt responses to Parliamentary Questions and there is regular liaison between my Department and the Executive in this regard. While the Executive attempts to answer all questions referred to it as quickly as possible, many of the questions submitted by Deputies request large and detailed amounts of statistical data on a variety of subjects which require input and co-ordination from all areas of the Executive. Recent questions of this nature submitted to my Department include:the number of home help hours provided in each year from 2007 to 2010 on a county basis;the number of TB cases diagnosed in every county for each year between 2005 and 2010;the number of persons on the waiting list for hearing aids in each HSE region;the number of persons currently on waiting lists to see consultants in every hospital and the length of time each person has been on the list.Given the volume of information sought in these type of questions, the Deputy will appreciate that it may not be possible to provide responses to such questions in the timeframe suggested by the Deputy. However, my officials are working closely with the HSE to try to improve the service to members of the Oireachtas generally including questions and representations relating to individuals. I am aware that the Department of Social Protection provides a high standard of service in this regard.At recent meetings with the new CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, I have stressed the importance of providing responses to Parliamentary Questions that are both prompt and of a high quality. Mr. Magee is very aware of my concerns in this regard and is committed to improving the handling of parliamentary affairs within the HSE.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services in the short term was to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital and accordingly, a Service Level Agreement is in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to BCH. This is in addition to the services available at St Luke's Hospital, Dublin and at University Hospital Galway.The Government also decided in 2005 to explore the scope in the medium term for developing a joint venture based on a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast City Hospital. In April 2008, Minister McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&PS), Northern Ireland announced the provision of a satellite centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin.  It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland.  It also recognises the potential for cross Border co-operation in the development of this resource.  I welcomed the announcement by Minister McGimpsey and officials from my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland continue to hold discussions in this regard.   I understand that the facility is expected to be operational by 2015.I met with the group referred to by the Deputy in October last year during which a number of issues were discussed, including the development at Altnagelvin. My Department has also been in correspondence with the group within the past year. It remains the position that the Business Case for the development has now been finalised and is awaiting approval by Minister McGimpsey.My Department and the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme have nominated representatives to the Cross Border Sub Group, the Project Board and the Service Design and Workforce Planning Subgroup for the development. I have committed to providing a capital contribution to the development, in recognition of the fact that approximately one third of the patients who will attend the Altnagelvin Centre will be from Donegal and the surrounding areas. In addition, the Health Service Executive's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) will contribute on an agreed basis to the operating costs in respect of patients from the Republic of Ireland who attend this service.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The contract between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and general practitioners (GPs) under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to private patients and to GMS patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Most recent figures supplied by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department show 343,399 medical card holders aged 70 or over as at 1 September 2010.  Following the enactment of the Health Act 2008, the HSE wrote to all medical card holders aged 70 or over in January 2009 advising them to complete a return slip if they were over the threshold for a medical card.  Approximately, 12,000 clients responded and their cards were removed from the Executive's medical card register.  In addition, approximately 5,000 medical cards for persons aged 70 or over were removed from the medical card register in 2009 as part of the HSE's medical card data quality exercise.It had been estimated that 20,000 persons aged 70 or over would lose eligibility to a medical card under this measure, resulting in savings in the region of €20 million.  A further €16 million in savings was targeted through the introduction of a revised capitation fee in respect of medical card holders aged 70 or over living in the community.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the actual annual savings resulting from the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Details of the number of medical cards and GP visit cards are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The figures are provided on a net basis, showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances. The most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE reflect the position as at 1 September 2010 and show 1,578,613 medical card holders and 106,373 GP visit card holders on that date. There were 343,399 medical card holders and 236 GP visit card holders aged 70 and over as at 1st September 2010.The HSE has produced National Medical Card/GP Visit Card Assessment Guidelines for its staff and these are regularly updated in order to provide a clear framework for decision makers to assist them in making reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing people under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.The HSE with my full support, decided to centralise the processing of all medical cards and GP visit card applications and renewals to its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. In January 2009, the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  In September 2009, the processing of all applications from two Local Health Offices in Dublin transferred to the PCRS. The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals will ensure a consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the number of card holders by region and the number of cards withdrawn in recent years.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 157 together.I am, of course, deeply concerned about the incidence of gang related murders and I deplore all such killings.  All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda Síochána in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is also reflected in the Garda policing plan for this year, and specific initiatives, including under Operation Anvil and involving members of the Emergency Response Unit, have been put in place.I am informed by the Garda authorities that multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where National Units — the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau — are used to combat serious crime, including gangland crime.  These Units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section which assists with intelligence briefings and timely information.This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a coordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.  These specific initiatives are in addition to the activities of all members of An Garda Síochána in implementing and enforcing the criminal law.It was in that overall context that I introduced greatly strengthened legislation in the area of organised crime which is being fully utilised by An Garda Síochána, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Criminal Procedure Act 2010.  To date, eight individuals have been charged under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act of directing the activities of a criminal organisation or participating or contributing to certain activities.  Other offences against the legislation are under investigation.I have introduced further significant legislative proposals in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, and I will not hesitate to introduce additional measures if that becomes necessary. In addition, I have secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.All cases of murder where proceedings have not yet been taken remain under active investigation.  The detection rate by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the law officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore, such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.While An Garda Síochána has made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, the reality is that there can be considerable difficulties in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities from associates of a victim of a gangland killing, or indeed from gangland figures even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.  Against that background, I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the period 2007 to 2010, up to 5 October, 64 gang related murders were recorded.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	542	It is worth making the point at the outset that all members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with the investigation of criminal activity, including child pornography.  Specifically in relation to this type of crime, the Sexual Crime Management Unit was recently established within the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.The functions of this unit include the evaluation and monitoring, in conjunction with the investigating member and local senior management, the investigation of child sexual abuse, child neglect and other selected sexual offences, to ensure that such investigations are receiving the appropriate attention and being brought to a prompt conclusion in accordance with best practice in investigation methodology. The Unit also acts as a Central Point of Contact for Divisional and District Senior Investigating Officers tasked with the investigation of this specific type of crime.Personnel currently allocated to the Unit include 1 Detective Inspector, 1 Detective Sergeant and 5 Detective Gardai. Interviews are ongoing at present to fill a number of other vacancies within the Unit. Members of this Unit are qualified in interviewing suspects and injured parties, are fully conversant in Garda Policy in the area and will undergo training as Specialist Victim Interviewers and in the assessment and management of Sex Offenders, where appropriate.Resources within the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, in particular within the Computer Crime Investigation Unit, are also utilised by Senior Investigating Officers in the investigation of sexual crimes involving the forensic examination of computer media seized where images of child pornography are suspected.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	544	The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009. At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process. However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of ten to 12 weeks, given that demand is particularly high at present.The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis. In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are under review at present, in the light of the increasing demands being made upon it.

As I have previously informed the House, the vast majority of females who entered or were placed in Magdalen Laundries did so without any direct involvement of the State.  It may be helpful to the Deputy to know that my Department's research indicates that a small proportion of entrants to Magdalen Laundries came through the criminal justice system — women offenders under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 or a suspended sentence.  In addition, one institution was used for a period as a remand centre for young women charged with criminal offences.   The detail of the role of the criminal justice system, including the limited  records held by my Department and the National Archives,  are set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 94 on 13 May 2010 and that remains the position.My Department has met with representatives of Justice for the Magdalenes, has exchanged views and offered every assistance possible to allow access to the limited available records in the normal way.  However, there are no plans to introduce a State funded redress scheme.  I remain, of course,  open to considering any further assistance by, for example, the continued sharing of records that might be provided to the many elderly survivors and/or the families of people who were in these institutions.

The person concerned was informed of this decision in a letter issued to him on 3 February, 2009.The granting of Irish Citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour and not an entitlement. Applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. I do not consider that a meeting would serve any beneficial purpose.Having regard to the overall resources available, which are kept under constant review, the procedures involved in the processing of applications for certificates of naturalisation have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary and sufficient to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  There is no appeals process under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, however it is open to the person in question to lodge a new application for a certificate of naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department at any time.

I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

It also plans to purchase a fourth tractor from an existing National Procurement Service contract for the supply of tractors.  The tractors are being purchased to replace existing tractors which require constant repair and maintenance due to their age.The Irish Prison Service intends to use the tractors at its two open centres, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  There are already significant agricultural, horticultural and other environmental activities in the two open centres, which between them have in the region of 125 acres of land surrounding the accommodation units. Both centres have had substantial increases in prisoner populations in recent years and it is intended to extend the range of outdoor activities and increase the daily employment and vocational training opportunities for the prisoners.   I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the proposal to purchase the tractors in question has been carefully evaluated to ensure that the proposed expenditure is justified on both financial and operational grounds.

Under the current Circular, the fees paid under the various categories range  from €8,978 to €29,888 for Chairpersons and from €5,985 to €14,963 for Directors.It is not feasible to extract the information sought by the Deputy without a disproportionate use of resources in disaggregating individual costs which I do not believe can be justified in the current climate.  I also wish to advise the Deputy that the Financial Emergency Measures providing for the reduction of the remuneration of certain persons in the Public Service  have been applied to  the fees payable to members of all boards under the aegis of my Department.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The person concerned arrived in the State on 31st August 2006. She claimed asylum on 1st September 2006  and her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned was informed by letter dated 20th May 2008 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons  why she should not be deported.Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. On 21st September 2010 having considered all representations submitted on her behalf,  I signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB),13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 14th October 2010 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The enforcement of the deportation order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), in evaluating the safety of making returns to Nigeria and other third countries. In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there are no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.   Further, I am satisfied that the application made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently her representations as to why she should not be deported, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I am advised by INIS that the holding of this permission does not extend to the issuance of a temporary travel document.In exceptional cases an application for Irish temporary travel document may be considered in respect of qualifying non Irish nationals who are resident in Ireland.  In all such cases, INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.  The person concerned has to show that they have made reasonable and formal efforts to obtain a national passport, that it has been formally and unreasonably refused and that their own consular authorities are unable to offer consular assistance to them whilst resident in the State.The INIS informs me that the person concerned has had two recent applications for Irish temporary travel documents refused on 02 September 2010 and 23 September 2010. He was advised on both occasions to contact his own consular authorities to establish the procedures to be followed which would allow for him to procure a national passport whilst resident in this State without the assistance of the Irish authorities.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	572	The firearms provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 completed the necessary updating of our firearms licensing process.  I have always made it clear that it was not brought forward specifically in the context of tackling gangland crime.The 2009 Act brought in a wide range of measures to modernise the licensing system and to increase public safety. In this regard, all firearm owners must also comply with the security requirements as laid down in S.I. 307 of 2009 Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009. The minimum security standards required at a dwelling is dependent on the number and calibre of firearms held by an individual. This requirement applies to owners of all firearms.  A person applying for a Firearm Certificate for target-shooting must now be a member of an authorised rifle or pistol club as laid down in the Firearms (Authorisation of Rifle or Pistol Clubs) Regulations, 2009 (S.I. 308 of 2009).In relation to criminals and the work of the Gardaí, An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan 2010 sets out the commitment to proactively target groups and individuals engaged in organised crime and to this end there are currently a number of intelligence-led operations focusing on organised crime groups in the Greater Dublin area and regional cities.  A key part of these operations is a focus on stemming the supply of firearms to such groups.  As a direct result of these operations, a number of individuals are before the courts charged with serious offences concerning the sale and supply of firearms.The Organised Crime Unit (OCU), within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, in particular, is committed to tackling the issue of organised crime, including the illegal importation of firearms.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	573	An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan 2010 sets out a commitment to proactively target groups and individuals engaged in organised crime.  To this end a number of intelligence-led operations, such as Operation Anvil, which focuses on organised crime groups in the Greater Dublin area and regional cities are currently being supported. A key part of these operations is a focus on stemming the supply of firearms to such groups.  As a direct result of these operations, a number of individuals are before the courts charged with serious offences concerning the sale and supply of firearms.  Since the commencement of Operation Anvil in excess of 1,400 firearms have been recovered in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with a further 1,800 seized outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region up to the end of August, 2010.The Organised Crime Unit (OCU) operating within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, in particular, is committed to tackling the issue of organised crime, including the illegal importation of firearms.  In this regard, inter-agency cooperation is essential and the OCU maintains close liaison with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency in the United Kingdom.  Officers attend formal cross-border and international conferences and engage in joint policing operations targeting organised criminals operating within these jurisdictions. An Garda Síochána also has Liaison Officers based in the UK, The Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, with officers currently also seconded to Europol and Interpol. There is also strong inter-agency cooperation with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs) and the Naval Service.There are, of course, already very severe penalties for firearms offences in place under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For example, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and using a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape carry a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Possessing a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, possessing a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, carrying a firearm with criminal intent and altering a firearm carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.  In addition, the controls on the issue of firearms certificates, and the conditions under which weapons can be held, have been strengthened in order to ensure that legitimately held firearms remain as far from the reach of criminals as possible.The organised crime situation remains under constant review by senior management in An Garda Síochána.  Members of An Garda Síochána are utilising all available legislation, including additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 relating to organised crime.  An Garda Síochána will continue to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of such crimes.

My Department is considering, in consultation with the Attorney General, the recent High Court judgment in the Clarke case.  In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, as part of its Third Programme of Law Reform 2008-2014, the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Jury Service on 29th March 2010, inviting submissions on the paper and its provisional recommendations. I look forward to the publication of the Commission’s final report and recommendations.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	575	The need to urgently modernise the prison estate and replace Mountjoy prison has been well documented both by the Inspector of Prisons and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The prison development at Thornton Hall remains a cornerstone of our prison modernisation programme.The Government recently approved the procurement of the first phase of the prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities for the prison campus at Thornton Hall. This work will proceed and will result in  the provision of 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners.   Work has already started on the construction of the access road and  the procurement process for the other aspects of the project are being advanced.  I cannot give a date for the completion of work on the first phase prison buildings until the tendering process has been completed but realistically speaking, one could not expect the new facility to be available before 2014.This project has been identified in the Government's Infrastructure Investment Priorities 2010-2016 and funding for this project is being made available from within the capital envelope for my Department.  The Deputy may also wish to know that the contract for the construction of the access road to serve the prison development was awarded to SIAC Construction Limited in July and construction work is already well under way in relation to this phase of the project. The access road and underpass are scheduled to be completed during February next year.A procurement competition for the installation of the off-site services to serve the prison development issued to companies on the Irish Prison Service Construction Framework in August. The closing date was 6 October 2010 and the evaluation of the tenders by the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisors has commenced. It is intended to award the contract in respect of the off-site works in November. The work will take approximately eight months to complete.The procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison is already in progress.  A pre-qualification competition from which suitably qualified contractors will be invited to tender for the design and construction of the perimeter wall of the prison and related works issued on the E-Tenders web site in August 2010. The closing date for expressions of interest was 28 September 2010.  Twenty submissions were received  and the evaluation of these submissions is already under way. A panel comprising 5 to 7 contractors will be established from this procurement competition and these contractors will be invited to tender for the construction of the perimeter security wall later this month. Construction of the perimeter security wall is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and will take just under a year to complete.  The procurement process for the design and construction of the first phase of prison accommodation blocks will get under way early in 2011.In relation to expenditure on the project, the total expenditure to end September is €42.46 million.   This sum includes the site cost of €29.9 million. The cost of the site was almost completely offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh County Dublin for €29 million. An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired at a cost of €1.3 million to provide a dedicated access route to the main prison site. This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the potential effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.The total expenditure to date also includes €7.3 million expended on professional fees, €2.9 million on site preparation and various surveys, €0.5 million on landscaping and €0.5 million on security.  As is the case with all major infrastructure projects a comprehensive set of geological, engineering, archaeological and environmental surveys have been undertaken at the site in order to advance the construction programme for the development.  These surveys will enable the Irish Prison Service to accelerate the timeframe for the construction of the first phase of the prison buildings to a maximum of two years.

Such property includes houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. However, it does not include property such as the home at which they reside or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business.For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a formula. Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made.  The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale. Such an estimate will have regard to reductions in prices over recent years.In establishing the current market value of a property, my Department may make enquiry of the State Valuation Office. Alternatively, the market value may be established through receipt of a reasonable current valuation from a registered auctioneer, with reference to the purchase price and date of purchase of the property or, alternatively, the inspector may agree a valuation with a customer having regard to the type and location of the individual property and prevailing market values in that area.  These provisions apply in the case of a homeowner who buys a house without having sold their original home.  Where a claimant considers that a decision on his or her claim is based on a market value of a property which is too high, he or she may appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

The HSE further advised that the person concerned appealed the decision to the HSE Appeals Office in July 2010. The Appeals Office in the HSE upheld the decision to refuse SWA.

Under the NEAP unemployed people are referred to FÁS on reaching specified duration thresholds on the live register.  FÁS provides a range of services and supports to employers and jobseekers, including unemployed people referred under the NEAP.  These services include local job matching and on-line services for jobseekers and employers with access provided to jobs data, vacancies, CVs, etc.   The NEAP is a key element of the Government's labour market policy and it is based on the well-established principle that early intervention reduces the likely duration of unemployment.The recently published ESRI report (National Profiling of the Unemployed in Ireland. ESRI Research Series No. 10) developed a statistical profiling model for Ireland that would identify individuals with a high risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The report quantifies the relative impact of a range of factors which contribute to long-term unemployment. These factors include low education levels, poor literacy or numeracy, advanced age or a history of unemployment periods in recent years. Effective prevention depends on being able to identify those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed at an early stage, and referring them to appropriate labour market programmes to improve their chances of obtaining employment. The implementation of the profiling model is currently in progress in the Department.It is envisaged that the implementation of the profiling model will prove very effective in targeting resources appropriately and will therefore significantly enhance the current NEAP process.The transfer of the employment services function of FÁS to the Department of Social Protection will also ensure a more coherent approach to the needs of jobseekers and employers.  Bringing together, under the aegis of one department, the employment services of FÁS, the expertise of its placement officers and the unemployment services of this department, will facilitate the delivery of a more effective and streamlined response to the needs of both the unemployed and employers. Enhancements to existing FÁS services, or complementary ones, that facilitate matching vacancies with jobseekers will be examined in this context.

The SWA scheme is the "safety net” within the overall social welfare system in that it provides a basic income support payment to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the SWA scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  However, SWA cannot at any time be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of HRC.  Once-off exceptional needs payments under the SWA scheme may be made to eligible applicants without reference to the HRC.  These payments, including assistance with travel costs, may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Health Service Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Statistics are not available on the numbers of Irish nationals who received support.The vast majority of Irish nationals applying for social welfare support satisfy the HRC condition.  Between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2009, of those Irish nationals whose circumstances called for detailed investigation in this respect, 89% were found to satisfy the HRC.  Only 11% were refused on HRC grounds.  Figures for claimants refused SWA on HRC grounds are not included in these statistics as these statistics are not maintained by the various Health Service Executive areas.Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the habitual residence condition.  However in the case of disallowance, every notice of disallowance sets out the claimant's rights to request a review of the decision or to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  These options allow every claimant the opportunity to produce additional evidence in support of their case, and to have any error of judgment addressed appropriately.

Some never previously lived or worked here and claimed a social welfare payment almost immediately on entry to this country even though it was not their intention to reside permanently in this State. Accordingly, they do not meet the criteria for the habitual residence condition.Statistics on the number of Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) claims that do not satisfy the habitual residence condition are not maintained by the various HSE areas. However, it is estimated that approximately 1.5% of all SWA claims are disallowed for HRC reasons.It is open to any customer who is not satisfied with the decision on their claim to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

Increases in the State pension (contributory) have brought the personal rate of pension to a maximum weekly rate up to €230.30 per week.  A pensioner couple would be eligible for a weekly income of €436.60.  These pension increases exceeded increases in prices over the period so that significant improvements were made in real terms in pension rates.In Budget 2010, the Government avoided any cuts in the State pension.  Weekly rates of payments to pensioners (those 66 and over) were not reduced and neither were other supports such as the Household Benefits package which includes the free TV licence, electricity/gas allowance and telephone allowance.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  However, I have urged local authorities to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and in 2010 Dublin City Council has reduced its ARV by 2%.My Department continues to keep matters relating to commercial rates under regular review.

The results of the most recent survey, in March 2008, reported a total of 1,436 homeless households in Dublin, compared with 1,361 in 2005.  While this was a numerical increase of around 5%, the position relative to overall population was unchanged.  A further 708 households were recorded as residing in long-term or transitional accommodation; however, it would not be correct to regard all of these as homeless, particularly where, for example, households were resident in suitable accommodation that would be likely to provide their most appropriate home in the long-term, or where they had begun to make a transition out of homelessness.The Counted In survey method was also used for the first time in Cork, Galway and Limerick in 2008. The results indicated a total of 767 households homeless in these centres.  However, that figure includes households in long-term and transitional accommodation some of whom, as indicated in relation to Dublin, should not properly be regarded as homeless.  The next Counted In survey is due to take place in 2011.

It is a matter for the relevant planning authority, and An Bord Pleanála in the event of an appeal, to decide what conditions it is appropriate, in the interests of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, to attach to a particular planning permission.My Department issued Sustainable Urban Housing — Design Standards for New Apartments   to planning authorities in September 2007.  On the matter of recycling, the Guidelines recommend that:the communal storage area should be sufficient to satisfy the 3-bin system for the collection of mixed dry recyclables, organic waste and residual waste,Consideration should be given to the provision of separate collection facilities for other recyclables such as glass and plastics.My Department's Guidelines on Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities   (2007) also recommend that in the layout of apartment schemes, consideration should be given to providing for communal storage/refuse collection points, including separate storage for recyclable materials as required by the local authority for the area.  The Guidelines state that such areas should be located and designed so as not to detract from the visual quality of the development while not compromising the need to ensure convenience and accessibility as well as safety and security for residents and management/ maintenance personnel using the facilities. The guidelines are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie  .

The EPA has published an inventory and risk classification of historic mine sites jointly with the Geological Survey of Ireland; copies can be downloaded from the Agency's website at www.epa.ieA ministerial policy direction was issued on 3 May 2005 in regard to compliance by local authorities with the requirements of section 22 of the Waste Management Act 1996 to prepare an inventory and risk assessment of all non-licensed closed landfills where disposal or recovery activities have taken place.  In addition, under the Waste Management (Certification of Historic Unlicensed Waste Disposal and Recovery Activity) Regulations 2008, local authorities are obliged to identify and register by 30 June 2009 all closed unlicensed landfills which were operated by them during the period 15 July 1977 to 27 March 1997, when EU relevant requirements were given full effect in Ireland through the waste licensing system now operated by the EPA.My Department understands from the EPA that all local authorities have complied with this registration requirement.  A total of 315 sites have been identified as coming within the remit of these Regulations and 278 or 88% have been risk assessed. Of these, 57 sites are classified High Risk, 93 Medium Risk and 128 Low Risk. When other sites, such as illegal sites, private sites and pre-1977 sites are taken into account, the overall number of sites involved is 498.  Details of the sites involved may be obtained from the individual local authority registers.

Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the National Broadband Scheme areas.  A key part of the scheme will be to confirm that the premises in question cannot obtain a broadband service.  In a fully liberalised market it is essential to intervene only where the market is unable to provide a service and the Department will be consulting fully with the existing service providers in this respect.  The scheme will be available for applications on an individual basis.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available when the scheme is launched.

The Deputy will be aware of the campaign earlier this year designed to encourage farmers to map all ineligible areas on their farms and to submit such maps to my Department for digitising. The rules of the Scheme have always been very clear as to which areas are ineligible and, while, the majority of farmers had been making sufficient allowances for such areas in their claims, they had not submitted the necessary maps to my Department to allow the areas in question be mapped onto my Department's land parcel database. Because of this, we were potentially seriously exposed to significant EU sanctions, as there is a real expectation on the part of EU auditors that such land databases should accurately reflect the position on the ground. The following table, outing the level of payments made to date, reflects the degree to which digitising is required in each county. Every effort is being made and will continue to be made to expedite payments and, to this end, additional resources have been made available, both within my Department and also to the digitising contractor.CountyApplied 2010Paid 2010%Carlow76660078.33Cavan4,8073,98182.82Clare6,0764,99182.14Cork6,9415,46078.66Donegal8,5296,10971.63Dublin1359167.41Galway12,2199,37376.71Kerry7,6925,84075.92Kildare51839275.68Kilkenny1,7841,41179.09Laois1,6951,40983.13Leitrim3,3942,66878.61Limerick2,9332,38381.25Longford2,4041,97482.11Louth81657470.34Mayo11,3958,42973.97Meath1,3301,09182.03Monaghan4,0763,34382.02Offaly2,4231,97081.30Roscommon5,8364,66980.00Sligo4,0913,31380.98Tipperary4,4623,61681.04Waterford1,4521,20082.64Westmeath2,5532,14984.18Wexford1,5161,07470.84Wicklow1,7701,31074.01Totals101,61379,42078.16

The scheme for the Licensing of Traditional Pot Fishing Boats in the Irish Inshore Fleet was administered by BIM on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The Salmon Hardship Scheme came under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and was administered by BIM.  BIM is an independent statutory agency and hence the internal financial management is a matter for the Board exclusively, in which the Minister does not have a role.  However, the Department has forwarded the request to BIM for its consideration and for a direct reply to the Deputy.The Department has recently had a request for the same information in relation to these schemes, including the Lost at Sea Scheme, from a member of the family involved in the Ombudsman's investigation.  All aspects of that scheme, including the matter of its advertising and promulgation, have already been exhaustively examined by the Ombudsman, by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and most recently by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Committee's final report is awaited and, in the circumstances, the Department has written to the person concerned to advise that it is not prepared to open up a separate correspondence in relation to the matter.

The Forfás Annual Competitiveness Report 2010 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation, the time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.The work to reduce red tape in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts. The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business.  The Group has processed thirty specific red tape issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on a further thirty-eight items.  To date total annual business savings of over €20m have been achieved by the Group.  In addition, an Inter-Departmental Group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, coordinates the measurement and 25% reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognised Standard Cost Model.To progress the implementation of the Government's target to reduce the burden of red tape on business by 25% by 2012, earlier this year my colleague, Minister for State, Billy Kelleher launched two workshops in the area of Company Law and Employment Law to hear directly from business their ideas to reduce the administrative burden.  These workshops, which were held in May and June, were attended by representatives from business, the professions and local enterprise boards. The issues raised included matters relating to returns to the Companies Registration Office, keeping of accounts, the Organisation of  Working Time Act and various aspects of the written statement of Terms of Employment.In line with the overall approach to administrative burden reduction adopted by Government, the aim of the workshops was to identify the best ideas for streamlining the paperwork and information flow that arises from regulation, but without undermining any of the protections afforded by the legislation.  The suggestions made at these workshops are being considered in the context of developing simplification plans for administrative burden reduction in these areas.  The simplification plans will be considered by the High Level Group on Business Regulation later this year.  It is intended to hold a workshop focusing on Health and Safety Legislation in the coming weeks.

The inability to pay mechanism under the National Minimum Wage Act was designed to ensure a balance between a mechanism to provide relief to employers in difficulty on the one hand and ensuring that the minimum wage itself is not eroded on the other hand.  While I am open to views on the practicality of the mechanism, my priority at present is to seek to introduce an inability to pay mechanism in EROs and REAs, as these are in sectors with generally higher rates than the national minimum wage.

Funding allocations to partnerships/local development companies under the LDCP are made by Pobal, which manages the programme on behalf of my Department. Allocations are based on a number of factors, including the size/population of the catchment areas of the companies, the proposed annual programme of activity of each company, the deprivation index for the catchment areas and the available funding for the year. In addition, the indicative allocations for 2010 took account of concentrated levels of urban disadvantage in the catchment areas of urban partnership companies.Details in respect of funding provided to partnerships/local development companies for 2009 and from January to June 2010 are set out in Tables 1-2 below. Details are being collated in respect of the number of persons employed in such companies and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.With regard to community development projects (CDPs), my Department typically provided funding to meet the salary costs of up to 2 full-time equivalent staff and certain overheads costs associated with the running of the projects. In 2009, funding of the order of €19.8m was provided to some 180 CDPs and groups, in which approximately 350 core staff (full-time equivalents) were employed. In 2010, some 160 CDPs and groups are being funded under the LCDP. Expenditure for January-June 2010 was approximately €11.8m, while the estimated annualised cost is of the order of €19m. The number of core staff (full-time equivalents) employed by these groups in 2010 is approximately 290.Details in respect of CDP funding for 2010 to date are set out in Table 3 below:Name of company*€Avondhu/Blackwater Partnership Limited527,154Ballyfermot Partnership Limited933,730Ballyhoura Community Partnership670,342Ballymun Partnership Limited980,233Blanchardstown Area Partnership924,488Bray Partnership976,428Breffni Integrated Development Limited857,072Canal Communities Partnership870,047Carlow County Development Partnership Limited664,640Cill Dara Ar Aghaidh Teo1,180,181Clare Local Development Company945,489CLPN Area Partnership1,238,450Comhair Chathair Chorcaí1,256,857Comhar na nOileán Teo40,000County Kilkenny Leader Partnership Ltd.731,939County Wicklow Community Partnership658,288Donegal Local Development Company1,192,687Dodder Valley Partnership1,394,560Dublin Inner City Partnership1,187,685Fingal Leader Partnership429,793Tolka Area Partnership1,150,692Tolka Area Partnership — Provision for Extension Funds100,000Forum160,000Galway City Partnership882,045Galway Rural Development Company1,201,091Inishowen Area Based Company875,632IRD Duhallow570,658KWCD Partnership1,085,027Laois Partnership Company696,218Leitrim Integrated Development Company Ltd.873,320Longford Community Resources Ltd.847,666Louth LEADER Partnership1,880,975Mayo North East Leader948,714Meath Partnership340,156Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta1,993,262Monaghan Integrated Development Company911,789North & East Kerry Leader Partnership Teo1,643,073North Tipperary Integrated Local Development Body623,092Northside Partnership1,229,648Offaly Integrated Local Development Company Ltd.1,019,852PAUL Partnership Limerick1,420,069Rathmines Pembroke Community Partnership415,943Roscommon Integrated Local Development Body874,717SECAD (East Cork Area Development)509,901Sligo Leader Partnership Company828,852South Kerry Development Partnership902,051South Tipperary Integrated Local Development Body447,540South West Mayo Development188,239Southside Partnership1,113,976Waterford Area Partnership923,730Waterford Leader Partnership Ltd.374,289West Cork Integrated Development Body427,629West Limerick Resources Ltd.836,260Westmeath Community Development1,117,987Wexford Integrated Local Development Body2,150,837Total49,224,990*Revised drawdown allocations following April 2009 Supplementary Budget.Name of companyJanuary to June€Avondhu/Blackwater Partnership Ltd.184,566Ballyfermot Partnership302,207Ballyhoura Development Ltd.249,101Ballymun Partnership387,094Blanchardstown Area Partnership362,417Bray Partnership450,387Breffni Integrated Ltd.299,041Canal Communities Partnership343,850Carlow County Development Partnership236,606Cill Dara Ar Aghaidh Teoranta370,752Clare Local Development348,523Clondalkin Partnership525,055Comhar Chathair Chorcaí Teo425,232Comhar na nOileán Teo11,745County Kilkenny LEADER Partnership272,686County Sligo Leader Partnership309,662County Wicklow Community Partnership271,878Dodder Valley Partnership Ltd.514,826Donegal Local Development Co.308,144Dublin Inner City Partnership122,669Fingal LEADER Partnership Company204,081Finglas/Cabra Partnership459,254Forum120,023Galway City Partnership371,903Galway Rural Development Company364,763Inishowen Development Partnership335,374IRD Duhallow196,808Laois Community & Enterprise D226,015Leitrim Integrated Development Co.313,255Longford Community Resources Ltd220,806Louth Leader Partnership806,878Mayo North East Leader Partner247,747Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta743,956Monaghan Integrated Development330,279North & East Kerry Leader Partnership624,170North Tipperary Leadership Partnership180,367Northside Partnership455,295Offaly Integrated Local Development Company Ltd.352,381PAUL (Limerick) Partnership596,112Rathmines Information & Community Services161,784Rathmines Pembroke Community Partnership117,632Roscommon Integrated Development Company Limited342,508South & East Cork Area Development Ltd153,598South Kerry Development Partnership286,078South Tipperary Development Company185,957South West Mayo Development Company108,433Southside Partnership431,907Waterford Area Partnership351,807Waterford Leader Partnership150,530West Cork Development Partnership161,049West Limerick Rescouces Ltd288,882Westmeath Community Development Lim399,193Wexford Local Development667,971Total17,253,237Community Development ProjectJanuary to June€Access 2000 — Waterford Women’s Centre41,440.67Access 2000 (Wexford ) Ltd.40,174.35Longford Acorn38,332.57Action Inishowen35,933.07Áit na nDaoine C.D.P.43,885.47An Cosán, The Shanty Educ.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-07 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The main objectives of the Rural Development Programme are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy, and the individual measures under the Programme, including indicative allocations, are as follows:Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families —   €16.66m;Support for business creation and development — €48.26m;Encouragement of tourism activities — €45.4m;Basic services for the economy and rural population — €49.61m;Village renewal and development — €54.2m;Conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage — €51.7m;Training and information on adapted and new skills — €29.45m; andImplementing co-operation projects  — €10.7m.I am pleased with the progress to date under the RDP, which continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities since it started in 2009. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times, and there is no question of funds being diverted away from the RDP.The RDP currently has registered project activity of €71 million, with almost €30 million at an advanced stage of development. Expenditure to date amounts to almost €47 million, which includes funding for a diverse range of projects from support for micro-enterprise in rural areas to the build and maintenance of community infrastructure and the provision of training in a variety of disciplines for rural dwellers. I am confident that all of the activity funded under the RDP to date is contributing to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long-term job opportunities in rural areas.My Department and I will be working closely with Minister Batt O'Keeffe and his Department in the coming months to promote increased co-operation between LAGs and County Enterprise Boards in order to ensure that we maximise the impact of all of the funding available and fully support enterprise and job creation in rural areas.I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with rural communities through their LAGs to explore all possible funding opportunities under the RDP.
