I draw everyone's attention to the fact that the House in its wisdom has decided to apply time limits to these contributions. We will start with Deputy Micheál Martin.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I want to raise with the Taoiseach the appalling waiting times and waiting lists for children who wish to access therapy services such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Children from the earliest age do not have access to such therapists. That is the reality of where we are today. For example, Deputies Cowen and Fleming highlighted recently that in counties Laois and Offaly, 400 families with an autistic child cannot access therapy services while 950 children are waiting for occupational therapy in County Laois where the average waiting time is 47 months. A child referred at five years of age, therefore, could be ten before he or she receives treatment. In north Mayo, there are 86 children waiting for therapy services with 60 being high priority. There have been 101 referrals for speech and language therapy but there is no full-time therapist. A number of Members met representatives of Scoil Cara in Cork earlier this week. Its enrolment has gone from approximately 20 children with autism to 60 children. There is no multi-dimensional therapy team in that school. With regard to occupational therapy assessment nationally, more than 5,690 are waiting on under 18 therapy services with in excess of 3,000 waiting for more than a year for such an assessment. The situation is not acceptable and is not tenable. The existing HSE model of progressing disability services for children and young people is a failed model and it is the wrong model in my considered view. I have put this forward for the past 12 months as did my party's education team.In my view the schools should be employing the therapists on school campuses either in one school or in clusters of schools and there should be a holistic multidimensional teams working with teachers and psychologists on the school campus. We are light years away from that; in fact, the opposite is now happening where teams are being taken from the special schools as part of the HSE's reconfiguration of services.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	The bottom line is that we need a fundamental step change in how we provide basic therapy services to children of preschool and school-going age. What has been going on over the past number of years is just not on. The system does not get it. Parents are extremely frustrated at what is going on in terms of getting basic access to vital therapy services because early intervention is the key to a child achieving his or her educational and developmental potential. We are failing as a society to provide that in any meaningful form.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	Will the Taoiseach accept that it is a crisis and that the current model being deployed is wrong?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	First, I accept that this is not a satisfactory situation. The programme for Government recognises that we should be able to deal with this at school level. The Minister was contacted by the Laois-Offaly group in respect of this. The programme for Government commits the Government to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs. Yesterday the Government made a decision to increase the number of special needs assistants to 12,900 but these special needs assistants, while they do a brilliant job, generally impact on the physical needs of children in classes. We have never had an analysis of the outcome in terms of the quality and the impact of those interventions by those people. The vast majority of them do a first-class job. The Government also, as the Deputy is aware, has a proposition and has made a commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio for junior and senior infants by providing smaller classes, which will give an opportunity for teachers to recognise that there may be particular challenges with young people in this regard. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is a dedicated and experienced person in dealing with disabilities and he now has responsibilities for disabilities as a Minister of State. In the past 18 months the roll out of the HSE's Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme has targeted investment of €14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with all disabilities, including children with autism. The key objective is to achieve better access and consistency of service delivery for children and young people with disabilities and to develop a clear path to services regardless of where they live in the country, where they go to school or the nature of the individual difficulties a child may have. I point out also that in the programme for Government we have decided to deal with the question of the use of county boundaries for access to health and social services; that will be reviewed independently - as the Deputy is aware, these matters stop at the county boundary for some reason dating back to the past - to ensure that the most efficient and the most cost effective service is provided to those who need it. As announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, this morning, Wednesday, a new scheme to ensure access to early childhood care and education programmes for young children with disabilities is commencing this September and we will ensure that further development of this initiative follows through. An amount of €4 million has been allocated this year for additional speech and language therapists for this age cohort. It will not deal with the backlog that Deputy Martin pointed out but it is an important start in that regard. An education providing access earlier to children and adults to speech and language therapy makes a vital difference to their future opportunities in life. We want all those opportunities for them.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	It will introduce a new in-school speech and language service creating stronger linkages between parents, teachers and the speech and language therapists.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	It is a very honest satisfactory reply but it is depressing because the Taoiseach answered a whole lot of matters except the question I asked him. I asked him directly about therapists. We need a step change regarding therapists in this country. I did not ask about special needs assistants. That scheme started in 1998 and thousands were employed ever since and there will be annual increases. I am talking about access to speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. We need to get those therapists into the schools and employed on the campus. We need to change the model. The Taoiseach has quoted the progressing disabilities programme to me. With respect to the progressing disabilities programme and policy, in 2014 they announced 275 additional therapists with 88 meant to be speech and language therapists. How many were recruited?It is now 2016 and only 27 have been recruited. We took a step change in 1998 in terms of automatic responses and pupil-teacher ratios and we need a similar step change in terms of access to therapies in our schools. What is going on is a scandal and parents should not be put through any more of it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	Never.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	-----when in fact it might have been much more appropriate if other interventions were made there like speech and language or occupational therapy. The point I am making is that with reduced class sizes for senior and junior infants, with special need assistants where they apply, and with teachers, one can identify at an earlier stage whether a child has a particular difficulty or not.

What I have announced today with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is a new service with increased funding and an extra allocation of €4 million this year to start in September.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	That has nothing to do with what I have asked. It will do nothing in terms of therapies.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	26	I welcomed the Taoiseach's visit last night to Dublin’s north inner city where he met with some of the community and listened to what they had to say. I hope he understands that this was just the first chapter in the consultation that needs to happen between the Government and the people there. He says that those who spoke at the meeting were inspirational and he is right. They are. In fairness, the least the Taoiseach could have done was to visit them. We know that the problems faced by the inner city are not accidental and the Taoiseach must know that too. A lack of opportunity, decent services, homes and decent work are all a direct result of decades of neglect and bad government, including by the Taoiseach’s own Government over the last five years. The Taoiseach has listened and now he must act. The needs are clear. Local people must be front and centre in drafting the terms of reference for the task force and they must be part of it. Teachta McDonald and others are working with the community to bring forward an integrated plan for the regeneration of the north inner city. It is also important to recognise that the problems there are not unique. There are countless other communities in the State and across the island that face the same issues of social deprivation, economic disadvantage and the lack of opportunity. If the Taoiseach is to deliver for these citizens and to deliver on the rhetoric of last night, his starting point must be the reality that the Government is not geared to eradicating social and economic disadvantage. Fine Gael is not geared towards ending inequality and poverty. It is their policies and the policies of Fianna Fáil which have created a deeply unequal society.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	28	The North Wall Community Association's chairperson, Gerry Fay, has said that three decades of neglect have created social apartheid for people in his community. He spoke of a litany of broken promises over the last 30 years. Results count. Ní sheasann mála folamh. I want the Taoiseach to commit today to a long-term, resourced and integrated strategy to address poverty, drug addiction, educational opportunity, decent work and homes for the inspirational people of Dublin’s north inner city. I then want him to take that model into every disadvantaged community in the State from Tallaght to Finglas and Ballyfermot, from Muirhevnamore to Cox’s Demesne and from Knocknaheeny to Moyross. That is the challenge the Taoiseach faces today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	29	It is and I am sorry that Deputy Adams has taken a political line on this. I reject his assertion that the party I lead is not geared to deal with social disadvantage. I also reject the assertion he makes that the Government is not geared to deal with it. I was very pleased to see all of the public representatives who were there last night who chose to listen to the people and the community leaders in the north inner city. I found the meeting very constructive and positive from all of the work that is going on there. The point was made that people certainly have a feeling of a divide between those who make decisions and those who have to live in the community of the north inner city.We heard the stories of isolation, fear and the need for visibility on the streets of members of An Garda Síochána and the facilities it required. We heard the stories of what needed to happen about drugs and drug treatment, the provision of injection rooms and the carrying of drugs by couriers from place to place. We heard all of those stories from real people. I intend to meet the public representatives on Monday to hear their priorities. In response to Deputy Gerry Adams, I am not going to make a political football out of this issue. I am not because the issues that need to be addressed in the north inner city are replicated in other places around the country. The decision makers here – the Government – using a strong and growing economy, need to invest in areas that were neglected. What did they say last night? They said it was the small things - the broken panes of glass, the unpainted signs, the unkempt footpaths, the inability of children to cross the street safely - that impacted on ordinary people's lives.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	39	A combination is needed in terms of a response. It is a task force to deal with the north inner city as a model to be used in any other part of the country. The point made was that a scheme in south-west Cork was not the same as the scheme needed in the north inner city. I believe that and intend to follow through on the commitments made and the challenge I undertook as Head of Government to deal with the many problems, some of them small, some of them great, in the north inner city.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	40	The Taoiseach takes exception to what I said but then goes on to say there is "certainly a feeling of a divide" between the people living in the area and those who take decisions. There is a feeling? It is the reality. Poverty is not an accident. Inequality is not an accident. It took brutal murders committed by criminal gangs to get the Taoiseach to acknowledge the inequalities faced by the community that he visited last night. One must name the problem and then deliver solutions. Sinn Féin will actively support the Government in doing so. I know the inner city well. I was there 30 years ago standing with the community against the drug barons. Some of the community activists the Taoiseach met last night were then arguing for the same measures for which they are now arguing. They have been let down time and again, but they have remained resilient, sound and inspirational. Countless citizens would have been lost or have had no hope were it not for their efforts. The majority of these citizens have never let themselves, their families or Ireland down, but the political system has let them down.

It is an area where the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has pointed to the extent of neglect and non-investment for many years. Many of the problems about which I heard last night were small by their nature, but they were important. They are the ones people want to see being dealt with in the first instance and I intend to follow through on them as non-party, non-individual political issues. This is about the people living in these communities. It is about investment by Government agencies and Departments to give people there a better quality of life. They want to be able to walk the streets without fear. They want their children to have an opportunity to go to school. They want to see opportunities for young people to avail of training apprenticeships and find jobs. They want to be able to take that road towards finding a better opportunity-----

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	48	The report of Women’s Aid, published today, highlights the fact that in 2015 the national domestic abuse service received 16,375 disclosures of domestic abuse against women and 5,966 disclosures of child abuse.That is a total of 22,341 abuse disclosures. These figures will shock not only those of us in this Chamber but also everybody across the country. Across Ireland, women have been choked, scalded, strangled, punched, spat at, cut with knives and hit with golf clubs. These are acts of barbarism. Over the past 20 years, 211 women have been murdered in Ireland, almost half at the hands of people using their bare hands. In 2015 in Ireland, far too many women lived in fear. That continues this year. The women live in fear of physical and psychological abuse and they fear for their children. As a House, we must put an end to that. We clearly need to do more to protect women in the home and women in relationships. Will the Taoiseach give a clear timeline to the House for the enactment of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill? Will he agree to amend that draft legislation to allow for young women in dating relationships who are not living with their partners to receive the same protection as envisaged for cohabiting couples under that draft legislation? Given the small amount of additional money required, will the Taoiseach agree now to extend funding for the 24/7 national freephone helpline in recognition of the real issues that have been highlighted today in the Women’s Aid report?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	49	What Deputy Brendan Howlin has raised here is a litany of shame and cowardice on the part of those who inflict violence on women. Those who do so are not macho and should be ashamed of themselves because they bring shame on our country. We should have the opportunity to have the report debated here in the House. The Tánaiste was at the launch of the report this morning. I have every sympathy with Deputy Howlin's proposal for an amendment so protection may be given to victims of this kind of crime. We have set out a range of priorities for legislation. Some are quite immediate in terms of issues I have already addressed. I will advise Deputy Howlin on the programme for legislating in respect of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill. On the Deputy's request in respect of coverage for the 24/7 helpline, it seems that it should, of course, be available. I do not know the costs involved but I am sure a case could be made that would bring it about. If the making of a call would protect one person fearing for her life, the helpline will have to be considered. The report reflects a hidden, dark Ireland that needs to be dealt with and exposed. Those who inflict the kind of brutality in question on womenfolk should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	50	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. It is important that this report be debated in the House. Perhaps the Whips will set time aside in the next week or two weeks for that to happen. However, we also need to follow through with practical proposals. I look forward to hearing the timeline for the enactment of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill, the heads of which were approved last year. If we could reach a collective agreement to seek to make progress on it before the end of this session, the Taoiseach might indicate his willingness to agree to the proposal. With regard to support for Women’s Aid, the very least this House can do is ensure women who are vulnerable have some mechanism to reach out on a 24-hour basis.I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that whatever resources are required to make such a service available are provided without delay.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	51	I will follow up on that issue immediately. In regard to the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill, the new arrangement that kicks in next week will allow Ministers to answer individually in respect of legislation that falls within their responsibility. In the meantime, I will advise the Deputy on the progress made on the Bill. In regard to having a debate in the House, the Whip has responsibility for 60% of business and the business committee has responsibility for the remainder. However, I am sure we can find an opportunity to debate a report of such profound implications for women all over the country as it needs to be debated.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	52	While I welcome and respect the right of the Labour Party to raise the issues raised by Deputy Howlin, it seems to have forgotten that it was in power for the past five years. The abuse of women did not start today or yesterday. I wish to press the immediate issue of the exorbitant increase in waste charges that will come into effect on 1 July. Questions have been submitted to the Government on this issue, which was also raised last week and this week in the House. How can the Government stand over these charges and the sharp practices in which waste companies are engaged? Under the polluter pays principle, the less waste a householder sends to landfill, the less he or she pays. What we are seeing, however, is that exactly the opposite is the case and people are incensed, anxious and angry. Greyhound's current service charge of €59.95 is set to increase to €169 per annum. This charge must be paid before a bin is lifted. The company will charge 35 cents per kilogram of black bin waste and 23 cents per kilogram of brown bin waste. The service charge imposed by Thorntons is set to increase from €50 to €104, while its rates for black and grey bin waste will be similar to those charged by Greyhound. The Government introduced a minimum mandatory fee of 11 cents per kilogram for black bin waste and 6 cents per kilogram of brown bin waste and yet the waste companies are charging the prices to which I referred. What will these charges mean for a family? In the case of Thorntons, the cost of having a brown bin weighing 40 kg collected will increase from €6.40 to €8, while the collection of a black bin will increase from €9.90 to €10.50 for 30 kg of waste and €14 for 40 kg of waste. Disabled people who are incontinent and use nappies will have to pay the same price as everyone else. Under the new charges, a household which has a black bin collected 26 times per annum will pay €364 compared to €267 currently.  The Government lauded the increase of €3 per week in the old age pension last year. Most pensioners with private pensions had these cut by at least 80 cents. Local authority rents also increased and the new waste charges will wipe out the remainder of the increase. For ordinary people, the recovery means more of the same austerity. The Government argues that the new waste charging regime will result in greater competition. Waste disposal is a cartel in which there is no competition. Competition has meant increasing waste charges. I intended to make a few points about the companies involved in the industry but I will return to that issue.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	54	The increases in waste charges affect a large number of individuals and households. The Government should remember that the last time it introduced charges that affected most households was when it imposed water charges. People are incensed about the increases in waste charges and they will react to them. One of the e-mails I have received on the issue states that ordinary householders will be ripped off by the waste companies if something is not done quickly. The Government must regulate this issue by imposing a cap on annual charges with immediate effect.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	55	Deputy Joan Collins stated that a cartel operates among the collectors of bins. That would be a criminal offence. If evidence exists that a cartel operates in respect of bin charges and the collection of bins, it would be a matter for investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. The theory and spirit behind the legislation drafted on this issue was that it would not be a new charge in respect of waste being collected but would be a new way of thinking about how people could reduce their charges by using brown and green bins to a greater extent for recyclables, food and so on. The Minister for housing, local government and planning has been perfectly clear.I am monitoring the position very carefully. The spirit of the legislation is to allow people to think differently about the waste put in bins. The charges set were as follows: 11 cent for a black bin of residual waste and 6 cent for a brown bin of organic waste. The Minister decided there would be a zero cent charge in the case of green bins. Given the concern expressed and because of the fact that numerous bin companies are operating in the greater Dublin area, the position is being monitored carefully by the Minister. The legislation was set in such a way that people would understand clearly that better use of the brown and green bins would reduce the amount to be placed in the black bin and that, therefore, charges should not rise. The position is being monitored carefully by the Minister.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	56	The Taoiseach referred to the spirit of the legislation. However, this concerns multinational and profit-making companies and it does not happen that way, as is evident in this case. Without putting out a bin, there is an increase from €59.95 to €169 per annum. That is not the spirit of recycling. This is relevant for Thorntons. It has been reported in the media today that families are finding themselves subject to a 75% increase in waste charges calculated over one year. That is not in the spirit of recycling. The Taoiseach should initiate an investigation into the cartels. For example, if people move from Greyhound to Thorntons, they are charged a registration fee of €40. If they want to move to a bin company which operates outside the areas in which these companies generally work - for example, Thorntons and Greyhound operate in my area - they cannot get another to come in. Another company will not come into an area to collect ten bins. It will only do so if it will have a monopoly or enough bins to collect in a given area. People are incensed about this issue. I have organised public meetings in Drimnagh, Ballyfermot and Crumlin in the coming two weeks and I invite my fellow Deputies to join in them.

As we all know, this country and companies operating here are at the centre of that controversy. This is specifically directed at multinationals. I find it extraordinary that an all-party committee agreed that the matter should be decided on in the Dáil without debate. I also find it extraordinary that there is not a bigger appetite for a longer and more substantial debate on the matter. Essentially, we are evoking the principle of subsidiarity to prevent an effort to deal with aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals.

She made the point that when the committee had considered the proposal, it had heard evidence from officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and reviewed submissions from various stakeholders. It formed the view that the proposal did not comply with the principle of subsidiarity and summarised its reasons for forming that view. Under Standing Order 114, when a committee drafts a reasoned opinion, it submits it to the Dáil by way of a report and the Chairman tables a motion which shall be given priority on the Order Paper in accordance with Standing Order 30. Such motions are generally decided without debate, but a 40-minute debate has been arranged on this occasion on foot of the views expressed by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett. I ask the Deputy to accept this.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	101	The programme for Government contains commitments on home help hours and packages for carers. Information released to Fianna Fáil has revealed that the average processing time of applications for carer's benefit and carer's allowance is over 18 weeks and that the appeals process can take a further 23 weeks. This means that carers may have to wait for more than nine months before they receive payments. I suggest that in National Carers Week the Government needs to reaffirm its commitment to carers. Delays in processing applications can cause additional stress for carers who are already under immense pressure because of their caring roles. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government's commitment to carers will be realised? In particular, will he confirm that there will be a dramatic reduction in waiting times in the processing of applications for carer's benefit and carer's allowance? The programme for Government also contains a commitment to address the future sustainability of rural GP practices. We have been warning about this for a long time. We have spoken about the lack of services in rural Ireland in the past five years. We have highlighted the crisis that is developing in general practice in many rural areas. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine the use of tax instruments and other incentives. The programme provides that "the HSE will be mandated to employ GPs on a salaried basis where needed".Will the Taoiseach confirm if work has begun on these tax incentives? Has the HSE been mandated to employ salaried GPs in areas such as Bansha, west Clare and other rural communities? I refer to Deputy Howlin's comments earlier and the heads of the domestic violence Bill which were published last July. What is the scheduling for this Bill? The health information and patient safety Bill has been on various legislative programmes for more than a decade. What is remarkable about it is that it has made it every time on to the schedule. Its durability and resilience is due to the consistency of some official in the Department of Health. However, it never has made it beyond being listed. Will this legislation be published before the summer recess? What is the story with it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	102	The health information and patient safety Bill will not be published before the summer recess but will go for pre-legislative scrutiny shortly. There are several priority Bills in respect of water, paternity payments, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and several other matters I would like to get cleared before the summer period. In respect of the carers and the issue of appeals, the Minister is working to reduce the appeal time. If an appeal is successful, it is obviously backdated. The carer’s support grant has been fully restored, a change from the cut in previous years. The programme for Government commitment in respect of the rural GP practices is a priority for the new Minister for Health and he is beginning work on this. There has not been an overall change of contract in this respect for more than 40 years. It is a priority for the Minister who will work with GPs in respect of that. We will report progress in due course.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	103	I welcome the Taoiseach's visit to the University of Ulster and to Belfast on Monday in support of the campaign against Brexit. Notwithstanding the news that Mr. Cameron has decided to pull out of an event with the Taoiseach, I understand he will be spending several days in the north of England and Scotland. There are only nine days left before the vote takes place. Will the Taoiseach or other Ministers visit the North before then? The North being pulled out of the EU is bad for all of the island. While Sinn Féin is critical of the European Union, enough difficulties are created by partition and we do not need a part of this island inside the EU with another part outside. However, in the event the “Leave” side wins, has the Government a plan B to minimise any disruption? If there is a Brexit, will the Taoiseach support the democratic imperative of a Border poll to provide Irish citizens with the right to vote for an end to partition and for an all-island approach to the EU? The programme for Government sets the ambitious target of wanting this State to be recognised as one of the cleanest and safest environments in the world. How does this laudable objective square with the significant increase in bin charges that most households now face? Thorntons has replaced its €40 a year standing charge with a weekly €2 service charge, meaning its customers will now have to pay €104 a year in service charges, on top of increased costs for lifting brown and black bins.

Citizens and households have to sign up for a 12-month contract and these new measures kick in on 1 July. There is an urgency about this. It will inevitably lead to an increase in illegal dumping, a point the Taoiseach would acknowledge. Has the Government considered urgent action such as exemptions for households, especially those with special needs? Will these be in place by 1 July?

After the discussions I had with people in Belfast during the week, there is evidence of little activity from the political parties on the ground in explaining to people what this referendum is about and the consequences for Northern Ireland.I am glad the Deputy supports the campaign for people to remain members of the European Union because of its clear implications for the economy and, therefore, the livelihood and opportunities for people in Northern Ireland. Nobody wants to see a return to a hard Border but, much as we would not want that to happen, if the British electorate, including Northern Ireland, were to vote to leave, it would be very difficult to continue on as we were before. While it would not be our wish to have a return to that situation, it is difficult to envisage a situation where some conditions or controls were not applied. I hope the people, on 23 June, vote in their wisdom to stay members of the European Union. That is obviously not within our control, although, as the Deputy has often pointed out, we are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and we have a specific vested interest in the Irish communities there. In addition, there are 200,000 Irish jobs here and a €1.2 billion trade across the Irish Sea every week. Those who are in business in Ireland and who export through Britain say that if an exit vote were to take place, it would do serious damage to competitiveness, with delays, inefficiency and increased costs for Irish business.

It is a matter for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and the Minister and his officials have been dealing with the issue of those who have disabilities and particular challenges. Let me repeat that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is monitoring this situation very closely.

I raised this matter yesterday and I asked the Taoiseach, if he was not in a position to brief the House overtly in regard to plans that might be being worked on currently by senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and elsewhere in regard to this matter, then he might at least ensure leaders in opposition were fully briefed on the matter to ensure there would be a clear strategy to be implemented immediately by this country should the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union. With regard to legislation, I raised last week with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the issue of the paternity leave Bill. I was told it would go to the Cabinet this week. Has the paternity leave Bill been approved, when will it be published and is it still the Government's intention that the new paternity leave arrangements will be implemented for September?

I understand the Minister for Education and Skills is to sign a statutory instrument by the end of this week that essentially closes off the possibility of level 8, Montessori trained teachers being able to work, as they have until now, within the State system in special schools. These teachers are trained in St. Nicholas Montessori College in my constituency and in the Cork Institute of Technology. There was a recognition to date that even though they did not have a bachelor of education qualification, their level 8 qualification would allow them to work in the State system and to be approved by the Teaching Council to do so in the specific area of special education, which is where their training is directed.If the statutory instrument is signed I am told this career option for all of these highly qualified people trained to teach in the area of special needs will be closed off. They are asking that the statutory instrument is not signed. Will the Taoiseach provide a response on this? Will he ask the Minister for Education and Skills to do something about it? It is a very time-sensitive issue.

When will the legislation be published? When does the Taoiseach expect it to be taken? On the issue of waste charges, this will be the third day in a row on which I have asked the Taoiseach about regulations for the new charging regime. It may well be the case the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a view on what is happening and the allegation of a cartel operating, but it falls to the Minister with responsibility for the environment to make regulations to reverse the regulations the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, introduced to allow for charging for green bins. These new regulations need to be signed, at which point would it not make sense for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to make regulations, as he is required to do under law-----

This is a very serious issue. Under the health (miscellaneous provisions) (No. 2) Bill, is the Taoiseach aware that only 32 caseworkers in the entire country deal with this area and 13,000 cases have been referred to them? It is a huge area that needs to be addressed. It is a very sensitive and sad area. Deputy Howlin spoke about another area of abuse earlier. Only 32 staff are employed. They cannot get next nor near the amount of referrals they have.

The heads were agreed some time ago. There is a voluntary code to which most of the voluntary housing associations are signed up. However, this is important in the context of the provision of housing because voluntary housing associations have the capacity to provide a significant number of houses. If they had a regulatory code, it would make it easier for them to borrow in order to construct houses, so this is important in the context of the debate regarding the provision of housing, which is very lively at the moment. I ask the Taoiseach that the Bill be published as soon as possible.

This is a Bill to amend the Companies Act 2014 to hold a company officer or officers acting on behalf of a corporate body personally liable where a breach of employment law is committed. It would lift the "corporate veil" whereby company officers or directors can separate the legal personality of a company from their legal responsibilities to their employees. The Clerys workers, among many others, were left high and dry, while employers can hide behind company law. While the Bill is not the only solution, it is one of a number of solutions advocated to deal with the issue.

In the new programme for a partnership Government the Government stated its intention to reform Seanad Éireann. We are committed to pursuing implementation of the report of the working group on Seanad Reform which was chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning. The report was published last year. With the associated draft Bill and the explanatory memorandum prepared for the group, it is available on the Department's website. I welcomed its publication and indicated that there needed to be a public and political discussion and consultation on it. To that end, I requested that the working group make a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad. On 5 May and 8 July 2015 statements on the report were made in Seanad Éireann, with the chairman of the working group and former Senator Joe O'Toole, a member of the group, in attendance. Last July I met Opposition leaders to discuss the report's content. Arising from the meeting, I gave a commitment to have a debate in the Dáil on the working group's report. Although this did not prove possible in the previous Dáil, it is still my intention that the debate take place as soon as possible. A Dáil debate should be the first step in the reform process. In February 2014 the then Government presented a package of proposals on Seanad reform to the then Leader of the Seanad for submission to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges. In February 2014 the general scheme of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill was published for consultation. The purpose of the Bill was to enable implementation of the 1979 constitutional amendment to extend the Seanad franchise to graduates of higher education institutes in the State that did not form part of the Seanad universities constituencies. The general scheme was presented in the Seanad for discussion in March 2014 and at the end of the previous Dáil a revised general scheme was under consideration by the then Government. It would need to be considered in the light of the Government's commitment to Seanad reform in A Programme for a Partnership Government. I am very supportive of the pursuit of implementation of the Manning report and have advised the new Leader of the Seanad, Senator Jerry Buttimer, that it should be a priority of his.I understand a number of Senators have also tabled a Bill to implement the Manning report. It is important that there be an implementation group to advise Senators on their choices and options about certain matters relevant to it.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	162	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the issue of Seanad reform has not been tackled and that it has been on the political agenda for as long as the Seanad has existed. There have been 12 reports on Seanad reform and following the McNulty debacle, as the Taoiseach outlined, the Seanad reform working group was established by him, but its report has not been acted on. We did not even get to debate it during the previous term. The Taoiseach mentioned the need to put together an implementation group and Sinn Féin Seanadóirí and Independents have taken an initiative to push Seanad reform to the top of the political agenda. This is about the setting up of a committee on Seanad political reform which would be strictly time limited to four weeks and address the role of a reformed Seanad, its powers and functions, any legislative change that might be needed and how the Seanad should conduct its business. The notion is that it would deal with submissions from any Member or group and with the Manning report. It is a way of doing it coming from Seanadóirí. Will the Taoiseach support this initiative and embrace the proposal?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	163	I am very supportive of the report produced by Dr. Manning and a number of others from different parties on Seanad reform. I spoke to Dr. Manning recently and he is prepared to work with an implementation group that would be available to advise Senators on the technical aspects of the report. I commend the Seanadóirí from the Sinn Féin Party for their efforts, but ultimately this is a matter for all Senators and I am supportive of the Manning report being implemented. I am not sure what their response will be. It is a new Seanad with a diverse range of opinions, but having gone through the attempt to abolish the House and having had the people say, "We want the Seanad retained," I am supportive of it being reformed. The Manning report provides a range of opportunities to engage in such reform. I expect the proposal from the Sinn Féin Senators to feed into this. Obviously, I spoke to the Leader of the Seanad and that House will have a debate on the matter in the near future.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	164	Of course, the Leader of the Seanad was a determined and committed advocate of its abolition; therefore, I will not hold my breath in terms of his new zeal to reform the House. However, it is not a matter for the Seanad alone; it is a matter for the entire Oireachtas but this House, in particular, because legislation would have to be passed. I would like the Taoiseach to clarify, as he said in his reply, that, in essence, he is now in favour of the Manning report because when we met as party leaders during the previous term, I cannot recollect him committing to direct franchise, for example, whereby the people would elect Senators. That is the fundamental change that needs to occur. There are other recommendations made in the report which was drawn up on the basis that they would not require a constitutional amendment. That was an unnecessary constraint, but I was prepared to work with it. The public wants the Seanad to be reformed. Seanad reform is of equal importance to Dáil reform that has occurred in giving greater authority to Members and greater opportunities to participate in rebalancing the power axis between the Executive and the Parliament. The Seanad is part of this, but for it to have legitimacy into the future, it needs a direct electoral franchise, as recommended in the Manning report, using different models. Is the Taoiseach saying he is committed to implementation of the report? Is it his view that an Oireachtas all-party implementation group should be established with a view to implementing the Manning report recommendations? Is that the pathway we are on or is he suggesting it is just a Seanad committee that will be formed? That would not be satisfactory and might delay matters even more. If all the leaders of the political parties and groupings were to sign up to the Manning report - all of us would be compromising to some degree - the logical follow through would be implementation and that would mean working through the legislative framework and the wherewithal required. The implementation group should have a secretariat and receive legislative advice to make this a reality in order that within this Dáil timeframe we could put in place and pass the legislation that would mean a different Seanad the next time we have a general election or a different modality for electing Members of the Seanad. That should be our target and I seek clarity on whether that is what the Taoiseach is suggesting.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	166	I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Obviously, we campaigned for abolition of the Seanad, but we did not win that referendum; the people voted to retain it. When they look at the Seanad today, full of former Deputies who failed to be re-elected to this House, many of whom said they would never enter the Seanad if they failed to be re-elected, most of them, including those who voted to retain the House, would say, "That is not what we voted for." They voted for a Seanad that does not exist; they voted for a reformed, much more democratic House. Our position remains the same. We think Upper Houses are inherently undemocratic and designed to act as a conservatising block on progressive change. However, we would favour a significantly reformed Seanad. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a problem with the Manning report, which is, as Deputy Micheál Martin mentioned, that it remains within the framework of the Constitution? The Constitution is a fundamental problem. If its framework is accepted, the elitism of six university seats is accepted. They can be divided up in a way that is slightly less elitist than is the case, but that still means that 16% of the population have the right to an additional vote in the Seanad election by virtue of the fact that they attended university. That is inherently elitist and undemocratic. Does the Taoiseach not recognise the problem with this? Second, if we stick within the framework of the Constitution, the Taoiseach's nominees remain. Whatever about 16% of the population having an additional vote, in this case, one person, who happens to be the Taoiseach, appoints 11 people, many of whom could be from the same category of failed election candidates or election candidates who did not put their names forward. Does the Taoiseach agree that he needs to move beyond the bounds of the Manning report and the Constitution to ensure reform and democratisation?

Deputy Micheál Martin has been direct in his question. It is a matter for the Oireachtas and if the leaders of the parties in this House are prepared to sign up to it, the programme for Government states clearly that we will pursue implementation of the report as a priority. I have spoken to the Leader of the Seanad who will work towards its implementation. Deputy Micheál Martin mentioned an implementation group comprising Members of the Oireachtas or of the Seanad only.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	169	That is positive because an interim implementation group overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach was originally proposed in the report.I think the Deputy's proposal is a better idea. If the group comprised members of the parties in the Dáil and the Seanad, with access to independent IT experts or independent legal experts, and representatives from the various Departments, the process could move faster. That is probably a better idea. To deal with elements of the Constitution in so far as the Seanad is concerned, we probably will not see a scale of reform that would be envisaged here. As the Deputy is aware, the report recommended an interim establishment body. It recommended a majority of seats to be elected by popular vote in a one-person, one-vote system, that the principle would be extended to include Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and those living overseas who hold a valid Irish passport, a provision for online registration of voters and the downloading of ballot papers. People approached me in America recently about the developments that have taken place in authentication and validation of this particular system. The report also recommended a far greater role for the Seanad in scrutiny, amendment and initiation of legislation, reviews of the panel system and that the commencement date for the new arrangements should be made immediately after the Seanad election. I am happy to sign up to this. If we can have agreement among the parties here, we should set up an implementation group comprising Members of the Dáil and Seanad, together with whatever other expertise will be needed, and move the process on. I am prepared to sign up to that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	170	I welcome that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	171	Over the past 18 months, there have been horrific terrorist attacks both within and outside the European Union. Even this week we have witnessed the tragic events in Orlando and the murder of a French policeman and his partner. Tackling such terrorism, and the radicalisation which fuels it, is a challenge to which the EU attaches the very highest priority. Ireland has consistently called for a comprehensive and co-ordinated international response which addresses both the immediate effects of terrorism and its root causes. The commitment in the programme for Government to supporting the EU and UN efforts, and to working with third countries to stop the advance of brutal terrorists, comes in this context. Decisions at the European Council in February of last year, after the January Paris killings, focused on three separate but overlapping areas of activity, namely, steps to ensure the security of citizens, including better information sharing between member states; measures to prevent radicalisation and safeguard European values, with a focus on Internet-based activity; and deepening co-operation with international partners, especially in the southern neighbourhood. This is the broad agenda on which all the EU institutions continue to work. Following the attacks in Paris last November, the European Council reaffirmed the need to implement measures across all three strands. Developments since then include agreement on the passenger name record directive, substantial progress on Commission proposals on new directives for combating terrorism and the illegal firearms trade and agreement on an action plan against the financing of terrorism. It is all too clear however that work on all relevant issues needs to be intensified. With regard to radicalisation and terrorism outside the EU's borders, engagement has been stepped up with partners in North Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and beyond. The High Representative of the Union, Federica Mogherini, has confirmed that a comprehensive package of assistance provided to the Tunisian Government in 2015 to help tackle terrorism will be replicated in other countries this year. Meanwhile, EU counter-terrorism experts have been posted to Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia while a comprehensive counter-terrorism plan has been developed with Turkey under the European Neighbourhood Instrument programme. Of course, much current terrorist activity has to be seen within the context of the tragic and hugely destabilising Syrian crisis. We support all diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Syria and to counter the barbaric ideology and actions of ISIS. The EU's efforts in the areas of counter-radicalisation and counter-terrorism are underpinned by the UN Security Council resolutions, which themselves make clear that any long-term solution to the challenge that terrorism poses must address its underlying causes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	172	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. It is fair to say there is no doubt we are in middle of an age where severe threats are posed by extreme ideologies to all. The greatest victims of these ideologies are the people who belong to and live in the communities for whom groups like ISIS claim to speak. The people of Syria and Iraq are bearing the brunt of ISIS's barbarism. That is the bottom line. That is very evident from the migration patterns. With respect to the mass shooting in Orlando, President Obama's recent speech is one that should be read by many in this country and further afield and particularly by young people. He has spoken in very measured and reasonable terms and put fundamental values at the core of his message. There is no basis for using the actions of one person to stereotype and victimise others and, equally, we should not fall for the propaganda of groups trying to pretend to have larger networks than they actually do. Visitors to our country, no matter how senior they are, should be reminded that it is against Irish law to promote fear and hatred of a group based on religion or race and that message should go to the presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Promoting fear and hatred is not something that is in accordance with Irish law, particularly when it is targeted at groups based on their religion or their race. Does the Taoiseach agree we should reject the idea that terrorism is caused by adverse conditions? To do otherwise would be to belittle the struggles of the countless millions in poverty who do not turn to extremism and it misses the reality that throughout history other dark and generally populist forces are more closely linked to the growth of extremism and terrorism. Undoubtedly, we have to do more to support moderate forces which want to build strong civil society and oppose fundamentalism. One of the reasons I put the question in terms of the European Council and that side of the equation is that there is a lack of more fundamental thought being put into the whole idea of the roots and origins of this form of radicalism, if it could be called that, and terrorism and they need deeper exploration. I was hoping that the European Council, along with all of the immediate measures that are required to deal with the impact of terrorism and so on, would look fundamentally at the neighbourhood countries and the Middle East itself and develop a deeper understanding of the forces at work here to inform future strategy and geopolitical strategy across the globe in terms of what has happened and what is happening. In many respects, the migration from Syria is because of the conflict there, the appalling war and the appalling approach of Assad to his own people. There is no doubt that if the conflict could be resolved or if a proper framework, in terms of a peace process, could be put in place, it would have a huge impact on that migration story. There have been some horrendous stories emanating from Syria and Iraq of decent ordinary people who have had to flee their land and some of those people have arrived in Ireland by themselves. In one case, a young teenager, who had relatives here, made the long trek here. On the last occasion I spoke on this, I instanced a brilliant article by a Norwegian journalist, entitled The Wetsuitman. For anybody who wants to get a proper understanding of what migration is all about, it is not what Trump, or the scaremongerers, would have us believe. This was the harrowing story of two young people from aspiring families in Syria who wanted to pursue third level education and ended up falsely believing they could swim the English Channel. They purchased swim suits to do that and one ended up off the Norwegian coast and the other one ended up off the Dutch coast. That is the reality of migration and we should take away the ideology and the politics from this. That is what is actually happening and that is what demands a humanitarian response from Europe and societies like our own. We need to start fighting back against some of rhetoric that has been going on, which is only fanning the flames of racism and scaring people unnecessarily. Europe has to stand up for its values. President Obama did the international global community some good by his measured speech yesterday in response to what has been going on.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	173	In the first instance, I agree with the Taoiseach that the crisis in Syria and other parts of the region, including Iraq, Libya and the Middle East itself, has seen fundamentalist groups thrive in a dreadful humanitarian situation. We have seen recently, as the Taoiseach and the Leader of Fianna Fáil noted, ISIS attacks in France and Belgium. In recent days, we have had further attacks in France and then Orlando where the worst mass shooting in US history took place. That is where it is playing out. However, the UN revealed this week that more than 10,000 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean since 2014. It is a huge number of people. Tens of thousands are, even as we speak here, trying to make their way across in what are essentially coffin ships. Since the start of the year, 206,000 refugees have arrived in Europe. These are all linked. The people in Orlando, France and Belgium are all entirely ordinary, innocent civilians. As such, we must assert that religion, gender, colour and nationality are no excuse and that racism, injustice and sectarianism must be challenged. However, we must also apply ourselves to the treatment of the Palestinian people, which must be confronted. That is at the core of a lot of this instability. I put it to the Taoiseach that the recognition by this State of a Palestinian state would make an invaluable contribution. Sinn Féin is totally opposed to the EU approach of deporting vulnerable people back to Turkey where there is not only a risk but a probability that their human rights will be violated once again. Last year, the Government announced we would take in 4,000 refugees. Can the Taoiseach confirm how many of these refugees have actually arrived?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	174	I agree with Deputy Martin's comments on the speech by President Obama. I listened to the speech, which was clear, well measured and has been a stabilising influence. People should read it. I also agree with Deputy Martin in respect of comments which have been made in America that engender fear and hatred in people. This is contrary to Irish law and not acceptable. The Deputy made a very valid point about radicalisation and the threat for so many people arising from this. I understand that the way that this operates now, it can happen online and that those who may be radicalised or driven to murderous activities may never have to visit the country from where that comes in the first instance. I agree and have said at the European Council on many occasions that all of the problems which have afflicted many European countries are a result of the root cause of the Syrian conflict and the external issues to Syria in Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Kurdish areas in five nations and that these are issues which are often not explored in the depth one might like at the European Council due to time constraints. One relies on reports from the High Representative and different countries. We can all understand the implications of the entire populations of Munster and Connaught dropping everything in the course of any one week and walking to Derry or Belfast to get a boat to England, Scotland or wherever. The arrival of so many people who conducted ordinary lives before that brings to light the point the Deputy makes about what forced emigration really means. We have tried to play our part in that while we are not a member of that formal protocol. Deputy Adams mentioned the relocation and resettlement programme. We had a number of statements in the House about that previously. We have called consistently for an approach which addresses the root cause of this. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will deal with it in some further detail. Under Protocol 21, Ireland can choose to participate in any justice and home affairs measure under Title 5 of the relevant treaty. We chose to put a figure of 4,000 in terms of people in need of international protection. It should be noted that the programme was due to run until the end of 2017, but it will be extended because of delays in the arrival of people. Our immediate priority is to implement the measures in regard to relocation, which relates to people who are currently within the European Union, in particular Italy and Greece, and resettlement, which refers to refugees or asylum seekers who are currently outside the European Union. As such, one has relocation and resettlement. Progress on resettlement has been reasonable. We have already taken in more than half, or 273, of what we pledged under this and are on course to reach our target of 520 refugees by the end of the year. On relocation, progress has been very slow, as it has been for all other partners, for reasons outside our control, including operational and administrative difficulties.

We have already received the first family of ten and a further 31 Syrians have been security cleared whose arrival in Ireland from Greece is imminent. An additional pledge of 40 people was made to Greece on 22 April and these persons are expected to arrive in Ireland towards the end of July. After that, regular intakes of 40 persons every eight weeks are planned. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will be dealing with that in some further detail. I will send Deputy Adams a note in respect of Palestine. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is out there this week.

Like public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official or public events. Given the 1916 commemorations, I have attended many events this year in particular which have also been attended by representatives from various religious groups. As Taoiseach in the previous Government, I met with representatives from the Catholic Church, Church of Ireland, the Jewish community, the Islamic community, Atheist Ireland and the Humanist Association of Ireland as part of the structured dialogue process. However, I have not held any meetings under the structured dialogue process since the general election, but hope to do so in due course.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	178	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. However, one of the hallmarks of recent years was that there was no serious dialogue with faith leaders because Ministers insisted on talking through the media rather than face to face. There has been a great deal of talk about the issue of schools, which is important. Hopefully, we can see some real progress on both enhancing and protecting choice. It should not be a question of trying to get anybody, but should be about facilitating choice for parents and pupils. I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a much wider issue at hand and it probably relates somewhat to the previous question. We are in a period where, internationally, religious intolerance and fundamentalism are growing rapidly. In parts of Europe once defined by religious tolerance, the promotion of intolerance is reaching extreme proportions. In certain countries, anti-semitism is widely found while in others Islamophobia is increasing dramatically. We must be very clear that Ireland rejects this growing intolerance. The effective means to do so is to redouble efforts to support permanent inter-faith dialogue. That may involve reflecting on the existing structured dialogue to see if it can be enhanced.Can there be more regular ways of meeting, not just to engage in a formulaic manner but to examine everything that we do in the country in order to determine whether it is advancing religious tolerance and undermining any drift towards fundamentalism? Will the Taoiseach agree to convene discussions on how we might move forward and ensure we increase the understanding of other faiths among young people, in particular? Schools teach religion and, in some respects, young people today are more knowledgeable about other religions than we were when we were growing up and attending school, but there may be a need for further programmes to take that teaching out of the classroom to a certain extent, to use the good work that has been done in the classroom - some very good work has been done, as a result of which young people have a better understanding in some respects of the origins of various religions - and to bring greater momentum and encouragement to the idea of tolerating other faiths. Perhaps the convening of discussions might be a useful way to start.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	179	I do not disagree with what the Deputy said. A structured dialogue was initiated by my predecessors and I think it worked reasonably well in that it did allow for formal engagement between the Government of the day and individual faith leaders. As I said, we had face to face discussions with the groups I mentioned. It might be more appropriate if there were more regular meetings on the issues common to everybody. I agree with the Deputy's comments on anti-Semitism and xenophobia and the need for understanding and tolerance in this country. We still have an opportunity to deal with that issue in a much better way than many other countries that have or have not been able to deal with it. In the period ahead, as things settle down, I expect to meet the faith leaders again to discuss these matters. In fact, if it would be of added value, I would not mind having a discussion with the Deputies as leaders on the issues that might be raised or having the opportunity to have a collective discussion with them on their views on different issues. It is not for me alone, either as a person or because of the job I hold, to say I have all the answers in the meeting the faith leaders and the leaders of the different churches. Perhaps taking the opportunity at some stage to bring everybody together for a general discussion might be well worthwhile.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	182	That would be a welcome development. I understand the structured dialogue process did not happen because of other developments since the election. We need tolerance and a pluralist society. Increasingly, I am of the view that we need a secular society. We need to tackle the issue of sectarianism on this island, particularly but not exclusively in the North. Still a deep-rooted difficulty, the "isms" of racism and sectarianism are used to create artificial divisions between people. Across the island people want a different set of values, one that allows people with religious beliefs to practise them. It is a matter of personal faith or beliefs. Major issues need to be tackled specifically, for example, the Government's commitment to divesting the Catholic Church of its schools estate. I listened to Archbishop Martin's views on same and he was progressive. Five years ago the then Government announced that the patronage of 50% of schools would change by 2012. That has not happened. I understand only eight schools have been divested by the Catholic Church. As opposed to a philosophical discussion, we could have a discussion on a real issue. Last week the Minister for Education and Skills stated he intended to establish a working group to discuss with Catholic patrons how the transfer of patronage could be accelerated. It would be useful if the Taoiseach were to clarify when the working group would be established and when we could expect to see a report. As the structured dialogue has not begun, I take it that the Government has not held a formal discussion on the issue of admission to schools where baptism is used to discriminate against children and to prevent parents from enrolling their children in local schools. There are major issues that affect humanity in a global sense, whereas these specific issues affect children and the type of society we want. Clearly, parental choice is a factor in many cases, but we must ensure education is available to all and should not be conditional on whether a child has been baptised. When does the Taoiseach expect the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to be reinstated and has the Government considered amending the Equal Status Act to ensure local schools will be required to give priority to local children, irrespective of their religion or lack thereof?
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	183	On the question of meeting religious leaders, two issues arise: education and the eighth amendment. It seems clear that there has been a change in the Government's position. Under the previous Government which involved the Labour Party, many people were of the impression that there were going to be reforms under which an increasing number of schools would not be faith based but open to all children. In the light of the model envisaged by the Government, that position has changed and a so-called community national school initiative is being proposed. Approximately 400 out of 3,000 schools would be part of that model in five or 15 years time. How is this a choice? The new Minister for Education and Skills has stated he would like to see this model introduced, with pupils of different religions effectively being separated from their friends for religious instruction. That is segregation which, as has been proved, can carry into the school yard and playground. I represent an area that is probably the most culturally diverse in the country. One in four of the people living in Dublin West was born outside Ireland. Some are citizens, some are not. In the school my daughter attends there are approximately pupils of 110 nationalities, all of whom get on swimmingly. I am genuine on this issue. A Catholic secondary school was assigned to the area a number of years ago. In a year and a half when my daughter will attend secondary school, all of her friends will be split up across the four corners of the country because the school will only cater for a minority of those living in the area. This was not the Government's decision, but should we not just end the question of religion in schools being such a dominant issue? Why can kids not just go to school, learn what we all expect them to learn and play together instead of having this question being such a dominant issue in a society that is much more diverse?Does the Taoiseach believe it is right that a child's access to a school is determined by its parents' religion? That is what is happening in many areas. When this was last discussed in the Dáil, at which time Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin was the responsible Minister of State, we received representations from people whose children had been refused by eight or nine schools because all of them are Catholic. I am hearing – I heard this from Deputy Micheál Martin also - that parental choice is being used as a way of justifying discrimination.

Why can we not have circumstances in which schools are not faith based? I fully defend everybody’s right to practice a religion. I represent Hindus and Muslims who are trying to find places of worship in their area. I have no problem with that. At the end of the school day, those parents who want to use a school building to propagate their faith among their children should be allowed to do so, but all the children should be kept together for the school day. I do not see anything wrong with that model. I ask the Taoiseach not to go down the proposed road. It seems that the Catholic Church has contacted the Government and has asked for something it can accept and still remain in control of all the schools.

The Minister of State will appreciate that it is now 15 June and that the company closed three days ago last year. We have just passed the first anniversary. Clerys was iconic and was trading on O’Connell Street in Dublin for 162 years. It had 134 direct employees and in excess of 300 employed by concessionaires within the store. The news was very disturbing across so many levels. The closure was even discussed during a recent Private Members’ debate. So many issues arise in regard to employment law.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	209	I thank Deputy Niall Collins for raising this issue. The closure of Clerys department store and the manner in which its workers lost their jobs was totally unacceptable and should not happen again. A number of actions were initiated as part of the Government’s response to the closure of Clerys. They included the Duffy-Cahill expert examination of legal protections for workers. The Duffy-Cahill report was published on 26 April last, as the Deputy knows. It makes a number of proposals for reform of the law. My priority now is to complete the public consultation to allow for a response to be brought forward for consideration by the Government. I remind the Deputy that the consultation is to finish this Friday. The Company Law Review Group was asked to review company law. This was with a view to recommending ways company law could be amended to ensure better safeguards for employees and unsecured creditors. The work of the Company Law Review Group is progressing in this regard. Separately, authorised officers have sought information from a number of parties regarding the collective redundancies that took place in OCS Operations Limited on 12 June 2015. This work is ongoing. However, one of the parties from whom the authorised officers sought information initiated proceedings in the High Court challenging the powers of the authorised officers. As the matter is before the court, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further. With regard to compliance with company law, this is ultimately a matter for the court to decide in any particular case before it.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	210	I want to focus on a couple of areas. We all agree it is imperative that the legal framework that we put in place be fit for purpose in dealing with any future case similar to that of Clerys. I also want to focus on the Protection of Employment Act 1977, which provides that where an employer is considering collective redundancies, there is an obligation to consult employees and provide certain information to employees for the purpose of the consultations. This was obviously lacking in the example of Clerys. Flowing from that, workers’ representatives have campaigned. The Duffy report recommended the removal of the insolvency exemption from the prohibition on implementing collective redundancies during the consultation period. Section 14 of the Protection of Employment Act provides for the exemption from the prohibition against giving effect to collective redundancies until the expiry of 30 days after the notification to the Minister in circumstances of insolvency. Does the Minister of State support the 30-day notice requirement under the Protection of Employees Act 1977 in so far as it would apply to all collective redundancies, including in the case of Clerys? I wish to focus on section 224 of the Companies Act 2014. It states directors shall have regard to the interests of employees. It provides that "The matters to which the directors of a company are to have regard in the performance of their functions shall include the interests of the company's employees in general, as well as the interests of its members." The directors obviously have an obligation to themselves, their shareholders and the company but, equally, they have an obligation to the employees. Is the Minister of State happy that section 224 of the Companies Act 2014 was complied with in the case of Clerys? Can he comment on that? My other question was on the 30-day notice requirement under the Protection of Employment Act.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	211	I thank Ms Nessa Cahill, a company law specialist, and Mr. Kevin Duffy, the chairman of the Labour Court, for the work they have done. They are very distinguished, professional people. As the Deputy knows, the idea behind the report was to focus on limited liability in corporate restructuring and the view that it would not be used by a company to avoid meeting its obligations towards employees. The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are contemplating collective redundancies, including the obligations to consult employees and to provide certain information to employees for the purpose of the consultation. As I said, authorised officers sought information from a number of parties, but since the matter is sub judice, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on it. With regard to the company law aspect, about which the Deputy spoke, the report does not propose that any amendments be made to the existing provisions of the Companies Act 2014. However, it does state in clear terms that the existing company law provisions provide substantial weaponry that could be used against directors and related companies to redress the effects of and deter harmful transactions.These provisions are only of weight if the persons are employed and seen to be employed. The report makes proposals designed to facilitate and support the use of these proposals in future cases.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	212	While we all appreciate that much of this discussion is technical and observers could reasonably ask what it is about, we must also bear in mind those whose lives and jobs have been seriously affected by this case. We must also have regard to the fact that the Oireachtas cannot dictate to the courts how quickly they should act or what decisions they should make. Notwithstanding this, a degree of urgency is required. Section 599 of the Companies Act deals with the relationship between companies and, more generally, provides mechanisms whereby one company can be required to contribute to the indebtedness of the other. As the Minister of State is aware, the Clerys case involved a multi-company structure. The Duffy-Cahill report states: It therefore seems that section 599 is a potentially useful provision to address the concerns outlined in the Terms of Reference. It is only when this provision has been tested by the courts that any necessary amendments may become apparent. In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Social Protection indicated he was considering how the provisions of the Companies Act 2014, including section 599, might be used to recover moneys expended from the Social Insurance Fund. Is the Minister of State in a position to update the House on that issue and, if not, will he furnish such an update afterwards?

The Duffy-Cahill report is a comprehensive document which makes a number of proposals that need to be considered together as no single proposal will provide a solution. My priority is to ensure that these events are not repeated in the case of any other company. My second priority is to complete the public consultation and that will be done on Friday next. The stakeholders, including the business employers, trade unions and others, have been consulted. The Company Law Review Group has also made recommendations in respect of company law. The role of the Department is to formulate detailed proposals as quickly as possible to ensure this case is not repeated.

The sector is experiencing a period of growth and employs more than 137,000 people. More than 23,000 jobs have been created in hospitality since 2011, largely supported by lower VAT rates. According to the Irish Hotels Federation, the national hotel occupancy rate is at a ten-year high and 82% of hoteliers across the State have benefited from this. However, while business is booming, which is welcome, the 9% VAT costs the State an estimated €350 million per annum.

The setting of VAT rates is a matter for the Minister for Finance. In July 2011, the VAT rate for tourism-related goods and services was reduced from 13.5% to 9% by the Government as part of a measure to promote job creation. This incentive for job creation was due to expire at the end of 2013 but the measure was retained in budgets 2014 and 2015 owing to its positive impact on the sector. Between the second quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2016, direct employment in the accommodation and food services sector increased by 28,000, from 114,400 to 142,400. While it cannot be claimed that the reduction in the VAT rate has been the only factor driving employment in the sector, it has made a significant contribution and has had a very positive impact on the competitiveness of the tourism product. Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation to protect all workers, including minimum wage legislation. These rights apply across all sectors. Other wage setting frameworks include joint labour committees, registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders which are underpinned by recent legislation. Engagement in these frameworks is voluntary on the part of the stakeholders concerned. 
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	217	The reality for workers in the hospitality sector is that more than 50% of the 130,000 people working in accommodation and food services earn less than €400 per week. In addition, 17% of all other employees in the sector earn only the national minimum hourly wage and 41% of employees in the sector work part-time. While the average wage is €697.52, in the hospitality sector it is €324.86. Recent research by TASC, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, describes the sector as characterised by what are effectively zero-hour contracts. The Mandate and SIPTU trade unions, which represent workers in the hospitality sector, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have all condemned the outrageous campaign of misinformation waged by employer interest groups in the hotels, restaurants and service sectors against the decency threshold, namely, the joint labour committee system. The Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland have falsely portrayed workers in the sector as a privileged group receiving vast earnings which make businesses unsustainable and result in job losses.

As a Deputy from County Clare, I know how many people visit King John's Castle alone. The Deputy referred to the Irish Hotels Federation and the judicial review of May 2014 pertaining to the payment of workers outside Dublin and Cork. As I stated, the setting of VAT rates is a matter for the Minister for Finance. The purpose of the reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector was to support employment creation. As I indicated, the number of jobs created in tourism since the introduction of the lower VAT rate far exceeded expectations. The partnership for Government includes an ambitious project to create 200,000 jobs by 2020, including 135,000 jobs outside Dublin. With 50,000 jobs created this year, we are on track to achieve our target of reducing the unemployment rate to 6%.  While I understand the Deputy's position on this issue, a balance must be struck between work and decent pay for workers. The Low Pay Commission is addressing the issue of the minimum wage and will publish its report in the third week of July.

However, there is without doubt a concern among consumers and business that we are seeing the approach of a lack of competitiveness, tending towards a culture in which people are beginning to get ripped off again. I imagine the Minister is hearing this too. I tabled the question against that background.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	I am pleased Deputy Collins has raised this issue. Overall, the National Competitiveness Council has concluded that Ireland's cost base has improved over the past five years. We are now ranked seventh in the IMD World Competitiveness Centre report. However, we cannot be complacent. Ireland remains a relatively high-cost location for several key business inputs. Significant cost pressures remain for many Irish-based companies, especially property and business services. The Government is committed to the costs elements within our control. However, some significant cost pressures are outside our control, including oil prices, exchange rates and Brexit. Our focus must be on those costs over which we have some influence within Ireland. The Action Plan for Jobs has a number of actions across Government to support cost competitiveness. These include, for example, the cost of credit and insurance costs. The Government has also placed a priority on addressing property and housing costs. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with other Ministers on cost issues. I am keen to ensure the council's recommendations are considered by the relevant Cabinet committees. My objective is to foster a competitive business environment for all businesses. Deputy Collins referred to the rip-off culture. As Minister, I do not want to see that re-surface in Ireland. I will be keeping a close eye on this, as will my Department and the Cabinet committees investigating and dealing with this matter.

Equally, however, I am keen to point out that Ireland has continued to plunge in the World Bank ratings. We have dropped four places to 17th out of 189 economies. We are dis-improving by that parameter. According to the National Competitiveness Council cost of doing business in Ireland 2016 report, new businesses in Ireland are paying 80% more in interest rates for loans than our European counterparts. Moreover, Irish consumer prices are 20% higher than the euro area average, SME prices have increased by over 20% and, despite the legislation passed during the last Dáil, legal services have increased by approximately 6% since 2010. We debated the cost of insurance last week in the Oireachtas but insurance costs have increased by 60% in two years - almost 30% per year. Let us put this into context. The ESRI has stated that industrial output would increase by 2% for every 1% improvement in our competitiveness. In other words, it would represent a 2:1 gain if we could tackle our competitiveness. What plans does the Minister have to create a regulatory environment that would improve our competitiveness and lower the cost of doing business and attract new business into the country?

We have the Action Plan for Jobs and the regional action plans to ensure that jobs come into the country. Competitiveness is on the top of our agenda as well as bringing in jobs. We are looking at wages. Wages are mainly set in the private sector. I am mindful of the issues Deputy Collins has raised, including the cost of borrowing and insurance and so on. As I said, I will ensure there is a focus on these matters throughout the Departments. We must continue to use our taxation policies to promote a business-friendly environment. That is what we are about in the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I will ensure these issues are raised for business with the Minister for Finance.

There are many examples throughout this city and the rest of the country, including my region. These include the Limerick to Cork motorway and the Limerick to Waterford motorway. The road from Gort to Galway has to be finished. There are many parts to it. Broadband is chaotic throughout the country and this is inhibiting business and the consumers who want to transact with business over the Internet on a real-time basis. It is seriously problematic, as the Minister is aware. What are we going to do about it? Has the Minister given any consideration to the establishment of a national infrastructure commission to plan for the horizon of 20, 25 or 30 years and properly address our infrastructural deficit? The deficit is feeding in to our employment issues, imbalance in the regions and competitiveness.

I will be working with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, on this issue. I am aware of it. I am from County Galway and I know there is little broadband in Milltown, County Galway. This is on my priority list. Deputy Collins referred to road infrastructure. I was in Limerick promoting jobs and meeting various stakeholders there. This issue was brought up and the point was made strongly to me. Again, I am afraid neither I nor my Department can take responsibility for the roads but I will ensure the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport knows exactly how important this is. We know that we need proper infrastructure to bring in multinational firms and for our indigenous companies to work well.

Will she introduce legislation to outlaw this practice? Will the Minister make a statement on this matter?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	232	I thank Deputy Barry for raising this important issue. I am committed to considering an appropriate policy response to the report of the University of Limerick study of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts. As Deputies will be aware, the University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015 to study the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts and their impact on employees. The study, published in November 2015, found that zero-hour contracts, as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation, are not extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts. There are regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with if-and-when hours only or a hybrid of the two. Under if-and-when contracts, workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work. The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues. The UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and recommendations made are those of UL. Therefore, it is essential for the Government and my Department to seek the views of stakeholders. To this end, my Department has sought submissions from interested parties by way of a public consultation. A large number of submissions were received in response to the consultation.The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL. These responses require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department. The study and the responses to it will be considered by Government with a view to agreeing the actions that should be taken.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	The report may state zero-hour contracts are not extensive, but tens of thousands of people are affected by zero-hour contracts alone, apart altogether from the if-and-when contracts and the other low-hour contracts the Minister of State mentioned. These people have enormous difficulty organising child care, credit, bank loans and mortgages and accessing benefits, including FIS. In addition they have difficulty organising rent and paying for groceries or school uniforms when they do not know what their hours or salary will be the following year. UL reported back to the Department more than six months ago. Can the Minister of State give the House a more definitive timeframe as to when he will bring forward legislation or if he intends to introduce legislation at all?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	234	I thank Dr. Michelle O'Sullivan and her team at the Kemmy Business School for preparing the report. The report pointed out that zero-hour contracts are not exclusively used. There is, of course, evidence of if-and-when contracts. The Deputy is right in pointing to a lack of clarity regarding employment status. That is something that is also evident. I believe the Deputy is referring to if-and-when contracts more than to zero-hour contracts. People will argue about the unpredictable hours. The Deputy rightly pointed to the difficulties in managing family life, the unstable income and access to credit institutions. Often people with these contracts work more hours than they are contracted for. As I pointed out - I believe the Deputy agrees with me on this - we must give this report detailed and careful consideration. It is an independent report. Some 47 responses were given and the majority of those from trade unions and NGOs recommended implementation of the report and on the other hand employer and business groups opposed the implementation of the report. That is why we have to give this careful consideration and it takes time. We will do that and we will try to publish the report as quickly as possible after we give it that consideration.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	It does not surprise me that employer organisations have come out against a ban on zero-hour contracts. It would not take a commission or a rocket scientist to work that out. Is the Minister of State aware that the New Zealand Parliament voted unanimously to ban zero-hour contracts and that became effective on 1 April? In New Zealand employers now must guarantee a minimum number of hours per week and workers can refuse extra hours without repercussion. Is the Minister of State concerned that legislation here lags behind the example set by New Zealand? Is he aware the previous Administration, in the aftermath of the Dunnes Stores strike in April 2015, promised to take action on this matter? As it is now more than a year on, how long is the Minister of State prepared to wait on this? Can he give those workers who are in these extremely difficult circumstances any indication as to when he plans to bring forward legislation or does he plan to introduce legislation at all?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	236	This was a very serious report, but it is an independent report. As the Deputy rightly pointed out there will be different views on the matter. The trade unions and NGOs will support the recommendations and the employer and business groups will be against it. Those of us in government and the Department have to strike a balance regarding the employers and the workers. This will take time. We do not want to rush this. We want to ensure that careful consideration is given here. Some of the people who made submissions want to have meetings with departmental officials. We will consider all that in the context of the study itself. If legislation is necessary, obviously this is something we have to look at seriously. We will, after careful consideration, deal with this in the interests of workers and employees.

He told me at the time that the Department's key consideration when dealing with these applications is concern over the end user or the proposed end use and that it would not be for any illicit purposes. However, how can we be sure, particularly when we are talking about countries with an appalling record in transparency? Would an export ban not be a more appropriate way of dealing with it?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	238	My Department is responsible for licensing the export of dual-use items. All applications for the export of dual-use items are reviewed by my officials on a case-by-case basis. The licensing process centres on ensuring, as far as possible, that the item to be exported will be used by the stated end user for the stated end use and will not be used for illicit purposes. My officials seek observations from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the majority of export licence applications received. That Department provides feedback on any foreign policy concerns that may arise in respect of a proposed export. The small arms survey provides an overview of the international trade in small arms and light weapons. As the Deputy notes the latest bulletin highlighted transparency concerns around the arms trade in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. My officials have reviewed details of all licences issued for the export of military items and components to those countries from 2007 to date. I can confirm that my Department has not issued any licences for the export of small arms and light weapons to Saudi Arabia or to the United Arab Emirates during that period.  All export licence applications are considered having regard to EU sanctions. There are currently no sanctions in place for Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	239	I note the Minister's figures for this year. In 2014 there were 50 dual-use licences for exports to Saudi Arabia and in 2013 we issued nine military licences for export to the same place. If she is telling me there are no current ones, that is good. However, I would be very surprised to hear there are no current dual-use applications before the Department because in 2014 to the UAE there were 51 such applications. Dual-use items are not innocuous; they can have a military role. We are trying to get to the heart of the following question. What are the mechanisms to scrutinise this? The small arms survey was quite shocking in revealing a lack of transparency in these countries particularly. They are among the least transparent in terms of arms trading. The UAE came last. Saudi Arabia was below North Korea and Iran. Ammunition sold to Qatar, for example, has ended up in Libya. There is a European Parliament ban on military exports, but the Netherlands has gone further and banned dual use exports.

We do not feature in these reports as we do not have an arms industry and do not export small arms and light weapons. However, I take the Deputy's point that we manufacture components in the data industry that may be used. However, we are very careful and any application that comes to my Department undergoes strong and rigorous checks. The licence application is really scrutinised. We check with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we ensure we do not contravene it.I would also say that we are very careful. It is my intention to intensify the auditing process around export control and dual-use items. An additional staff member will be employed in the export licensing section.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	I am glad we have more resources. I would argue that we probably need even more again. The European Parliament voted on an arms embargo to Saudi Arabia because of the atrocities in Yemen. As I have said, the Netherlands went further by imposing a full embargo on dual-use items as well. That would be the most suitable approach in our case. Most of the dual-use items exported by Ireland to the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are category 5 items that are described as telecommunications and information security items. While that might sound innocuous, it can include telemetry, telecontrol and ground equipment that can be designed or modified for use with missiles, as well as radio jamming equipment, laser equipment and so on. It is quite wide-ranging. I remind the Minister that we exported straight-up military items worth €3.2 million to Saudi Arabia in 2013. We definitely need more checks. I do not think one additional person will be enough.

I remind her that the Department may refuse an export licence and has done so on many occasions. We denied four licences in 2011, one licence in 2012, four licences in 2013, eight licences in 2014, five licences in 2015 and one licence to date in 2016. We have very rigorous checks. I will make sure they are maintained. If non-compliance is proven, my Department has the power under legislation to take proceedings against exporters. Fines of up to €10 million, or terms of imprisonment of up to five years, can be imposed on exporters who are found guilty.

The quality of the recovery being experienced in Dublin and the greater Dublin area is not being mirrored in the rest of the country. Can the Minister comment on that and on the role being played by IDA Ireland in this regard?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	245	While I am satisfied that the position is improving, I want to see more being done. I expect IDA Ireland to promote every location actively. There is no doubt that site visits outside main population centres have increased. Since 2015, IDA Ireland has been working towards the targets set out in its strategy, Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019. Under this strategy, ambitious investment targets have been set on a regional basis for the first time. IDA Ireland aims to increase overall investment by 30% to 40% in each region. Statistics compiled by IDA Ireland already show a steady increase in the number of site visits outside Dublin. In 2015, some 57% of site visits were to locations outside Dublin, which represented an increase on the 2014 figure of 43%. Figures for the first quarter of 2016 show that this trend is continuing, with 58% of visits so far this year being outside Dublin. This renewed emphasis on regional development is achieving results already. A record 18,983 new jobs were created by IDA Ireland client companies in 2015. Of these, some 53% are based outside Dublin, compared to 49% in 2014.

Now that this problem has been acknowledged, we need to tackle it constructively. I will put a couple of facts on the record. In 2015, Dublin received 242 of the 565 IDA Ireland site visits, or 43% of the total. The Minister has quoted this statistic. However, this figure increased to over 50% when applied to the greater Dublin area, which comprises Dublin and the overspill of the city into surrounding counties of Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Louth. It was clear that this activity was still concentrated in the Dublin region in 2015. This pattern continued in the first quarter of 2016, when almost 40% of all site visits involved locations in our capital city. It is important to note that counties Carlow, Cavan, Laois, Monaghan and Roscommon received no site visits.

I assure him that I will take an interest in this matter. I can tell him that the eight regional development plans are on my desk. We are working our way through them. We will be meeting the implementation group soon. We will sit down to review the progress that has been made on the regional plans so far in 2016, with a view to developing the 2017 regional plans. I have a visited a number of counties since my appointment as Minister three or four weeks ago. I will continue to do so. I will make sure to meet the stakeholders in the regions who are driving this agenda and who will be driving the regional plans. It is absolutely on my radar. I will make sure this happens.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	250	I have three questions. First, I welcome the Minister's statement that 58% of all visits this year have been to locations outside Dublin, but I ask her to break it down for us. If she cannot break it down by county, perhaps she can do so by region. If she does not have that information to hand, she might forward it on to us as soon as possible. Second, I suggest that the manner in which we deal with this issue from a statistical perspective needs to be changed. We need to differentiate between Dublin and the greater Dublin area, as defined by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. In future, the figures for visits and jobs created should be broken down across three categories: Dublin, the greater Dublin area and the area outside of that. The conurbation around Dublin faces the same issues, such as housing but they just happen to be in Kildare, Meath or Louth, for example. Third, arising from the breakdown of site visits, is the Minister happy that sufficient property is available in the regions? I ask this in the context of the creation by the previous Government of a fund for advance factories and pieces of land. Is the Minister happy that the property portfolio is in place and is accessible?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	I am never happy and am always striving for more. I will make sure land is available for advance factories. We are building three such factories at the moment. There are plans for others. We want to make it easier to do business in Ireland. I will make sure advance factories are available. We are talking about IDA Ireland today, but I am also working with local people on the ground, with Enterprise Ireland and with the local enterprise offices to make sure there are jobs. I refer not only to multinational jobs, but also to foreign direct investment jobs. Deputy Kelly also asked me to give him a breakdown of the 58% figure. I have provided some figures in response to parliamentary questions. I will come back to him with a breakdown of all the figures.

A reply to a parliamentary question I submitted a month back illustrated that County Kildare had 13 site visits between 2011 and 2015, during the term of the previous Government. Seven of these arose in the final year of the then Government's term, 2015, which was essentially the general election year. In each of the four preceding years, there was a single visit. Visits spiked as the general election approached but were neglected for the four years prior to that. I hope we will not see a recurrence of this with IDA visits accumulating as we approach whenever the next election may be. Let us hope they are scattered across the term and we see more than one a year to County Kildare over the next several years.

On County Kildare specifically, the message from my office, loud and clear, to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland is to get out to the regions and rural Ireland. I probably am a good Minister in this regard because I am from rural Ireland and I want to see it develop. It should not be forgotten what happened between 2009 and 2011. The economy absolutely collapsed. To be fair to IDA Ireland, it put its shoulder to the wheel and brought jobs into Ireland. It is easier and more economic for the IDA to ensure the jobs come to Dublin. However, the message now is regional Ireland. Backing up that message are eight good regional plans.

What consideration, in terms of any of those arrangements, has been given to human rights violations, particularly over the past three years during the incarceration of an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa?

For example, various submissions have been made to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by different lawyers and non-governmental organisations. At all times, the key question guiding our approach is what stands the best chance of securing positive progress for Ibrahim Halawa at the earliest possible opportunity. The Government has been in contact with other states which have had citizens in similar situations. It is the Government's considered approach, supported by decades of diplomatic experience and extensive consultation with these states, that our diplomatic efforts still represent the best means of achieving the twin goals of protecting Ibrahim Halawa's welfare and securing his release at the earliest opportunity. His next hearing is scheduled for 29 June. Embassy officials will be in attendance, as they have been at every hearing of his trial, to monitor and to report on developments on the day. There has been frequent and ongoing communication with his family members through our embassy in Cairo and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade headquarters in Dublin.

The heart of this issue is that we have to use whatever economic clout we have to put manners on or to influence authorities in other regimes where there are human rights violations. Not to do so would place profit over people. The feeling was articulated clearly by the Australian captive who shared a cell with Ibrahim Halawa, Peter Greste, who said the Australian Government had lobbied forcibly for his release. The softly-softly approach of the Irish Government has not been sufficient. We should be pulling out the stops in terms of our agricultural dealings or whatever because it is not a different judicial process. It is a system of mass imprisonment, torture and appalling human rights violations in a completely undemocratic and unaccountable regime. We have to do more in this regard.

We want to provide every possible consular support for his welfare where he remains in detention. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has been in regular contact with his Egyptian ministerial counterpart, Sameh Shoukry, and the Taoiseach has twice met with the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, making clear the Irish Government's concerns and objectives in this case. Given that the trial is ongoing, the Government must remain measured and responsible in its public comments. This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases. While our objectives are clear, I too, along with Deputy Clare Daly and all decent Irish people, want to see Ibrahim Halawa released.

We have to look at the fact that Egyptian human rights organisations have documented at least 124 deaths in custody in the timeframe we are talking about through medical negligence, torture and ill-treatment. We know from his testimony smuggled out of prison that this young Irish man is in danger. In it, he spoke about waking up every morning to the screams of prisoners being tortured. He spoke about sleeping on the floor of his cell, witnessing people being punched, kicked, beaten and slapped, as well as the torture and crucifixion of others. This is a young man at the start of his life. The trauma this experience has already inflicted on him is, undoubtedly, going to last him a lifetime. There is an urgency about this matter. The fact the Australian Government was able to negotiate the release of one of its citizens should give us a signal as to what more we can do. Will the Minister contact the IFA and her ministerial colleague in agriculture to use their clout much more? Being nice and mindful has not delivered the results yet.

That is the best consular advice we have received. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has regular contact with his Egyptian counterparts while our Taoiseach has met with the Egyptian President on two occasions. We will continue to do our best to ensure the earliest possible release for Ibrahim Halawa.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	This question is about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations. The Minister’s predecessor was one of the hawks in Europe on it. Considering recent leaks about the TTIP negotiations and the public statements in the US that show Europe should beware that the US is trying to export its failed regulatory model, does the Minister consider the Government's approach should be reconsidered and that it should be opposing TTIP instead of egging it on?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	266	The 13th formal round of the EU-US free trade negotiations took place from 25 April to 29 April 2016 in New York. Progress was made on the two texts on regulatory co-operation and good regulatory practices. Substantial progress was achieved on the small and medium-sized enterprise chapter and on the provisions of customs and trade facilitation.This would simplify customs procedures and reduce fees and charges, to the benefit of Irish SMEs in particular. There was also progress in consolidating textual proposals on the sustainable development chapter, which includes labour and the environment, and on the investment chapter. Extensive discussions also took place on public procurement. Discussions covered mutual recognition agreements for professional services and significant progress was made on the consolidation of the text. Ireland’s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US, which will build on our already rewarding economic relationship and will also generate new opportunities to create employment and continue to grow our economy. Studies have shown that the benefits to Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. The 14th negotiating round is due to take place the week of 11-15 July 2016 in Brussels. The pivotal and overarching objective is to negotiate an ambitious, high-standard agreement that responds to both EU and US interests.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	267	Does the Minister consider the manner in which the negotiations are being carried out is at all problematic? In particular, there is the fact we need a leak from Greenpeace to see what is in the text and the fact Members of the European Parliament have to go into a closed room with no note-taking facilities in order to see the texts that have been negotiated. That should ring alarm bells for the Minister as it rings them for people all across Europe and in America. Is the Minister concerned that the leaked documents clearly disclose that the so-called precautionary principle which exists in Europe is in the firing line of the US position? Is the Minister at all concerned that it is precisely the notion of regulatory co-operation that will undermine our right, for example, not to have GM foods, not to have hormones in our beef, not to have pathogens in our pork and not to have chlorine-washed chicken? These are all things that currently exist in the US and which, if they cannot get them in the front door, they will get them in through the back door of regulatory co-operation.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	268	I thank the Deputy. I fully recognise that TTIP, and the process it involves, is full of many complex and difficult issues. Nobody wants a bad deal and along within every country, we in Ireland have our priorities. The Copenhagen economic study has shown that the right agreement could create anything up to 10,000 jobs here. Irish companies in the US employ approximately 80,000 people. Regulatory coherence between the US and the EU is a worthy goal and it should not and will not come at the cost of lowering operational practices for food safety, which the Deputy mentioned, employment protections or environmental health standards. Environmental, food safety and labour standards will continue to be at EU level and accountable to this House.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	269	I again ask whether the Minister is concerned that the precautionary principle is clearly under threat in negotiations and the European side does not seem to be defending it. I make the point that regulatory coherence is often presented as some very technical thing. Regulatory coherence is precisely about whether we have GM foods - they are regulations. When it comes to mutual recognition or coherence, is the direction going to be upwards in terms of protections or downwards? It is a negotiation that is driven on both sides by big business agendas, which precisely want a bad deal from the point of view of ordinary people and a good deal for them. Let us take the example of cosmetics. In the EU there are 1,328 prohibited substances in cosmetics; in the US there are 11. Mutual recognition of each other's regulations in regard to cosmetics will mean we can have all of those 1,300-plus substances that are deemed illegal entering into the market. The point about co-operation going forward is privileging the position of so-called experts who will be coming from big business in the writing of future regulations as opposed to it being the right of legislators to decide on regulations.

We will not change our rules on GMO and we will not accept hormone-treated beef, as the EU has made clear from the outset. The text of any deal will run to thousands of pages and it is still under negotiation. Nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed and I expect negotiations to continue for some time. Any final agreement is subject to agreement by all member states, including ourselves. It has to be approved by the democratically elected European Parliament and also by this House. The negotiating process is not complete at present. There is a reading room in my Department. I invite every Deputy to come over and see the two lever arch files of documentation that are in the Department. Deputies received a letter of invitation yesterday. I ask them to take it up and to visit the room.

Has the Minister examined empowering the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in regard to issuing civil fines for anti-competitive practices? To outline the definition of anti-competitive practices, as we would see them, there is what is called hard-core cartel activity, for example, price fixing, bid rigging or market sharing, and also what are called non-core infringements, which would be an abuse of dominant position within the marketplace.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	273	The current legal position is that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices. The Attorney General has previously advised my Department that providing for them would pose legal difficulties, having regard to Article 38.1 of the Constitution, even at the level of a class A fine. In that context, any legislation to introduce civil fines that would lower the burden of proof from "beyond reasonable doubt" to "the balance of probability" would pose constitutional difficulties, having regard to the protection afforded in Article 38.1. I am aware the Law Reform Commission published an issues paper, Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences, on 27 January 2016. The issues paper invites views on the supervisory and enforcement powers of the State’s main financial and economic regulators, including the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. The issue of administrative and civil fines has been raised. I look forward to the outcome of this consultation process. Any recommendations or proposals that may emanate from this exercise in due course will be carefully considered by my Department.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	274	Will the Minister outline, as far as she can, the Attorney General's legal advice? If I am quoting her correctly, she said the Attorney General has said there may be legal difficulties. Are there constitutional difficulties with the proposal? Like all of these proposals, the consumer and the public are being disadvantaged by some of these practices. Given the Competition Authority asked for these powers five years ago, and given we discussed in earlier questions the potential re-emergence of the rip-off culture in the Irish economy, does the Minister not think we should push a little harder and try to get clarity about this?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	275	The main argument is that the level of proof required to achieve a successful prosecution is too high for hard-core competition offences, for example, cartels and price-fixing, which are criminal in nature. In criminal cases, the level of proof is "beyond all reasonable doubt". By contrast, the level of proof in civil proceedings is on balance of probability grounds. Thus, proving a case in criminal cases is at a higher level.Very high penalties apply to criminal offences under the Competition Act. There is a fine of up to €5 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is the higher, for an undertaking, or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years for a person. That is the reason for having a high level of proof. The issues at stake are the constitutional implications of imposing large civil fines while having a lower level of proof. The imposition of large fines signifies the criminal nature of an offence.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	This question comes from the commitment in the programme for Government to create 135,000 jobs outside County Dublin by 2020. I will await the Minister's reply.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	277	A Programme for a Partnership Government sets a target of creating an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 jobs are to be created outside Dublin. I am convinced that we can achieve these targets. Since 2012, the unemployment rate reduced from 15.1% to 7.8% in May this year. We have 155,000 extra people at work since 2012 and employment is growing in every region. My focus is on ensuring we support new job creation in every region. The regional action plans for jobs are the mechanisms for delivery. Their objective is to increase employment by 10% to 15% in each region. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local enterprise offices are delivering on their elements of the action plans which are being driven by local implementation committees.  My Department is providing funding of up to €250 million to support the regional plans. A €150 million regional property programme is being delivered by IDA Ireland. On 1 June I announced an allocation of €5 million in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives through Enterprise Ireland. Further competitive funding calls will be launched shortly to ensure we achieve the jobs targets.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	278	Is it intended that they will be full-time jobs and what sectors will be targeted? I routinely come across people who tell me they are still having difficulties in accessing credit. They are trying to keep businesses going, but nothing much has changed for them, particularly for small indigenous businesses and start-ups. I have not read in full the ESRI's report which deals with the living wage. When pressed, an official of the ESRI made the point that poverty levels were directly impacted on by people being at work as opposed to being on welfare payments. We all want to see this happening. The ability to access credit is still a major issue and a real impediment.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	279	The Deputy asked about the types of job created. As a Minister and a mother, I want to ensure the jobs we deliver are sustainable. On all sides of the House there is an ambition to create more sustainable jobs outside the population centres. There is no single approach to this. It will require up to 40 or 50 separate actions involving IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices, local government services and third level institutions, as well as improved access to credit for SMEs. However, it needs much more than funding; it also needs a persistent drive across the public service and the business community. I ask every Deputy to come on board and help us to make it happen.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	280	We will all come on board in trying to assist, but when constituents come to us and state they are having trouble in maintaining people in employment because of the difficulty in accessing credit, it becomes an impediment. This is a particular aspect. We understand IDA Ireland has a particular role, while Enterprise Ireland has a different role. Obtaining seed capital for small new businesses can be a problem because there are rules. Does the Minister have a figure in mind as to what constitutes full employment? During the Celtic tiger years we were told a 3% or 4% unemployment rate meant full employment. Does the Minister count being in part-time work in the same way as being in full-time work? Very often being in part-time work is not sufficient to sustain a family.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	281	What I define as full employment is everyone who wants a sustainable job being able to find one. It is my job to ensure this will happen in the coming years. The Deputy asked about part-time workers. I understand many women are in part-time employment and would like to work more hours. There are people who choose to engage in part-time work and I understand this. We will try to ensure there is credit available. I am working to ensure money will be available through Microfinance Ireland and under the credit guarantee scheme. I wish to tell businesses that, through Microfinance Ireland, they can avail of loans ranging from €2,000 to €25,000. I strongly believe this information is not known and that SMEs do not know this. I ask Deputies to do something to help to ensure SMEs know that credit is available.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	282	The Minister has stated funding of up to €250 million is available. As I hate the phrase "up to", what is the figure? Is it €250 million? Will all of it be spent? I am sure the Minister will say, "Yes," but will she tell us how it will be spent? "Up to €250 million" could mean €5, €250 million or anywhere in between. A bugbear of mine, about which the Minister will hear repeatedly, concerns IDA Ireland and site visits. In a previous life I had personal experience of having to intervene to ensure Amneal located in Cashel because I was not satisfied with how the site issue was being dealt with. Why have only three advance sites been identified with regard to the €150 million to be used? How long will it take us to use the rest of the money? What are the timelines in which it will be used? Will the Minister break down for 2014, 2015 and the first six months of 2016 the number of approaches IDA Ireland has made throughout the country in the purchase of sites for companies that wish to locate in Ireland? Obviously, we do not want sensitive data on the locations.

I will ensure we spend €249 million or €249.99 million. I will certainly not send back any money. Anyone who knows me knows that I am able to live within budget, but I will ensure it is ringfenced to create jobs. The Deputy also asked about why there were not more IDA Ireland site visits. The money has come onstream and three advance facilities have been built. There are plans to build three more. I will try to ensure there are more and that we hurry up the entire process. Sometimes there are difficulties in planning, but we must ensure we drive through and get it done.

The funding generates new knowledge, leading-edge technologies and competitive enterprises in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. SFI provides funding across a range of "oriented basic research" through to "applied research". To answer the Deputy's question, SFI estimates that more than 80% of its portfolio of active research awards is for oriented basic research which takes place before the point of any type of commercialisation. This is the case even though SFI's remit was extended in 2013 to enable it also to fund applied research. SFI's research funding is allocated in accordance with Government policy whereby the majority of competitive funding of research is allocated to 14 priority areas and the platform science and technology that underpin these areas. However, it is important to make clear that research prioritisation has not impacted on funding of oriented basic research by Science Foundation Ireland or my Department.

The question remains unanswered, unless I misunderstood something in the answer. We are attempting to attract researchers and scientists and people of such professions into industry and into the country to begin their programmes. Without the specific funding targets and funding dates, these people cannot be brought in. The culture does not exist to attract them. This is an industry that by its very nature is very dependent on human capital, human resources, people and their families. They are highly mobile and we want them to relocate into this jurisdiction. In order to do that, we must tell them by what dates they must apply, when they will find out about their application, for how long they will be engaged, whether it is a multi-annual programme and where they stand. While I agree with the Minister of State's comments on the sector and how important it is - that is taken as a given - I have not yet heard a date or an implementation programme. When will the grants and the research be announced, by when must applicants apply and how does that happen? These are the real, hard figures and facts that we need for this to move forward.

To break this down, and to respond to the Deputy's question, based on information from higher education research and development, HERD, 50.9% of expenditure this year in the higher education system on research is on basic research and the rest is divided between applied research at 43.4% and experimental research at 5.7%. Innovation 2020 set a delivery date for 2017. If the Deputy is asking me the provisional deadline for applications in 2016, I do not have that deadline here but I most certainly will revert to the Deputy in that regard. What I can tell him is that there are 14 research priority areas, RPAs, which can be found on the website and which include networks and communications, data analytics, management, digital platforms, medical devices, diagnostics, food for health, therapeutics, marine renewable energy, smart grids and smart cities and so on. My plan is to meet with Science Foundation Ireland within the next few weeks, and the Deputy would be very welcome to come to that meeting with me.

I thank the Minister of State for that final clarification but we are approaching the end of the academic term and it is the summer months when people will be making decisions about where they position themselves into the new academic research year. It is therefore imperative that over the next three to four weeks we begin to make movement. If we can indicate to these people over the summer what is happening, then they can begin to make plans and we can attract the right people to the right research.

As I indicated earlier, I contacted Science Foundation Ireland and asked them to meet me within a few weeks so that we can discuss the priorities, the provisional deadline and so on. As I said, any Deputy in the House who is interested in the sciences, research and development and so on will be welcome to come to that meeting.

Deputy Coppinger has a similar question but she is not here. I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together in any event. I am committed to considering the appropriate policy response to the report of the University of Limerick of their study of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts. As Deputies will be aware, the University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015 to study the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts and their impact on employees. The study, published in November 2015, found that zero-hour contracts, as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation, are not exclusively or extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts. There are regular part-time contracts with fixed hours, contracts with if-and-when hours only and hybrids of the two. If-and-when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work. The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues. It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and that the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL. Therefore, it was essential to seek the views of stakeholders. To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of public consultation. A large number of submissions were received in response to the consultation. The responses contained a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL. These responses require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department. The study and the responses to it will be considered by Government with a view to agreeing the actions that should be taken.

Job insecurity and the casualisation of the workforce is something we see growing and that is why this matter has come to a head in the last few years. Bringing clarity to work hours is essential to creating decent jobs, in particular for those people who are in the most vulnerable sections of our society. Where I come from, in the south east, in Wexford in particular, a high proportion of people rely on these jobs. A recent report only last week highlighted the fact that Wexford and the south east in particular has 7,000 fewer third-level education positions and 6,000 fewer IDA jobs in proportion to its population when compared to the rest of the country. I ask the Ministers to bring in a task force or to do something urgent to address those issues.

We must examine the report, why it was commissioned and the recommendations in it. As the Deputy pointed out, while zero hours contracts are not often used in industry, the "if and when" approach is used, whereby people are not contracted to make themselves available. Outside of these, there is a lack of clarity regarding the employment status of many people who want to work, particularly in the hours the Deputy mentioned. As I previously said, we are concerned about the unpredictability of the hours and the difficulty of managing family life for people who have this type of uncertain employment, and the unstable income, which I mentioned earlier, which means people cannot get access to finance. A consultation process is in place. It finishes on Friday. We will take note of all the submissions, meet some of the interested parties, if necessary, and make our report.

There has been a focused, collaborative approach and a range of reforms have been delivered in the region over recent years. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 20.1% in 2012 to 12.5% in early 2016. Some 204,400 people are at work in the south east, an increase of 23,100 over the period. Over the past three years, employment growth in the region has increased at a faster pace than the national increase. While the current unemployment rate of 12.5% is still unacceptable and too high, the figures demonstrate that the overall trend is one of steady recovery. I am committed to working with the various agencies and stakeholders in the south east to ensure this trend continues and that sufficient sustainable jobs are ultimately created. The regional action plans for jobs initiative is a concrete example of the targeted approach undertaken to boost regional employment. The core objective of the south east regional action plan, which was launched in September 2015, is to realise the potential to have a further 25,000 at work in the region by 2020. We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within 1% of the State average.

There are 6,000 fewer IDA jobs and 7,000 fewer third level places in the south east than in the other regions. The district suffers from brain drain. The population aged under 25 and over 50 is at national norms, while the population between those ages is gone. People who get an education do not return, given that there are no jobs there. We need more than what is in place. We need a task force with specific goals for the south east to target the area and bring us up to the norm. We are 14 years behind the rest of the country and we need specific targets to be brought into place and action to happen to bring us up to the national average, at a minimum.

Tá áthas orm faoi sin mar tá mé cinnte go dtuigfidh sé bunús na ceiste. I have no major argument with JobPath in its own right, many people who will never get commercial employment are being enrolled in it. The Minister of State knows the type of people I am talking about and their profiles. He will be familiar with them from his clinics and from meeting them in other places, as I am. In some cases, JobPath requires people to travel 100 km to Galway once a week to fill in CVs for jobs they will never get. This is not the main issue I am raising today. Once a person enrols in JobPath, he or she is required to stay on the programme for one year. If JobPath was a voluntary scheme, it would be reasonable, however, it is as voluntary as the army volunteer who receives an order. Many of these people are coming to my constituency office and saying they have been offered a place in Tús but have been told they cannot leave JobPath before their year is finished in order to take the Tús place. As the Minister of State is aware, Tús places are highly prized. People want to take up Tús places given that they give them gainful occupation. We should fully recognise that people work on these schemes and that, at a premium of €20 per week, they are probably the cheapest employees in the country. Unfortunately, the Deputies here changed the means testing to make it even less attractive to enrol in these schemes. I am asking that people would be allowed to transfer mid-stream from JobPath to Tús. By the time they have finished JobPath, the Tús place will have been given to somebody else, and they will spend another year without something gainful to do. When I initially established the Tús scheme, it was not my intention that it would last as a one-year scheme. We know many people will never get commercial jobs, although the system does not want to admit it. The system never covered the commercial market and employed people, as I did. This does not mean they will not do good work, particularly given the very small top-up we pay them. Many of the football pitches, green areas, halls and community centres would not be maintained, open and in good condition were it not for these schemes.Where it is likely that a person will fail to get commercial employment through JobPath because the professional who is supervising him or her has figured out that his or her marketability on the open market is not great, he or she should be allowed to take places on the Tús scheme as they come up and should not be forced to pass them up and hope another opportunity will come up again once he or she completes the JobPath programme. The Minister of State knows many of the people to whom I refer because we share the same constituency and he knows that this dream of them all getting commercial employment is not based on the reality of the mixture of people in our constituency and in others.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	315	I thank the Deputy for tabling this Topical Issue to my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, who, unfortunately, has been called away at short notice. I am taking this on his behalf. JobPath is an employment activation service that supports people who are long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment. It is one of a range of activation supports, including schemes such as Tús and the community employment, CE, scheme, catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers. Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment and to assist them in finding full-time sustainable jobs. Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses the individual's skills, experience, challenges and work goals. The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job-focused targets. Jobseekers are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills. They spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed in a job, they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to 12 months while in employment. During their time on JobPath, they may also be referred for further education and training opportunities. Payments to JobPath providers are linked to, and dependent on, the success of the programme in placing clients into full-time sustained employment and on the quality of services provided. CE and Tús schemes provide long-term unemployed people with part-time experience as a stepping stone back to employment. However, they are not full sustainable jobs. To manage the allocation of activation support places effectively, the Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early to take up a place on another scheme. However, where a person is selected for JobPath and has a confirmed start date for another programme, including CE and Tús, then the person is allowed to start on the other programme if he or she so wishes. Participation in other schemes and programmes, including Tús and CE schemes, remains an option that will be assessed by the Department’s case officers once the jobseeker’s participation on JobPath is completed. The Deputy is correct that I have come across cases like those he mentioned in our constituency. I hope the same people are not approaching both of us.

I also recognise the importance of the great work that people do on CE and Tús schemes. The Deputy was involved in the establishment of those schemes when he was Minister. I will take this issue back to the Minister and ask him to re-examine it. The Deputy is correct that everyone is not suited to JobPath. I have met people who have fallen through the cracks and they are not capable for a variety of reasons of taking up such an option. There is validity in what the Deputy is asking for and I will bring the cases up with the Minister. He is new in the job but I will establish if he can re-examine the options the Deputy suggested.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	318	When I was asked would I accept that the Minister could not come to the House because he was otherwise engaged and I was told the Minister of State was coming in, I said that was acceptable because I know he faces the same realities with the same humanity that I face every day. When I set up Tús, it was initially intended to be similar to the rural social scheme whereby participants could make a career out of the scheme. It was intended for those who would never secure commercial employment. I recall when I worked in a co-operative that some staff worked in the commercial timber mill while others worked on a scheme. Some people were doing good work on the scheme but I would not have given them a job in the commercial part of the business for reasons that anybody who understands people knows. The Department sometimes reminds me of a cartoon published in Dublin Opinion many years ago of Cardinal Henry Newman reading a book he wrote on the university with a caption beneath it saying Cardinal Henry Newman did not understand students because the book was idealistic. There is an ideal in the Department of Social Protection that has been there for a long time that everybody in society is capable of securing a commercial job if he or she only put his or her mind to it. Let us face the reality that people vary in their many manifestations. They are not necessarily better or worse people but some people will never get a commercial job, anymore than someone will ever teach me to play music. I could be trained until the cows come home but I would not be able to play music. I wish I could; I would love to be able to but I cannot. I had all the music classes available as a child but it just did not work. I am delighted the Minister of State is present and all I can ask him to do is go back to the Minister and ask him to think about all those who visit his clinic and his colleagues' clinics, the reality experienced by the people we meet every day and recognise that a long-term as opposed to a one-year Tús scheme is needed, similar to the rural social scheme, which has done so much good work. Such a scheme would provide gainful occupation for people on a long-term basis. All they are asking for is a small top-up of their dole payment. They would then have the dignity of having somewhere to go and work to do. It is amazing, as I pointed out when I was in the Department, that we never seem to stop to ask ourselves what would happen to community services in most of Ireland if Tús, CE, RSS and other schemes were stopped. Most of the equivalent work done on these schemes is done by fully paid local authority staff in public parks and so on in Dublin. Will the Minister of State do his best on our behalf? His heart is in the right place.

JobPath will increase the capacity of the Department to provide services to jobseekers most in need of help and it has contracted two companies to deliver the programme's services. Both companies have considerable experience in successfully delivering employment services. There are two contract areas. The roll-out of JobPath is expected to be completed in early July and, at that stage, all departmental offices will refer jobseekers to JobPath. Some 37,000 clients have been referred to the programme on a pilot basis and the experience so far has been positive. For all the positive cases, there are people who fall through the cracks and who are in dire straits. These are the cases to which the Deputy refers. There are success stories and positives, as there are under every scheme, but we must address the people who fall through the cracks because of the terms and conditions of the scheme or because they are not suited to it. I will take that up with the Minister. Jobseekers retain their social welfare payment while on JobPath. Participation in the programme is mandatory and all decisions about client welfare entitlements are taken by departmental officials. JobPath contracts stipulate a significant number of requirements that both companies have to meet and the contracts have an inbuilt service guarantee, which means that each jobseeker will be guaranteed a baseline level of service, including frequent meetings with case officers and a transparent complaints process, etc. JobPath providers are bound under contract to achieve specified levels of employment, progression performance and customer service quality and failure to achieve these targets will affect their payments. Service quality will be reviewed by independent customer satisfaction research. This will be rolled out fully in July. There has been a pilot programme. I will take up the cases highlighted by the Deputy with the Minister to see what can be done to allow these individuals to opt for other schemes where possible.

I was first elected to Fingal County Council 12 years ago last Sunday. During that time, there have been major deficiencies in the wastewater infrastructure in the Fingal area. Both Deputy Burton and I represent constituencies in the Fingal County Council jurisdiction. Balbriggan, Rush, Skerries and, more often than not, Malahide and Portmarnock have been affected by serious difficulties with the infrastructure provided by the county council.There has been exponential growth in both constituencies and, in the case of coastal towns, somewhere in the region of 90,000 people live in the areas affected by no-swim notices in recent weeks. This unacceptable. In the town of Rush which has a population of approximately 11,000 - I am sure that figure will be borne out by the census results in the next few months - 75% of the waste generated is flushed out to sea untreated. When I was elected to Fingal County Council 12 years ago, there were contracts for the segregation of the wastewater and surface water in both Rush and Malahide. Both were put out to tender, but, unfortunately, both had to be withdrawn and a few years later the entire process collapsed following the downturn in the economy. The difficulty we have is that in Fingal which has a community of more than 250,000 which is growing enormously there is seriously substandard water infrastructure, particularly waste infrastructure. While I appreciate the work Irish Water is doing in Rush, in particular, it is simply unacceptable that when we had what could not be described as a deluge - I believe it lasted for about eight minutes in Portmarnock - the entire beach had to be shut down for a period of three days. At the northern end of the constituency it had to be closed for longer; admittedly there was heavier rainfall, but the major difficulty I have is that there does not seem to be an impetus to have the infrastructure upgraded. I will ask a question and then conclude.

Beaches that are well known and were named for their beauty such as Velvet Strand were closed because faecal waste, nappies and so on were floating in the water owing to heavy rain, as a result of which the pumping stations were overflowing. It seems extraordinary that nothing was said by the Minister responsible for the environment. His Department has not yet been renamed, but when it is, I understand he proposes to drop the word "environment" from the title. This would be an environmental disaster. I know that the Government is focused, in particular, on rural Ireland, but believe it or not there are people living in urban Ireland and the closure of all beaches in a heavily populated part of the country is an environmental disaster, about which concern has not been expressed and in respect of which no action has been initiated by the Minister for the environment who, unfortunately, is not able to be with us today. In both Rush and Loughshinny, where there have been problems for years, we are now at the point where if we have a fine summer in which there will be downpours every so often which seems to be the emerging pattern as the climate changes, we could face the closure of beaches for a prolonged period. I ask the Minister what, if anything, the Government intends to do to address this environmental disaster which, if it were to happen even on a single beach in a rural area, I have no doubt we would have six, seven or perhaps ten Ministers falling all over it and possibly running down to inspect the damage. I do not think we have received any ministerial visit.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	324	I thank both Deputies for raising this matter. I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, who cannot be here. I am aware of concerns about discharges in north county Dublin and the subsequent impact on beach water quality, including in Rush. However, it is important to state neither the Minister nor his Department has any direct role in monitoring or supervising the delivery of water services or any pollution incident arising therefrom. While it is unfortunate to have beach closures, particularly during the peak tourism season, it must be acknowledged that such closures take place primarily on a precautionary basis for the protection of public health. Where local authorities identify particular risk events such as intense localised rainfall or a discharge incident at an urban wastewater facility, a bathing prohibition will allow for the testing of waters while protecting public health. All such incidents are reported to the Environmental Protection Agency's wastewater enforcement system and publicised on the SPLASH website at splash.epa.ie., the national bathing water information website for identified bathing waters around Ireland. The 2015 bathing water report produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, identifies several bathing waters adjacent to urban areas, particularly those in and around Dublin Bay, as being prone to episodic pollution events and having less than good water quality status. In Fingal, Rush South Beach and Loughshinny fall into this category. Such episodic pollution events are generally associated with overflows from pumping stations or storm outfalls as a result of sewer network blockages or following heavy rainfall. The EPA's report highlights the remedial works planned by Irish Water in Loughshinny and Rush and significant infrastructural investment will be required to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of pollution events in these urban areas. The EPA is the environmental regulator responsible for the licensing, authorisation and enforcement of urban wastewater discharges consistent with the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive. The directive sets out requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban wastewater, with the objective of protecting the environment from the adverse effects of wastewater discharges. In its most recent annual report for 2014 on compliance with the directive, Urban Waste Water Treatment in 2014, the EPA has identified 42 urban locations in which untreated sewage is being discharged to waters. The report outlines why significant and sustained investment in the public water and wastewater systems is needed. Historical under-investment in water infrastructure in Ireland now means that Irish Water has major issues to address in the coming years and providing funding for that investment is a very significant challenge for the Government. Bringing Ireland into full compliance with the urban wastewater directive is a priority for the Government, but it will take a number of years of sustained investment to achieve this. Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level, including the management of urban wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, and is responsible for compliance with the requirements of authorisations issued by the EPA. Irish Water has put in place an investment plan setting out where it considers investment in infrastructure is necessary and in developing investment plans it is required to consult the EPA and the planning authorities, among others. The water services strategic plan, WSSP, published by Irish Water outlines the strategic direction for it in the short, medium and long-term timeframes up to 2040. It identifies and prioritises the key objectives required-----

I accept the point that the Minister has no direct responsibility for monitoring water quality, but he could pick up the telephone and talk to the head of Irish Water, highlight the press coverage of such instances that have occurred on a regular basis and ask the question I am asking today: why are we waiting so long for basic infrastructure to be put in place? As I mentioned, 75% of the waste flushed down toilets in Rush goes directly out to sea untreated. Rush is not a small town; it has a population of more than 10,000. In certain parts of the United State it would be considered to be a city. We have to invest money in infrastructural projects that would make a significant difference. I was elected to the local authority 12 years ago and for all of that period this has been an issue.No priority has been given to providing a basic element of societal infrastructure such as a reasonable waste water facility.

Developers did very well out of the people in the area. In the different towns like Lusk, Portrane and Loughshinny, people paid high prices for their homes and paid large development levies within that price. In fact, people living in the area have contributed a great deal to pay for this infrastructure. What is extraordinary is that the Government has also now quasi-suspended Irish Water from what we are led to believe in terms of the deal with Fianna Fáil. As such, it is almost back to the council days of old when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were in an unholy alliance to do the bidding of the developers. There is no response as yet to what is an environmental disaster.

As I said at the beginning of the reply, there is historical underinvestment in water infrastructure which is the reason we now have this major crisis. I will raise with the Minister the Deputy's concern around his lack of response to the crisis. Perhaps he might come back to the Deputy himself. While tackling the causes of beach pollution is a high priority for Government, it is important to note that the quality of Ireland's bathing water is generally very high with just over 93% of identified bathing water sites, or 128 of 137, meeting the minimum EU standards for sufficient water quality over the four year assessment period 2012 to 2015. Of those, 83%, or 114, were classified as either excellent or good water quality. I know we are not debating that but what the Minister is saying very clearly in his reply is that because of the historical underinvestment in water infrastructure, Irish Water has the major issue of playing catch up. I will raise the issues the Deputies raised with the Minister. I have taken notes and will ask the Minister to come back to them both on a one-to-one level.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	330	I wish the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, the very best in his new Department. I note that he has been to Ballymahon and Athlone in relation to this project and assessing the viability of the greenways. First, I will focus on the Westmeath section. The Government has commissioned a cycle route from Mullingar to Athlone at a cost of €7 million, which came from the economic stimulus fund. This has been a huge success for the area. When discussing these projects, it is important to use the word "greenways". What we mean by that is that they are suitable for cycling, walking, running and family events, which brings the whole community together. I note that activity has increased sharply along the Mullingar to Athlone greenway and the use has been significant over the last number of weeks. Car parks are being developed at key locations along the greenway to ensure maximum use. However, the Athlone section of the greenway needs an extension from Garrycastle, where the greenway currently ends, to White Gates in Athlone. This is a ready-made project and would have huge benefits in terms of providing access through to the regional sports centre and three schools. It would form part of the regeneration of the area. I urge the Minister, having been to Athlone and hearing first-hand from the officials, to progress this project and authorise funding from his Department. There could be huge community gains. I will focus now on County Longford. I acknowledge the huge work that Longford County Council is doing in relation to the greenway network. The local authority has a proposal to progress a section from Abbeyshrule to Ballymahon and Killashee. The Part 8 planning permission process has been completed for the section and, as such, I point out that this is a ready-to-go project. I urge the Minister to consider strongly approving funding within the Department for the project. He was also in Ballymahon where I attended a meeting at which he met the officials of Longford County Council. The previous Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was also in the area where he met the local authority and public representatives to discuss this worthwhile project. Longford County Council has invested a huge amount of funding in this, €50,000 on two occasions. I also understand that Longford Tourism invested €250,000. A lot of people in Longford are frustrated about the finishing off of the national spatial strategy which precluded the county from applying for a lot of different streams of funding. That was because of the gateway status heretofore. However, with the dawn of the Center Parcs project, the Government has a key chance to invest in County Longford to make it a hub for tourism. That can be developed now. Fáilte Ireland is aggressively promoting Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way and this is a key project it can get behind in terms of the whole gateway status in County Longford and County Westmeath. In turn, that would improve tourism in the county and have massive economic benefit. It also has great health benefits for the area. Families and communities can gain the rewards from this investment and enjoy the fruits of it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	331	I thank the Deputy for bringing this very important issue to my attention. Indeed, I have had more questions on this particular issue in the last two days than I have had on anything else. Greenways are all the rage. As the Deputy said, I was recently in County Westmeath and met him, my colleague, Deputy Kevin Moran, councillors and officials from Westmeath County Council. I was taken by their commitment to developing greenways in County Westmeath and was impressed by the significant work carried out to date on both the old rail trail from Mullingar to Athlone and the greenway from Mullingar to Abbeyshrule in County Longford. Both projects were funded by my Department as was the original section of this greenway from the Meath border to Mullingar alongside the Royal Canal. To date, I understand that Westmeath County Council has been provided with funding of €8.7 million for greenway development in the county. This shows the commitment of both Westmeath and my Department to the development of these wonderful amenities. Indeed, Westmeath is the centre of much of the greenway network that we have in this country. From the county border with County Meath to Abbeyshrule in Longford and Athlone, there is a grand total of just over 80 km of greenways in County Westmeath. With regard to County Longford, I understand that the county council has done some very good work to date with no funding from other sources to achieve planning permission for its own cycle network in the county. It also provided the entire funding to extend the greenway from the county border with Westmeath into the village of Abbeyshrule. This is an example to other local authorities of what can be achieved through a bottom-up approach to the development of greenway projects. With the prospect of the Center Parcs facility opening near Ballymahon in a few years, the future for tourism in County Longford is looking very positive. As part of my Department's plans for the Galway to Dublin greenway, we hope to continue the greenway from Garrycastle to the marina in Athlone and westwards across the Shannon to Galway. I understand that Westmeath County Council has planning in place for this section and is shortly to submit an application for planning for a new bridge across the Shannon from the marina. I understand that the proposed extension from Garrycastle to White Gates provides links to a number of schools and colleges in Athlone and would therefore provide the opportunity to assist in increasing the numbers cycling to school and college. This is a hugely important benefit to those living in Athlone and the surrounding area and would also be of benefit to the younger generation in educating them and encouraging them in the use of more sustainable forms of transport. The experience of the great western greenway in County Mayo has shown that there is a definite appetite for this type of route, which provides not only a different view of the country in terms of the tourism experience, but also a safe and secure route for cyclists of all levels of ability and confidence. The cross-cutting benefits of cycling are multifaceted and range from tourism and health, both physical and mental, to rural development and urban regeneration. Anyone who has seen the transformation of Newport on the great western greenway will have seen this first hand, not to mention the contribution to a reduction in carbon emissions and a decrease in congestion in our towns and cities. I was pleased to see that the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Dublin City Council's publication of the canal cordon count for 2015 showed another increase in the numbers cycling into Dublin city centre during rush hour. We need to continue increasing the numbers cycling, and greenways provide an easy introduction to cycling for some and a reintroduction for others who may have cycled when younger.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	332	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and will make a few points on foot of it. As he outlined, a number of projects will be considered for funding by his Department, but I assure him that the projects in counties Longford and Westmeath would have major benefits. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the fact that they are ready to go. Longford and Westmeath county councils have done great work to date and significant economic benefit could be reaped by going the extra mile. I will push this point strongly for County Longford, the people of which have endured a great deal in recent years. The dawn of the Center Parcs project is a ray of hope, but we need to get the facilities in place to meet that project. We must work hard so as to ensure that the cycle network is up and running and we can get maximum benefit from the project. We must market the greenway aggressively. Fáilte Ireland has a number of projects nationally, including Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way, but this one involves a number of local amenities and features that could bring significant economic benefit to the area, for example, old abandoned stations along the Mullingar-Athlone route that could be visited by tourists, provide a glimpse of our past and be a great asset to our community. I thank the Minister for his work and for visiting the constituency and meeting officials from the area. I urge him to put this project at the top of his Department's regional priorities.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	333	I thank the Deputy. I hate to say it to him, but I have been invited back to Athlone by Deputy Moran. Deputy Burke will be fed up seeing me, as I will revisit the area and see those parts of the greenway that I did not see last time. I am energised, as are my Department and my colleagues, by the idea of greenways, which was only recently introduced to me in a serious way. Deputy Burke will find that the Department and I are not lacking in our enthusiasm for the project that he described and I hope that we will be able to see progress on it shortly. Funding is an issue for cycling infrastructure in our towns and cities and for greenways development. I am considering which projects we will spend the remainder of our 2016 allocation on, focusing on those that can be delivered as soon as possible. The projects submitted by Westmeath and Longford will figure in those considerations, as will the sections of the Galway-Dublin greenway in counties Kildare and Meath that would provide a 100 km route from Maynooth to Athlone and see a significant increase in the already impressive numbers using the old rail trail. Only those greenway proposals that have planning permission in place, such as those that I have mentioned along with the Tullamore-Lough Boora greenway in Offaly, will be considered for this reallocation of funding. I hope to be in a position to make these decisions on funding shortly.

I am grateful for her attendance, as she has had a busy day at the children in 2016 event, which looked fantastic. I am asking my question because there is a concern in the sector and among facilities, be they privately run child care facilities or family resource centres, that there may be some difficulty in their capacity to operate at current levels of service provision when the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 enter into effect. I refer specifically to regulation No. 9(4), under which all employees must have at a minimum a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 award in early childhood care and education by December 2016. My understanding is that this applies specifically to staff counted for ratios. The only exceptions are where an employee has signed a declaration on or before 30 June to the effect that he or she will retire from employment before September 2021 or where the employee has received a letter from the Minister. This means that all staff within child care settings who are counted for ratios must have an early years QQI level 5 award, whereas until January 2017 only two staff need to have level 5 awards while any additional staff counted for ratios need no early years qualifications. These regulations were widely welcomed. Táimid báúil leis an iarracht anseo agus tá polasaithe Shinn Féin láidir ina leith seo. Is dócha go mbeadh an earnáil níos proifisiúnta. Sinn Féin supports the increased professionalisation of the sector, the regulations and their aspirations. We also support more affordable and better quality child care as an investment in the future. We support the aim of a 60% degree-led early childhood care and education, ECCE, workforce by 2025, as recommended by the EU. We believe that training must be given at the Government's expense and during paid time for workers. We seek the immediate roll-out of Síolta and Aistear through county child care committees. In order to support quality in the sector with an incremental move towards its becoming graduate degree led, the Government should expand the learner fund to levels 7 and 8 qualifications, which I understand would cost approximately €16 million. The regulations' objective is important and one that we support, but many facilities that, although they have high staff levels, do not have enough people at each level of qualification under the regulations, must hire additional qualified staff at substantial cost. They must weigh up whether to take on the additional staff or accept fewer children. The latter has a cost implication, although not as high as that of employing additional staff. Fewer early years places for children aged between one and three years is an outcome that none of us wants, as it would have a significant impact on children and families, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, and would exclude vulnerable children. The Government has acknowledged that this is an issue and facilities are applying for additional funding, but it is unclear as to whether they will receive anything. The Minister may claim that it comes down to budgets, but the timeframe is tight for the facilities. The regulations do not enter into force until January, but the school year starts in September, which means that many providers must make the decision now if they are to be prepared. We are not advocating that the regulations' implementation be delayed any further, but additional resources are required and it is essential that any decision on whatever Supplementary or Revised Estimates are needed be taken now.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	335	I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire for raising an important question, as it gives me an opportunity to put on the record some of the ways in which we have been preparing for the implementation of the new child care regulations. I assure the Deputy that, although I was at an extraordinary event where we launched a report, Children Seen and Heard: 1916 to 2016, at Áras an Uachtaráin, I would never be too busy to be present to respond to his important questions and concerns. I will offer a couple of reflections that go wider in terms of the regulations that are coming into place while addressing the specific question on qualifications, which is important in the context of the regulations' implementation.I will address the Deputy's question also.  As the Deputy knows, new child care regulations were published in May of this year and will come into effect on a phased basis from 30 June 2016. The 30 county and city child care committees around the country have been providing significant support to providers to deliver and develop their services and to ensure compliance with the regulations. In addition, the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has hosted multiple roadshows around the country to communicate with providers on how the new regulations will affect them. It is critical that Tusla is doing that. There has been a large attendance at the roadshows and feedback has been positive. The Child and Family Agency is working on the preparation of the quality and regulatory framework which will be used to inform early-years inspectors and providers on compliance with the regulations. As the Deputy indicated, we welcome the regulations. It is important that we have regulations to ensure quality for children. This is proactive work that is being done by Tusla to help the sector to be ready. A core part of the quality agenda pertains to increasing the qualification standards of those working in preschool child care. This is at the core of the Deputy’s concern. The new regulations require that all staff members working directly with children in preschool services must hold at least a major award in early childhood care and education at level 5 on the national qualifications framework, or a qualification deemed to be equivalent. This requirement will come into effect for newly registering services on 30 June 2016, and for existing services on 31 December 2016. I understand that an estimated 91% of child care workers already meet this requirement, and that the majority of the remainder are currently enrolled in courses that will provide appropriate qualifications. In order to support staff in meeting the new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund, which has already allocated €3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of upskilling. Funding of €1.5 million was allocated for Learner Fund 4 in budget 2016. This will be allocated to 1,000 early-years practitioners to undertake and complete the level 6 qualification. A large number of further and higher education institutions provide courses that are producing graduates at level 5 through to level 8 every year, and my Department is working with the Department of Education and Skills to monitor supply in the coming years. My expectation is that, in general, there will be sufficient capacity in the early-years education sector to cater for the September 2016 intake of children for the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, the expansion of which was announced in budget 2016. This expansion means that children will be eligible to start free preschool when they reach the age of three, and continue to avail of free preschool until they start primary school. As a result, the number of children benefitting from the ECCE programme will rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.

The figure of 91% is new to me. It certainly represents a substantial number. The Minister and I touched on the issue of additional funding provided by the Learner Fund. When people have additional qualifications, it has an implication for pay. We are very keen to emphasise that the increase in professionalisation in the sector, in light of our desire to ensure qualified professionals remain in the sector, will be reflected in pay. This probably should have been dealt with earlier. That is not the fault of the Minister but there is a need to deal with it now. There was an option to be proactive and it was not taken. There are facilities that are currently applying for additional funding, not only for training but also for the payment of staff. It is unclear to them whether they will receive it. They may but it is difficult to make a decision at this point. Is there any intention, through a revised Estimate or other means, to confirm for the facilities applying for additional funding that this funding will be forthcoming so they will be in a position to maintain their current level of service provision?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	337	I have a couple of points to make on the Deputy's additional question and one or two points on his original contribution. There are two aspects, the first of which concerns the support my Department provides to the practitioners and professionals in the early-years and child care setting, specifically in regard to the Learner Fund. As the Deputy is aware, Learner Fund 3 was to provide support and grants to individuals so they could bring their qualifications up to level 5. As I stated, 91% have achieved this. The fund will be open until July of this year. If there are any practitioners who need upskilling to level 5, the option is still available. The Learner Fund for level 6 is in train. That was part of the 2016 allocation. The Deputy indicated that 60% of the workforce should be degree-led by 2025. My ambition is higher than that. Perhaps I should say “60% sooner than 2025” but I am working with the officials in my Department to examine the feasibility of this. We must determine the kinds of resources we need to provide to practitioners to ensure we meet the target sooner than 2025. I have begun conversations on considering the Estimates for 2017. The second aspect of the Deputy’s question concerned the cost of preschool services and whether the funding is sufficient, especially as we extend the second year. The Department is commissioning an independent review of the cost of child care, which will begin, I hope, in early September. The information we will obtain will influence the additional resources that I am sure I need to seek to support the extraordinary people in the sector.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	338	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to introduce the Bill to the House. Members will be aware that parole has operated in the criminal justice system for many years. It applies to offenders convicted of serious offences on whom longer sentences, including life sentences, have been imposed. The system currently operates entirely at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and Equality. In making the decision to grant or refuse parole, the Minister receives advice from the Parole Board, which is a non-statutory body. The system of parole is very unsatisfactory because it is not based in statute and is ultimately controlled by a politician. In saying this, I mean no disrespect to politicians. However, it is inappropriate that a politician should have the ultimate say as to whether a prisoner should be granted parole. Prisoners who seek parole and citizens are entitled to know what is the basis on which parole is being granted to a prisoner. It is important to have in place an independent, transparent and statutory-based scheme that sets out how and when a person is granted parole, rather than leaving this decision to the discretion of a politician who may be swayed by factors outside of what is necessary for the good of society and the rehabilitation of the prisoner. The Bill has four objectives. I will outline briefly what these objectives are before discussing some of the provisions of the Bill. The first objective is to establish an independent parole board on a statutory basis. While many Governments have made commitments to establishing an independent and a statutory-based Parole Board, it has not yet been done. The second objective is to give this independent statutory board responsibility for the decision to grant parole, thereby removing this responsibility from the Minister for Justice and Equality. The third objective is to establish, on a statutory basis, clear criteria for the granting of parole in order that citizens, victims of crime and prisoners know the basis on which applications may be made for parole and the basis on which it can be granted. The fourth objective is to give victims of crime a say in the process whereby they can be heard in respect of an application for parole by the person responsible for committing a criminal act against him or her or a member of his or her family who died as a result of a criminal act. The statutory scheme I propose does not change in substance the current eligibility for parole. What I have sought to do is replicate the system that informally operates at present and place it on a formal, statutory basis. While I am aware that some people may be concerned that individuals may apply for parole after eight years, in most years, they will not be granted parole, particularly in cases involving life sentences. As the Minister will be aware, in most cases, there is a rule that parole is not granted in cases of life sentences until a term of 15 years has been served. However, the eligibility criteria simply replicate the current system in place and the way in which it is operated by the Parole Board. This issue can be discussed in greater detail in committee, at which point more specific requirements may be set down in respect of eligibility. The Bill does not propose to replace the current temporary release provisions but places the concept of parole on a statutory basis.  I now propose to briefly discuss the general provisions of the Bill. As I did not have the resources of the Department of Justice and Equality at my disposal, I am conscious that there may be improvements that could be easily made to the Bill and I will be pleased to accept any such amendments that improve the Bill if and when it reaches Committee Stage. I have no doubt Members may have helpful amendments. I am pleased the Bill has received general support from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and Parole Board. Before discussing its provisions, I acknowledge the assistance I received in respect of the Bill from Niall Buckley, barrister-at-law, who provided me with help in drafting it. I will now refer to the mechanism of the Bill and the Parts into which it is divided. The Bill is divided into three Parts, the first of which deals with preliminary and general matters. The second Part deals with the Parole Board, its powers and composition, and the third Part deals with parole applications and how they should be appraised and determined by the Parole Board.  The first Part contains the standard provisions that appear in most legislation, including its Short Title and commencement. Since it is not a Government Bill, I have inserted a specific commencement date, although I recognise that commencement of Acts is governed by commencement orders signed by the Minister. In this case, it is important to try to keep to a timeline for having the legislation introduced. Section 5 sets out the nature of the parole process. The second Part deals with the Parole Board. The functions of the board, which will be established pursuant to section 6, are set out in section 7 and its objective is to convene panels to consider persons for parole and direct, if appropriate, that such persons be released on parole, subject to such conditions as may be set out by the parole order. The panels must require that persons released on parole be subject to periodic monitoring of compliance with parole conditions. They must also consider whether conditions need to be set. Obviously, some individuals will breach the terms of their parole conditions. For this reason, it is necessary that the Parole Board will have power to issue warrants for the purpose of apprehending and returning to custody persons who breach parole conditions. Section 8 deals with the membership of the Parole Board. It is proposed that the board will have 15 members. The board must have, as its primary objective, the insurance that individuals and society remain safe when individuals are released. However, we cannot ignore the other objective of imprisonment, namely, rehabilitation. For this reason, the 15 members should include a psychiatrist, psychologist, representative of the Irish Prison Service, Garda representative, probation or welfare officer, nominee of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and a number of other individuals who the Minister will appoint. It should be recognised, however, that the persons to be appointed must have knowledge or understanding of the criminal justice system and have the ability to make a balanced and reasonable assessment of risk.  The term of office of individual members should be for four years and they may be appointed for two terms. The chairperson should be a retired judge of the Circuit Court or higher, as proposed in section 10. There should also be individuals known as panel conveners because decisions in respect of parole must be made by groups within the Parole Board.The panels we are setting out would contain four board members and determine whether individuals would be granted parole. Section 12 deals with staffing. Obviously, there are issues. The last thing I want to do is create a giant quango that would produce glossy reports on an annual basis with public relations advisers and solicitors firms. What I have sought to do is simply replicate the system in place. There would need to be staff, but they could either be seconded by the Minister or, alternatively, hired by individuals. Section 13 deals with the parole panels, while section 14 deals with their powers. Their ultimate power would lie in determining whether individuals should be considered for parole. The Bill sets out a series of factors that would need to be considered in determining whether parole should be granted. Among the main factors are the conduct of the parole candidate to date and the risk of reoffending. Another power of the parole panels would be to receive submissions from any victim of the person whose parole was being considered. Sections 15 and 16 propose two mechanisms in the consideration of parole by a panel. It could undertake a review. It would be a documentary review because in many cases we might not need an oral hearing. The Parole Board could determine whether parole should be granted based on the documentary evidence. It would also have the ability to conduct an interview under this function. Section 16 deals with a situation where parole has been refused. An individual might wish to appeal such a decision or someone else might wish to have a matter heard. This would take the form of an oral hearing on whether parole should be granted. It would not be turned into a lengthy judicial-type process. We hope to have an informal process in place for the hearings. Part 3 of the Bill deals with the parole process and sets out the guiding principles. The main principle in every case is the safety of the community. Section 19 deals with the criteria for granting parole which are set out in considerable detail. Some of the factors to be considered include the nature and gravity of the offence, the term of imprisonment and what the trial judge said at the time. Section 20 deals with eligibility. Section 21 deals with consideration for parole, while section 22 deals with the parole order. A specific order must be made by the statutory body. This could be monitored under the monitoring and compliance provisions set out in section 23. The order could be varied under section 24 and revoked under section 25 if someone was to breach the terms of parole. Sections 26 and 27 deal with the preparation for hearings. There is a small amendment to the Defamation Act to protect members of the Parole Board from any claim for defamation arising from the publication of reports. That is a brief outline of the provisions contained in the Bill. I will now hand over to Deputy James Browne.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	339	In bringing forward this Bill Fianna Fáil is attempting to address a significant failing in the criminal justice system. A body that performs functions as important as the Parole Board which advises on whether convicted murderers and rapists should be released back into the community should be clearly defined and mandated in statute law. The basis of its decisions should be clearly examined and understood by the country, victims, offenders, the legal system and the Dáil. The failure to place the Parole Board on a statutory basis to date has meant that its functions do not have the force of law and only presents advice to the Minister. This puts an unfair burden on the Minister in dealing with the core issues involved. The Minister should be freed to focus on tackling crime and bringing forward legislation without having to deal with an issue that should be dealt with by specialists. Such specialists should be able to apply statute law and ethics in the interests of the community. They should be able to balance the rights of victims and offenders who have shown an ability to reform, have an understanding of their offences, demonstrate regret and perhaps deserve a conditional opportunity to move back into the community. The fact that the Minister deals with these matters can impact on public confidence in the administration of justice and key areas such as the separation of powers. Communities are often left in the dark as to why someone is being given parole, the terms and conditions, who is and is not entitled to it. The Bill seeks to resolve that conflict. The Parole Bill 2016 would place the Parole Board on a statutory basis. It would provide carefully for the membership of the board and set out the criteria to be used in granting parole that would be clear and transparent. People would be able to see why some offenders were given parole and the terms set. It would put an end to the rumour and innuendo that can arise from time to time. That could only help. There is a lack of trust in institutions in our modern society and we need to work towards rebuilding it. We can do this by having transparency and allowing people to see why decisions are being taken and for whom. That is critical. Importantly, the Bill also sets out the protections that would be afforded to local communities if a decision was made to permit a prisoner to return early to his or her community. Our primary concern must always be the community. People must be able to see why offenders are being released. The Fianna Fáil Bill has victims at its centre and would enshrine significant rights and supports in law. The Parole Board would be obliged to take into account all relevant information, including victim impact statements. That is critical. Victim impact assessments and statements have been brought into the court system. This is critical to give a voice to victims of crime. They provide for an element of balance. Previously, victims were often voiceless within the court system. They were almost forgotten about once the matter was put into the hands of the court. Victim statements have become important and this philosophy is being carried into the Parole Bill. The impact of a particular crime on victims will be taken into consideration. People are often convicted under straightforward criminal legislation, but the same crime can have remarkably different impacts on victims, depending on its nature and how it was carried out. We see this reflected in different sentencing parameters. The greatly increased transparency would allow victims and the public to access information more easily on the policies and decisions of the Parole Board. That is important because it would ensure consistency. While different Governments, parties and Ministers have always done their best to provide for consistency, it has been easy for someone to point the finger and ask why a given person was able to get out. The Bill would ensure greater transparency. This is important legislation which would benefit communities. It is welcome that the Government has decided to support it. It is an example of what can be achieved in the new political dynamic. Now well researched and well thought out legislation can be brought forward. Governments have a heavy burden in bringing forward legislation. Ministers in Fianna Fáil Governments were very hands-on in their Departments and constituencies. The new dynamic allows Members on all sides of the Dáil to bring forward legislation which, perhaps, Ministers might not have the time to produce in the normal course. Fianna Fáil is introducing the Bill to confer responsibility for granting parole to an independent statutory body. It takes away the de facto parole system that operates at the discretion of the Minister. It operates with a non-statutory Parole Board that advises the Minister on the suitability for temporary release and parole of persons referred to the Minister by the board. Fianna Fáil believes a body that performs the important functions of the Parole Board, in advising on the release of convicted killers and rapists and other serious criminals, should be clearly defined and organised under statute. The board should be independent and transparent. It should give confidence to the community in respect of the basis on which people are granted temporary release. The failure to place the board on a statutory basis has meant that important functions carried out by the board have been denied the force of law. The current set-up merely constitutes a form of advice provided for the Minister. The Bill would put the board on a statutory footing. This has proved particularly problematic since prisoners who believe they have an entitlement to parole can seek to avail of that entitlement. This must also be considered.Prisoners who feel they have been denied parole wrongly take actions into our courts which place a significant financial burden. The Bill is well thought out and outlines a clear set of criteria to prevent those kinds of actions in the future. It will help to free up judicial time and free up money going into our courts and justice system that is badly needed in other areas, which would be most welcome. Too much money is being spent in our courts system. We need to find better ways of resolving these issues without spending huge amounts of money on court cases. The Bill is important for the criminal and judicial system. It is important for communities. It is very worthy legislation. I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan on introducing it. I welcome the Government's support for it. It shows what we can achieve in the new dynamic within this Parliament. I am glad to support it.

It is undoubtedly a comprehensive Bill and while we will not oppose it on Second Stage, there are a number of points in it that may benefit from further consideration on Committee Stage. Establishing the Parole Board on a statutory basis has been a policy objective for some time and it is therefore not something the Government wishes to oppose in principle. I have publicly stated that I had intended to develop and bring forward legislative proposals providing for a statutory parole board and the commitment was in the 2016 Fine Gael manifesto earlier this year. The draft legislation which my Department had been working on was intended to set out the board's functions, powers and structure. As with the Bill before the House, the objective was a more effective and streamlined parole process which, while being of benefit to the prisoner, will always have public safety as a paramount concern. I wish to give some background to this issue. As long ago as December 2000, the then Taoiseach informed Dáil Éireann of the Government's intention to bring forward legislation to establish a parole board. In 2001, one of my predecessors as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, John O'Donoghue, established the Parole Board on an administrative basis. It was envisaged at that time that the non-statutory board would operate for a number of years, with a view to the board gaining experience prior to being placed on a statutory footing. The penal policy review group, which was established in 2012, produced a report accepted by the previous Government recommending establishing the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis. The previous Government agreed, in principle, to proceed with the implementation of that recommendation. So we are agreed on the broad principle of establishing the Parole Board on a statutory basis. The Law Reform Commission agrees with this proposal and the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in its report of March 2013 made the same recommendation. As it is currently constituted, the function of the Parole Board is to advise the Minister for Justice and Equality on the administration of sentences of persons whose cases have been referred to the board. The board informs the Minister of the prisoner's progress to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence. The focus is very much on the rehabilitation of prisoners and getting offenders to the stage where they are ready to integrate into society without posing a danger and having served an appropriate period of imprisonment. The Minister considers in full all recommendations when making the final decision on sentence management. Where temporary release is recommended, the board also advises the Minister of the conditions which should attach to any such release. I acknowledge that this Private Members' Bill is well drafted and intended to address the long-standing policy objective of an independent parole board. I will refer to a number of issues in the time available to me. Section 7 sets out the functions of the parole board and provides that the board shall, if appropriate, direct prisoners to be released on parole and, where necessary, also determine that such parole orders be suspended or revoked. As it stands, the power to release prisoners early is vested solely in the Minister for Justice and Equality. Section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951 allows the Government to exercise the power to commute or remit conferred by Article 13.6 of the Constitution on the President - except for capital cases - and in turn delegates that power to the Minister for Justice and Equality. Legal advice obtained in the context of my Department's ongoing work on its own parole Bill has raised considerable doubt as to whether the Government's power to remit sentences in a parole system could, at a constitutional level, be devolved. We need to have discussions on whether it could be devolved in full to an independent parole board and the implication of this for the proposals in the Bill would need to be carefully considered. It was something that had arisen in the preparation of our legislation in the area. We have not reached a final conclusion on that but no doubt it would be a point of discussion. While not directly related, if the power to release prisoners convicted of our most serious offences is to be transferred to a body not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, should consideration be given, for example, to setting out a minimum period of imprisonment to be served in the case of a sentence of life imprisonment? Implicitly, the Bill imposes a minimum period of imprisonment to be served in the case of life sentence prisoners in so far as the Bill follows the existing administrative procedure whereby review for parole arises after seven years have been served. In practice under the existing administrative arrangements, this initial review is simply the start of a process to prepare a prisoner for potential eventual release and there may be a number of reviews before a person is released. The reference in the existing non-statutory process to a review after seven years has led to concerns among victims' families. I agree with the points made by both previous speakers. In line with the victims' directive, we need to provide for the perspective of victims' families and other relevant people in granting parole. That has probably not received adequate consideration over the years and needs to be far more central now. If we include that now in primary legislation without addressing these matters it could not only aggravate matters for victims' families but may also lead to the new parole board having to justify in court why a life-sentenced prisoner is not being released after seven years. The Bill also proposes that the parole process would take on a more legalistic, quasi-judicial hue, which may conflict with the intended rehabilitative role of the board. The thrust of the Bill is that the new parole board would decide if and when a prisoner would be released. It does not put much emphasis on looking at the future administration of the sentence, which often falls short of release and involves recommendations about different forms of therapeutic interventions, attending particular work and education programmes and so on. That role of the parole board should remain and I imagine that Deputy O'Callaghan would have little difficulty with that. The Bill proposes that the chairperson should be a person who is, or has been, a judge of the Circuit Court or of the superior courts, that person being nominated by the Chief Justice. Currently, the chair of the Parole Board is a solicitor. Further, existing arrangements provide for four members of the Parole Board who would be described as community representatives. It is important to have strong lay representation on a board to bring the perspective of the layperson as opposed to somebody immersed in the legal or judicial system in these decisions. In essence, section 11 provides that these community representatives will be replaced by lawyers appointed through a competitive process. It provides that these four members be appointed as panel convenors who must either have held office as a judge of the District or Circuit Court, or be a practising barrister or solicitor. We need to discuss the appropriate membership carefully because I am very conscious of the risk assessments involved when making these kinds of decisions and the interplay of expertise needed. Having said that, my experience is that the risk assessments are given a lot of consideration within the Prison Service and in the Probation Service. I do not have much time to go into the detail of some of the other points I would like to make. Section 16 provides that a person whose parole is being considered is entitled to appear, give evidence and make submissions to the panel; attend while a person other than the victim is making a submission; be represented by a solicitor or, with the permission of the panel, by counsel; and have a character witness in attendance.I will make the point in summary that this is very different from the situation at present. While written legal representation can form part of a dossier, no legal representation is allowed at the interview stage or when the case is considered by the full board. I have no doubt that in some circumstances, it would be appropriate for a prisoner to have access to legal aid. I would be concerned if the parole process were to take on the attributes of an adversarial system in full. Obviously, that would lead to a significant charge on the Exchequer. In addition, it could do away with some of the benefits of the existing parole process. I think we need to consider and tease out these issues. At present, there is no such thing as a parole order along the lines of the order proposed under section 21. Recommendations from the Parole Board are made to the Minister, who decides on each case on the basis of the board's recommendation. The Minister's power to release derives from the Criminal Justice Act 1960, which provides for all temporary release. At present, this mechanism is used for releasing prisoners on a full-term basis and is often termed "full temporary release" or "reviewable temporary release". As things stand, neither the Parole Board nor indeed the term "parole" exists in statute. That is precisely the point the Deputy is making. I have a number of points to make on sections 22 and 26 and I will communicate directly with the Deputy in that regard. I would welcome clarity on the provisions of section 23, which provides for the Parole Board to monitor a person's compliance with his or her conditions of parole. Currently, a person who has been released is subject to monitoring by the Probation Service. It would be interesting to hear whether it is intended that this role will transfer to the Parole Board. The Probation Service is doing some very effective monitoring work at present. Obviously, it is critical and important that there is ongoing monitoring and feedback to the Prison Service and the Minister in cases when very difficult decisions are being made about releases. That information needs to be transferred in a very timely way. The Probation Service has had very good experience of doing this over the years. While I have raised a number of issues regarding this legislation, I acknowledge that it is consistent in principle with my party's policy and with long-standing Government policy. I thank Deputy O'Callaghan again for introducing this Bill. We should have further discussions on the various issues that have been raised. I will conclude by acknowledging the work of the current Parole Board, its chairman, John Costello, and all the members of the board, who give sterling service on difficult assessments and cases.

I hope the Deputy in question is aware of this so that he or she can come to the Chamber. I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for sending me a copy of this legislation and the explanatory memorandum that accompanies it. When he first published the Bill, he offered to meet me to go through its provisions if I wished to do so. I also recognise that when the Minister published the legislative programme - I think it was the week before last - she flagged that she is in the process of drafting her own parole Bill. The Minister raised some issues and gave us some useful information regarding the constitutional position in respect of one section of the Bill. In broad terms, we would agree completely with the proposal before us this afternoon. I know it has been a long-standing position of the Government that the parole process should be placed on a statutory footing. As I have said, the Government is in the process of providing for this through its own Bill. In fairness, the explanatory memorandum that comes with this Bill is very detailed. Section 8 of the Bill proposes that the Parole Board should have 15 members. We can debate whether 15 is the correct figure. Perhaps it should have more or fewer members. Deputy O'Callaghan can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding of the composition of the board. He said in his contribution that the chairperson should be a retired judge of the Circuit Court or higher, nominated by the Chief Justice. However, the legislation provides that the chairperson shall be a current or former judge. I wonder if we could get some clarification on that. Is it possible that a serving judge could be the chairperson of the board? Deputy O'Callaghan's legislation also outlines a number of individuals who should serve on the board, including a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust. I would be concerned that the Bill does not provide that someone from the civil liberties side of the debate should be represented on the board. Maybe this is something we can address on Committee Stage. I do not think it is a huge issue on Second Stage. I certainly believe the composition of the board warrants further consideration on Committee Stage. The Minister suggested that this Bill proposes to replace the community representatives on the board with people who come from a completely legal background. I do not know whether that would be a wise or an appropriate thing to do. If one is looking at the granting of parole, one will need a balanced view. One will certainly need a community view, given that we are going to be asking people to integrate back into the community. It is very important that the community should have a say in that respect. I want to touch on section 16 of the Bill, which outlines how the hearings will be conducted by the parole panel. It provides that "hearings shall be conducted in such manner as the parole panel thinks fit and the parole panel may receive submissions and such evidence including oral evidence as it thinks fit". It further provides that decisions by panels conducting hearings "shall be in writing and shall include reasons" and lists the people to whom copies of such decisions "shall be provided". Section 16(4) provides that if the panel's decision "is to decline to make a parole order in respect of a person, the decision shall specify a date at which the person shall next be considered for parole, not later than 2 years from the date of the decision". I would have some questions in that regard. I do not have an issue with the timeframe, as it is something that can be debated, but I think some flexibility needs to be built into the system. I do not know how the case of a terminally ill prisoner who was declined parole at a hearing before having a sudden change in circumstances - he or she might now have just a couple of months to live - could be dealt with if legislation provides it is not possible for someone to have another hearing within a two-year period. Maybe we can have further discussions on this aspect of the Bill. I do not even know how we would legislate for the flexibility that would be desirable in such circumstances. I certainly think it is something we need to discuss further. This Bill proposes that there should be a review every three months to ensure those who have been granted parole are complying with the terms of that parole. I would have concerns about how such compliance could be monitored. As the Minister outlined, this is currently done by the Probation Service. This legislation proposes to transfer that power to the Parole Board. I do not know how that will work in reality. While we are not going to oppose the Bill on this basis, we believe greater consideration should be given to this aspect of the matter. I accept that the Parole Board needs to have the power to set the conditions of parole but I emphasise that the conditions in question need to be realistic. It may be one of the conditions of parole that the person who has been released must reside at a particular address but it may subsequently transpire that he or she is no longer able to reside at that address for some reason, perhaps through no fault of his or her own. This is particularly likely to happen in the current climate, when people are being evicted from properties and families are losing their family homes on foot of bank repossessions.While technically they have breached their conditions, there needs to be some flexibility built so the Parole Board, when reviewing those conditions, can actually change them as the prisoner progresses. The Bill states one reason why somebody should be considered for parole is if it would enhance their employment opportunities. It would be important if we could also insert a provision to allow for parole to enhance maintaining family connections and ties. Section 26 provides for the board to issue a warrant authorising a member of An Garda Síochána to apprehend or return to prison a person released on parole on the revocation of a parole order. This is currently in the Minister’s power. Giving that power over to the Parole Board, albeit on a statutory footing, warrants further consideration. I am not too sure how the Bill actually got past First Stage because, technically, any Opposition legislation which would incur a cost on the Exchequer usually does not get past First Stage. Not only does this Bill have such a cost, it actually sets out expenses, how the proposed agency will be funded and the secretariat staff applied to it. I congratulate Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for getting around the system. Maybe I will give him a telephone call later on how to do this because it is the first time I have seen Opposition legislation which refers to costs not ruled out of order. Saying that, this is a good development and I hope a precedent set by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.

This is a change. Normally, Opposition legislation is ruled out of order if it is a cost to the Exchequer, a procedure with which I always disagreed. This is a matter which should have been addressed during the recent review of how the Oireachtas works. If this does set a precedent, I will certainly welcome it. Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill. However, we hope it just does not go to committee while the Government's Bill is being drafted. Accepting Bills for the sake of it and leaving them on the shelf on Committee Stage would not be in keeping with the new politics of this House. I hope the Minister will not do that because there is nothing more frustrating. The only thing more frustrating than getting a Bill ruled out of order is actually getting it past Second Stage, but then having it sit on Committee Stage until the Government brings in its own legislation. We would certainly like to see this legislation progressed through Committee Stage. Obviously, it will not be done in the near future as there is much work to be done on it, some of which was outlined by the Minister earlier. It is a comprehensive Bill, however. If Government amendments can be incorporated into this legislation, then it would save the Minister's office and the Parliamentary Counsel much time not having to draft a brand new Bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	I genuinely welcome this Bill and commit my party’s support throughout its legislative process. I hope there will be a continuation of the legislative process. We are all in new territory now and the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot stop this Bill, even if she wanted to. I congratulate Fianna Fáil for devoting resources, parliamentary time and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's skills to producing a thoughtful and well worked out set of proposals that are of central importance to the criminal justice system but are hardly populist or headline-grabbing. It has been long-standing Labour Party policy to put both the Prison Service and the Parole Board on a statutory basis, independent of the Department of Justice and Equality. The Minister knows my strong personal views in this regard, as well as those of the Labour Party over many years. We have recently been debating in this Chamber the need for Garda reform. This was not just a call for change for change’s sake. We want a root-and-branch examination of the entire criminal justice system to ensure we can be more effective in how we deal with the moderate manifestations of criminality and how it affects communities, especially vulnerable communities. We want to see more gardaí on the ground, patrolling our neighbourhoods. This outcome, however, can only be achieved with the comprehensive reforms analysed and presented for An Garda Síochána. Accordingly, we need changes in structure, organisation and management to ensure the most effective deployment of the Garda. We see the reform agenda as a bottom-up process which will affect the way we deal with every governmental service. That is just the beginning. The fight against crime includes straightforward Garda-related targets such as improved detection and arrest rates, use of modern technology and smart policing. It also involves the efficient and fair processing of trials and, crucially, arriving at the correct balance of deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation. An approach to crime cannot be structured exclusively at confrontation. It must also target, as far as possible, the actual elimination of crime. This means effective policing, reforms in the way the courts work, improvements in the Prison Service and greater emphasis on the Probation Service. The State must also tackle with equal vigour the social conditions which give the criminal milieu its energy. There have been many debates recently about north inner city Dublin. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality had an opportunity to go there last night. We must look at crime not in isolation but in a holistic way. We are beginning to do this with north inner city Dublin. However, that has to have manifestation right across our country. The Labour Party has long argued for major changes in a crucial set of relationships, namely those between the Garda, the Prison Service, the Department of Justice and Equality, the courts and the probation and welfare service. All of this needs to be examined fundamentally and made subject to much more Oireachtas accountability. There is an equal need for a wide range of educational, social and economic measures aimed at ending social deprivation and alienation. Our prison system is antiquated, expensive and ineffective. The reformation and rehabilitation of offenders is, at best, sporadic and, at worst, non-existent. In far too many cases, prison does little or nothing to reform its regular inhabitants completely, to get them back to a crime-free life and to have a sense of social responsibility. We support the establishment by statute of an independent prisons agency with the function of managing prisons coherently and in a planned and effective manner.The agency should be autonomous in its operations and should be accountable to the Oireachtas. We need a new management structure that would devolve greater autonomy and responsibility to prison governors in the management of and planning within their own institutions. The Irish Prison Service has its own brass plate and logo, but it remains simply a division of the Department of Justice and Equality. Prison governors are middle-ranking civil servants within the structure of the parent Department, with no real autonomy. New prison legislation should also repeal and consolidate all existing statutes, many of which date from the 19th century. The role and status of visiting committees should be upgraded in the legislation. Of course, as this Bill provides, the advisory committees which deal with the release of long-term prisoners should be placed on a statutory basis as a parole board, as envisaged by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan. In recent decades the Irish prison population has been increasing in comparison to that in other western European countries. However, a significantly larger percentage of the population have received and served a prison sentence. In other words, we have been sending a relatively larger number of people to jail than we used to in order to serve relatively short sentences. The alternatives to prison, particularly for minor crimes, are not used in this jurisdiction to anything like their potential, yet we cannot argue that a policy of more or less immediate recourse to imprisonment as a short, sharp shock has the appropriate deterrent effect. Our recidivism rate is still unacceptably high. Left to its own dynamic, the prison population will always expand to fill the number of spaces available, as has been proved dramatically in the United States. Therefore, inevitably, there will be overcrowding and the number of prisoners will increase in an unplanned way, a number of whom will require early release, which gives rise to humanitarian and other considerations. In this House we need to examine and address the issue of sentencing policy and the desirability of a policy of incarceration. A comprehensive review should be undertaken by the Oireachtas of sentencing options, with a view to better co-ordination of penal and sentencing policy. I also mention the probation and welfare service, the Cinderella service of the Department of Justice and Equality. It continues to be under-staffed, with the result that there are too many people in prison who do not need to be there because the resources are not available to deal with them in the community through the probation and welfare service. This should be the primary target of additional resources in dealing with the issue of sentencing. The service also needs to be placed on a statutory basis, to operate independently and with a clearly defined role. We need serious action on a programme for the reintegration of prisoners once released from prison. This means a comprehensive rehabilitation programme and sentence management, based on the individual needs of released prisoners. Such a programme should plan for reintegration as the norm, enabling prisoners to make well informed choices and assess their personal and educational skills. We should have a robust mechanism to treat mental health problems among prisoners, given that this is a growing problem and a real issue in prisons. I believe the previous Government did begin to make real progress in implementing the principle that a sentence of imprisonment should be regarded as a sanction of last resort. Community-based sanctions are significantly less costly and, more importantly, have less of an impact on recidivist prisoners. There is great urgency to tackle the conditions associated with and the causes of crime. As I said, the Tánaiste has visited the north inner city. We have to see the crime issue in the round. I look forward to the debate on the Bill, but I also look forward to much more cross-party grappling with the issue of crime to ensure we deploy resources through the budgetary decisions of this Parliament that would really impact on reducing crime levels into the future. I thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for introducing the Bill.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	346	We would welcome the placing of the Parole Board on a statutory footing and making it independent of the Government. We welcome the Bill's intention to have clarity and transparency on the decisions to grant parole to those serving long sentences. A more transparent and structured parole system would assist in the rehabilitation of prisoners by giving an incentive for good conduct and engagement in programmes, training and services in prison, which should be welcomed. The other aspect of the Bill - the ability of victims of crime to make submissions and be heard in the process - has long been called for and is also to be welcomed. As this legislation would apply to those serving longer sentences, the persons being considered for parole have committed quite serious crimes that have had a major impact on the lives of victims. It is, therefore, appropriate that the victims be heard and that the impact on their lives be considered in the conditions for release. We would also welcome the input of psychologists and other professionals with expertise in dealing with the rehabilitation of prisoners. A number of ideas from groups such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust appear in the Bill but others do not. I ask Deputy Jim O'Callaghan why this is the case and that these other ideas be given consideration on Committee and subsequent Stages. For example, we think it is important that risk assessments carried out by the Garda as part of the process not be carried out by gardaí who had been directly involved in the case, as clearly there is a danger, or at the very least a perceived danger, of bias. There need to be strict protocols or controls to ensure re-sentencing would not occur in the parole process.  We also question the extent to which exceptional cases may be considered, for example, prisoners with a terminal illness or cases involving other exceptional humanitarian grounds. There is a danger that, in detailing in primary legislation the grounds for parole, the Deputy may not allow sufficient flexibility to deal with such cases when they come before the Parole Board. In reintegrating prisoners back into society resources need to be made available to provide support for prisoners coming out of prison. We need proper investment in education and training programmes, as well as adequate counselling services and services provided by psychologists, both in prison and for newly released prisoners. I want to make a wider point on crime. The Bill would obviously apply to those who have been sentenced for quite serious crimes which carry a term of imprisonment of eight years or more. However, the vast bulk of those in prison are there for lesser crimes. Crime is, undoubtedly, a real scourge for many communities - working class communities, in particular, but not exclusively. Many people are deeply impacted on by crime and can live in fear of crime which affects their quality of life on a daily basis. A core point that has to be made when discussing crime is that we need to move past the most immediate crime to say the breeding ground for crime is poverty, social exclusion and inequality. The evidence is irrefutable if one compares the levels of equality in different countries or areas. If we want to deal with crime in the long run, we have to build a society in which everybody will have decent opportunities in life and be able to avail of a decent standard of living. People should not be living in deprivation and there should not be the mass inequality we witness. In dealing with crime when it happens custodial sentences are not the appropriate response to a wide variety of crimes and can actually be extremely counter-productive in that they can lead to people becoming repeat offenders. This does not deal with the problem. It may appeal to some Shylock notion of getting a pound of flesh or some commodity view of crime in the sense that someone has to receive their punishment. In looking at how we should deal with crime from the point of view of society as a whole and avoiding it within society, in many instances, it has been empirically proved that this simply does not work. We need investment to create a future for young people, particularly to create decent jobs, provide training and resource the education system to provide a stimulating and an engaging education for all.Likewise, we need investment in youth services and to provide a future for everybody in our society. We will not oppose the Bill on this Stage, and we will consider amendments along the lines of what I have spoken about on Committee Stage and later.

There is a background to it, and the Irish Penal Reform Trust has long called for such a change and for the Parole Board to be put on a statutory basis. It was a key recommendation of the strategic review of penal policy in 2014. I thank Fianna Fáil for doing something about it. Generally the Bill is very good. I have no difficulty with it and I will support it. However, I will highlight a number of matters and perhaps they can be looked at on Committee Stage. Section 24 deals with the variation of a parole order. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a parole board which is completely independent of political control and of the Government, but section 24 states an order may be changed on the direction of a Minister. I would like this to be examined with regard to how it would infringe on the independence of the Parole Board. Sections 18 and 19 deal with the guiding principles and criteria for parole. I have no difficulty with these, and clearly the safety of the community, family and victim must be paramount before we release prisoners, but there seems to be an undue emphasis on the offence committed a number of years prior to the Parole Board seeing the prisoner. There is not enough emphasis on the risk assessment that pertains at the point where the Parole Board is making a decision on whether a prisoner should be released into society and whether there is a risk at that stage. It should be with regard to the risk posed at the time the decision is being made. I also have a question on the standard of proof to be applied with regard to the decision, which is not clear from what I have seen. I welcome the broad nature of the composition of the board. This has been repeatedly asked for by various lobby groups. The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has pointed out there is room for improvement with regard to community representation on the board. I ask for this to be examined on Committee Stage. The point has been made that our prisons are full of poor people, whether we like it or not. We can predict at a very early age who will end up in prison and this prediction has never changed. One might say poverty is no excuse for crime, and it certainly is not, but the fact that prisoners consistently come from a certain class and areas has been repeatedly pointed out to us by the very experienced former governor of Mountjoy Prison. The Government and Dáil have failed to look at this. White collar crime is treated completely differently. Deputy Howlin referred to a Government of chaos, but I do not see any chaos, and I hope that during the time we are here we will examine prison policy and how we send the same people to prison over and over again. As Deputy Paul Murphy said, it must occur to us that we are doing something wrong. It simply is not working if we send the same people to prison over and over again. When considering the Bill I ask that we examine the balance that must be struck when releasing somebody. The safety of victims and the community must be paramount, but what should be of equal value is the chance of rehabilitating the prisoner. Ultimately, this is what prison is for, in addition to protecting society. It is supposed to serve a rehabilitation role so that when somebody goes to prison he or she is better coming out than going in. I would like to see this in the Bill and it is something to which I will return. Professor Harry Kennedy of the Central Mental Hospital has pointed out we have only two beds per 100,000 people in the population, compared to England which has 7.5 beds per 100,000 people. Our prisons serve as emergency departments for people who are sick and who should be in hospital receiving treatment. This is not happening and is something we need to examine. I welcome the fact that prisoners would be entitled to legal representation at an oral hearing. The Bill also states a prisoner would be entitled to documentation, but it does not specify all documentation. This should be clarified. Are prisoners entitled to all documentation on which the decision will be made? This is paramount. It should not be just some documentation or relevant documentation, but all of the documentation on which the decision will be based. The section stating that a victim may be heard is extremely important, but how will this decision be made? Who will communicate with the victim? If we take somebody who has committed sexual abuse and there are a number of victims, on the practical side how will this be dealt with and how will the victims be notified? It is an essential element of the Bill, but on a practical level how will it be dealt with? I welcome the Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage.

It will be a surprise to many of my constituents in Dublin South West and to the wider public that there is such a strong political role in the granting of parole in the Irish system. In advance of this year’s general election, I held a number of public meetings on the subject of crime and burglaries, and the subject of parole was raised again and again by constituents. The current system of offering parole to prisoners is catered for in the Criminal Justice Act 1960 and has remained mostly unchanged for nearly 60 years. It gives full and discretional powers to the Minister of the day as to who is released on parole and when, with the Parole Board acting only in the capacity of adviser. The very fact a Minister effectively has the power to overturn a decision made by the Judiciary is not good practice. The manner in which parole is granted in the State and the fact that ultimate control of this system is given to a politician is outdated and in urgent need of reform. The term parole in the Irish context is used to refer to the temporary release of longer-term prisoners. However, there is no statutory definition of parole in Ireland. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1960, the Minister for Justice and Equality may grant temporary release to prisoners at any time before they qualify for standard remission or to life-sentenced prisoners who are not entitled to standard remission. In effect, there are two categories of temporary release. These are temporary release granted with a view to the person returning to detention, and full temporary release which is intended as ending the period of detention. At present, the Parole Board reviews the sentences of prisoners serving eight years or more and makes recommendations to the Minister as to whether the prisoner should be granted temporary release. The Parole Board advises the Minister for Justice and Equality of the prisoner’s progress, the degree to which he or she has engaged with therapeutic services, and how best to proceed with his or her sentence. However, the recommendations of the Parole Board are not legally binding and the decision to release a prisoner is made by the Minister. Furthermore, there are no clear guidelines on the criteria that indicate a prisoner’s eligibility for parole. According to statistics provided to Members recently, towards the end of 2014, 344 prisoners in Ireland were serving life sentences, 273 were serving sentences of ten or more years, and 726 were serving sentences of between five and ten years.The length of time served by prisoners on a life sentence increased from an average of 11 years for prisoners released in 2002 to 20 years for prisoners released in 2013. I welcome the Bill and the proposal that the Parole Board be placed on a statutory basis, with careful consideration being given to the appointment of members of the board. There have been many other calls for this measure to be taken. In 1997 an expert group on the prison service called for this measure to be implemented and in 2000 the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights called for it also. A study by Dr. Diarmuid Griffin of the School of Law in NUIG has also recommended that the Parole Board be placed on a statutory footing and given power to make decisions on releases. I particularly welcome the aspect of the Bill which pays particular attention to the views of the victim and the fact that the Bill would confer an obligation on any new Parole Board to take account of the views of the victim concerned. The Bill would rightly place an obligation on the Parole Board to supply any information available on the release from detention on parole of a prisoner to the victim and the general public. The overall aim of the Bill is to create safer communities by ensuring those released back into society are ready for this move and pose a very low risk of reoffending. This would be done by ensuring the members of the Parole Board were from a wide section of representative bodies. The Bill proposed by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan is to be commended and will I believe be welcomed by prisoners' rights advocates, members of the public and An Garda Síochána, all of whom have cause for disquiet under the existing system.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	350	I thank the House for agreeing to let Deputy John Lahart and I swap seats. We are moving ahead of time, but I want to add my voice to the debate on the Bill and compliment my colleague Deputy Jim O'Callaghan on bringing it forward. It is good to hear such positive contributions across the House. The Irish Penal Reform Trust, too, has added its weight behind the legislation. I noticed, while listening to the Minister, that she said it was her intention to bring forward proposals in this regard and that putting the Parole Board on a statutory basis was part of the Fine Gael manifesto. If one looks back to the 2011 programme for Government, however, there were many promises on legislation that remained unfulfilled, including in my area of responsibility during that term, including, for example, the information and tracing Bill on adoption. I do not say this in a critical manner, but I am saying the composition of the Dáil affords the Opposition parties a real opportunity to help and assist the Government which might not always be able to get its own legislation through the House. The Bill represents real and meaningful help from my colleague who, as I think everybody will experience, has the knowledge and experience to bring forward legislation such as this. When one considers the current position, it is effectively at the discretion of a Minister for Justice, on the advice of a non-statutory parole board, whether somebody should be given parole. That is not right and my party firmly believes a body that performs such important functions as advising on whether convicted killers or rapists should be allowed parole should be clearly defined and organised in the Statute Book. Whether we care to admit it, there are certain public representatives, Members of this Dáil, who could potentially serve as Minister for justice and who, as we witnessed in the last Dáil, of which I was a Member, refused to condemn murders and rapists. I certainly would not like to see people who are friendly with rapists and murderers serving in positions of authority or as Minister for Justice where the Parole Board was not on a statutory basis. It is, therefore, welcome that the Bill would provide that the Parole Board was fully independent and placed on a statutory footing, would remove the decision-making process from political control and ensure future decisions would be made in an open, transparent and consistent decision-making process. I noticed recently that a former Minister for justice had also alluded to the fact that previous members of the Parole Board had been appointed based on political connections. I do not say this in condemnation of the Government; I am sure it could just as likely have been a former member of my party. That is not right or proper and it is right that we have people with the necessary expertise such as psychiatrists, psychologists and welfare officers to make these decisions. It is welcome that the Bill would give significant rights to and provide supports for victims of crime because when we talk about the duration of sentences handed down, we are talking about the most heinous of crimes. The Bill would provide for an obligation to ensure the victims of crimes and their concerns would be addressed. I welcome what Deputies Brendan Howlin and Catherine Connolly said about the need for a wider debate on crime. The problems in the inner city are well known and have been receiving a lot of attention. It is also well known that most crimes are committed by people who tend to come from less well-off families. While the focus is on the serious problem being encountered in inner city areas, these problems are felt in every community and constituency, in every rural village and small provincial town. The extent to which drugs have taken over the country is simply phenomenal. We need to deal collectively with the consequences in the numbers of fights, assaults and burglaries. While it is welcome that there is a focus on what is happening in the inner city which rightly needs our attention, it cannot be done to the detriment of what is happening in rural Ireland.  I thank the Chair for his forbearance in making my contribution.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	353	During my period as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence in the past five years a subgroup of the committee produced a report on penal reform, with which I am sure Deputies are very familiar. While focusing on the need to address overcrowding in prisons, one of the recommendations made concerned the need to place the Parole Board on a statutory footing. The report, for which Senator Ivana Bacik was rapporteur, was published in March 2015. We travelled to Finland as part of the work involved where we visited prisoners because we had discovered its penal system was very advanced. One of the issues that arose from the report was the fact that the Parole Board here remains subject to political control and that this could result in a conflict with international human rights law. These were some of the points made in the report; therefore, the Bill is timely. A very important factor in ensuring the successful reintegration of an offender into the community is his or her structured and supported release from prison. Again, this formed part of the report.  Given that the Parole Board focuses on those prisoners serving longer sentences, it is essential that its role continue to focus on the administration of the offender's sentence from the time he or she becomes eligible for parole. In this respect, under existing arrangements, the Parole Board informs the Tánaiste of a prisoner's progress to date and the degree to which he or she has engaged with various services. It is this type of information that can inform how best to proceed in the future administration of the sentence. In particular, it is important to maintain a role for the Parole Board whereby it can provide practical advice and support to assist offenders in completing their sentences and returning to the community. I again pay tribute to organisations such as Care After Prison; the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders, IASIO; the Churchfield Community Trust and others which are doing a lot of work in supporting prisoners as they integrate back into the community.I would like the role of the Parole Board, the Probation Service and others to continue in that regard. The Bill is consistent with the primary concern of a parole board, which is the safety of the general public, and that the board operates under the obligation to be satisfied that the prisoner has addressed his or her offending behaviour and that any threat to the safety of the public or the community is minimised. The Bill provides, in its guiding principles, that the paramount consideration for the board in every case is the safety of the community. That said, I also support a more formal structure and basis for the Parole Board, and this Bill endeavours to provide that. Establishing a parole board on a statutory basis will ensure greater transparency and clarity at an operational level. We must ensure an even transition from an administrative to a statutory basis for parole and the best way of achieving this transition should be clarified before the legislation comes into force. I also welcome the fact the Bill envisages a role for the victims of offenders who are under review. An appropriate role for victims in the process is essential. An important consideration for the existing Parole Board has been the involvement of victims in the review. The Parole Board takes into consideration the views of victims and the impact of the offence on their lives before it makes a recommendation to the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, highlighted some of the issues in the Bill which would require further consideration, and I do not plan to repeat them. However, addressing these matters and the extent, or otherwise, of their implications is the purpose of the legislative process and I look forward to contributing to the process. I am sure Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Sinn Féin Chairman of the justice committee, will help Fianna Fáil by facilitating and prioritising the Bill. In particular, it is important we ensure that any proposals are constitutionally robust and that, where a role for the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Executive should be maintained, it is maintained. There has been a long-standing commitment on the part of successive Governments to putting the Parole Board on a statutory basis and that purpose will be widely supported inside and outside the House. As the Minister mentioned in her remarks, work has been ongoing in the Department of Justice and Equality on the formulation of similar proposals to create a statutory footing for the Parole Board. The provisions of the Bill and the debate today will inform that work. I pay tribute to everybody who has contributed to the debate so far today. It has been positive, structured, reflective and very important. As I said in the Seanad earlier, I agree with comments by colleagues who stressed the need, when we deal with crime, to look at the other side of the equation, building up communities and youth services and ensuring people follow through on education. I could not agree more with what Deputy Robert Troy said earlier about the role of drugs in communities across the country. He is correct. It is very corrosive and damaging and we must do all we can to focus on it from every angle to try to minimise the ongoing damage. Again, on behalf of the Minister and myself, I thank Deputy Jim O’Callaghan and the Members of this House. I also express my appreciation to Mr. John Costello, the chairman of the Parole Board, and the members of the board for their ongoing work in this area.

I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan on bringing forward the Bill. I expect it will be one of the first Bills to be passed by this Oireachtas. It will probably not be passed before the water charges legislation but it will possibly be passed soon after it. I look forward to it. It will be a significant achievement. There is much work to do between this and then. I am sure Deputy O'Callaghan is very much looking forward to Committee Stage of the Bill, as will other members of the justice committee. It will happen sooner rather than later, assuming Second Stage is passed today. Deputy O'Callaghan is doing something that was recommended a number of years ago by the Thornton Hall review group, which called for legislative proposals to be brought forward to establish the Parole Board on a statutory basis. It is important that the Parole Board be established on an independent, statutory basis and does not operate simply at the discretion of the Minister but does its job independently and well. We also think of the parole officers and staff around the country who do their work extremely well. We want to give them and the board independence. A body that can set free the most serious criminals must have its functions set down clearly and appropriately in legislation, which is not the case now. The legislation is extremely necessary and urgent. When we think of parole, we make a connection with freedom or cutting sentences short. However, the Bill and the independence and statutory basis of the Parole Board is needed in order to give victims of crime reassurance. The Bill gives victims rights and supports that are necessary. It is not about the criminal but about having a proper criminal justice system that ensures people are punished appropriately and, while all rights under the Constitution are recognised, that the rights of victims are recognised in particular. The Bill would create an obligation on the Parole Board to provide information that is accessible to victims and the general public about matters relating to people who are being released. These matters are often of great public controversy and little is known about how the system works. If there is legislation and a statutory footing, according to which the Parole Board must operate, rather than decisions being made by a Minister on an ad hoc basis, there will be more public confidence in the criminal justice system and how convicted criminals are dealt with subsequent to conviction. Given the strength of the Opposition, the collective will of the House and the fact that the Government has supported the Bill, the numbers are such that legislation such as this is likely to be passed and become part of our statutory framework. I hope our friends in government and in the Executive branch understand the concept completely. The Bill will have to go before a committee within ten weeks. I am not sure how that will work vis-à-vis any recess in August. It will be brought before the committee no later than September, or possibly earlier, given that the justice committee will have few items on its agenda when set up. It will have no backlog and this will be one of the first items on its agenda. It will require detailed analysis on Committee Stage. I would like it to have this careful analysis but for it to go through relatively quickly and return to the Dáil for Report Stage, which will not take too long, and then go to the Seanad where it will not take long. Then, it will be passed and we will have a new statutory body created by Opposition legislation. Some work will need to be done on this side preparing for Committee Stage and much work will need to be done by officials. I commend the officials who will have to do it and wish them well as they analyse the Bill. The Executive also has an important role in this. I commend Deputy O'Callaghan and look forward to the legislation being passed.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	355	I welcome the Parole Bill 2016 and commend Deputy O'Callaghan on bringing it forward. It is welcome legislation which is very practical and sensible and is not very controversial. It brings about a change which has been debated, discussed and sought for many years. It is very welcome and I am glad there is support across the House for it. It puts the Parole Board on a statutory footing, which is welcome given that it provides clarity and transparency. Citizens, those working in the legal system and the parole system and prisoners going through the system will know where they stand and how the system operates. It allows the Parole Board to be fully independent of political interference, which is welcome. The Bill clarifies the law in this area and helps us support a proper balance between the protection of the public, which is of key importance to every Member, and the upholding of the rights of prisoners who are sentenced. The fact the Parole Board has not been on a statutory basis has meant the recommendations or advice of the board was just a recommendation or advice to the Minister who could do with it as he or she pleased.I recognise that more than 80% of recommendations were accepted but this still vests a great deal of power in one individual and in the Cabinet which is never a good thing, particularly when dealing with issues of liberty that affect the lives of our citizens. The removal of that element of power is very much welcome. More fundamentally, people were uncomfortable that a member of the Cabinet was making decisions in respect of matters that were originally decided by the Judiciary. That trespasses on the separation of powers and the line was getting blurred in this regard, a view that was shared by many. The ad hoc basis on which parole is granted is an outdated way of operating an important aspect of our criminal justice system. I very much welcome the victims of crime element of the legislation. That can never be lost because behind every person's sentence is a crime and those affected by it. The victims deserve to be heard and have their views taken on board by the Parole Board. It is vitally important in ensuring citizens that their rights will be vindicated, that justice will continue to be served and that their views will be listened to at all times. I also welcome the recognition of the rehabilitation element of our justice system whereby we simply do not lock people up and throw away the key and we recognise that people can change with assistance and become proper functioning and contributing members of our society. Rehabilitation must play a role in our justice system, otherwise we will not have served the public's interest in the best way possible. We had an informal system to deal with a serious matter, which is the problem people had with it. The release of prisoners who had committed serious crimes before the end of their sentences is a crucial issue and it should be dealt with on a statutory basis. That is why we have such good support for the Bill. Seeking to ensure transparency in the way the Parole Board operates is a welcome aspect of the legislation. It is our role as parliamentarians to identify areas in which there is not clarity and transparency in our justice system and to address them. While it may not be the pressing issue of the day and it is not interesting or exciting for people, our work is important in this regard. It is essential to clear up these matters. That is why this is practical legislation, which addresses changes that are necessary in this grey area. It is good that a Fianna Fáil Bill will proceed to the next Stage and that it has gained cross-party support. It demonstrates in this era of new politics, which we have discussed a great deal over the past number of months, that changes are happening and it is important for the public to see that we are making such changes in a positive and practical way that will have an impact outside the Chamber. As a new Deputy, I very much welcome the implementation of these changes. When I meet members of the public, I can point to changes, new politics and the positive changes we are making in this Chamber.

The Lisbon treaty provides important power for national parliaments in the EU legislative process. Under its provisions, national parliaments have a right to object to EU draft laws in the form of a reasoned opinion. National parliaments must consider whether proposed new legislation complies with the principle of subsidiarity. This power must be used by national parliaments within eight weeks of the publication of proposed new EU legislation. The eight week deadline for this falls today. In the EU context, subsidiarity is a concept about the level of governance at which an action should be taken. It is based on the presumption that the action should be taken at the lowest level of governance consistent with the subject matter and the objective to be attained. The procedure set out in the Lisbon treaty is that if one third of national parliaments send reasoned opinions indicating that a proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity, the draft directive must be reviewed by the European Commission. The Commission can then decide to maintain, amend or withdraw the directive and must give reasons for its decision. Although this threshold is unlikely to be reached in this case, the committee is still of the belief that it is important for this Parliament to strongly express its view and to do so through a reasoned opinion. With regard to the background to this, the Dáil ordered the establishment of the Standing Order 112 Select Committee on 10 March. This was done to ensure that the Dáil had a voice on EU legislative matters. The committee was given responsibility to carry out the parliamentary functions associated with the Lisbon treaty. The committee first considered this proposal for a directive on 11 May and decided that the proposal needed detailed scrutiny. The committee sought and received submissions from stakeholders and these were considered on 1 June. The committee discussed the proposal for a third time in public session on 8 June with assistance from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. That Department conducted a public consultation which closed on 20 May. The committee was briefed on the summary results of this consultation. The committee sought submissions from a number of stakeholders ranging from Christian Aid to the Irish Tax Institute. In general, the same issues and concerns were raised in those submissions. Following this meeting of the committee, it was agreed that a reasoned opinion was justified in this case. On 9 June the committee met again and agreed the report that is now being debated. The report sets out the grounds for the Dáil to send a reasoned opinion to the EU institutions. As is clear from the committee's engagement, the decision to bring this matter to the House was not taken lightly. I understand this will be only the fifth time the Dáil has considered the adoption of a reasoned opinion under the treaty. The Commission's proposal in this case supplements a recently adopted directive on administrative co-operation which already obliges large multinationals to report taxes paid on a country-by-country basis to tax authorities and also provides for those authorities to share that information with each other. The Commission hopes that the publication of some of this information will allow public scrutiny of corporate tax arrangements. I believe it is fair to say that the committee is very supportive of this objective of the Commission and it made that view clear. The Commission proposal, if passed, will apply to multinational companies, European or not, which are based or have a subsidiary or branch in the EU, where they have a consolidated turnover of €750 million. It appears that somewhere between 47 and 95 companies with Irish based parents will fall within the scope of the proposal. Under the proposal, companies will be obliged to prepare a report that sets out the corporation tax that a multinational pays in each EU member state and where it operates. This is commonly referred to as country-by-country reporting. The same information must be provided for each non-co-operative tax jurisdiction in which the multinationals are active and, for the rest of the world, multinationals need only prepare or give an aggregate for all corporation tax paid. The proposal also provides that the Commission will prepare a list of non-co-operative tax jurisdictions. This will be done by delegated act, in consultation with the European Parliament and member states. This element of the proposal was developed by the Commission at a late stage in the drafting and was not part of the impact assessment. The committee's view is that any assessment of the tax status of countries is one for members states' own tax authorities and Finance Ministers, based on tax principles. EU Ministers for Finance have recently agreed to prepare a similar list for tax purposes. Having considered the proposal in great detail, and it is important to note the committee considered it in the context of subsidiarity, the committee agreed that issues of concern arise in terms of the principle of subsidiarity. I will summarise briefly the reasons the committee came to this conclusion. The committee is of the opinion that the proposal relates to tax policy rather than accounting practices, as tax policy is clearly a competency of member states, a breach of the principle of subsidiarity has therefore occurred on that basis. The committee also found that the Commission had failed to show that it is better placed than member states to develop a list of tax havens. On this basis the committee concluded that this action is a breach of the principle of subsidiarity.  Accordingly, I commend the committee's draft reasoned opinion that the proposed directive does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in the Lisbon treaty. If this draft reasoned opinion is agreed by the Dáil, it will constitute the House's formal response under the Lisbon treaty.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	359	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion on this EU proposal. Essentially, we need to set out, in layman's language, what the proposal contains. Under this EU proposal, it is proposed that companies with revenues in excess of a turnover of €750 million will be obliged to publicly disclose financial information for each country within the EU with which they do business. In addition to that, they will be asked to supply information regarding their turnover, taxes paid, profit before tax, number of employees, the nature of their activities and accumulated earnings. On the face of it, I believe some people would say that is a good idea. The problem with the way the EU has gone about bringing forward this proposal is that it has introduced it under a company law directive, but essentially the proposal before us is about taxation. The EU was disingenuous in introducing a taxation measure, trying to slip it in under a company law directive. That is essentially the reason our committee, on which I served with the chairman, has a problem with this. If the EU has said this is a taxation proposal and that it would put it through the relevant finance committees, it could have been debated for what it is but it tried to slip it in under a different heading. That was a sneaky move on its part and it deserves to be pulled up on it. It is also damaging to the EU and it is no wonder the people in England have a problem with the EU when this is how it goes about its business.  We discussed at the committee the fact that 6,000 companies across the EU could be affected by this proposal but it said that in Ireland up to 47 companies could be affected. We asked the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation how many of those 47 companies are indigenous companies such as Kerry Co-Op, Cement Roadstone and Glanbia, but it was not able to provide that figure. It said that neither Revenue nor the Central Statistics Office could give us the information and it referred us to The
Sunday Times
top 1,000 companies. That was the publication to which the Department referred the committee yesterday for us to establish how this proposal would affect Irish companies. All the members of our committee received that e-mail referring us to the top 1,000 companies in The Sunday Times supplement. They might have a look at that. It was the official response from the Department and was wholly inadequate. I am not criticising the Department exclusively for the problem here as the problem emanated with the EU.  Many people would say we need to increase taxation co-operation across EU level and to close off some of the loopholes referred to in regard to non-co-operative tax jurisdictions. To the rest of us, that is a tax haven. In European language, however, it is called a non-co-operative tax jurisdiction. They do not specify who decides who should be on this list, whether the list can change from country to country or whether one will be on it next year if one is on it this year. It is a badly thought out proposal on the part of the EU and an attempt to sneak it in under company law. Somebody in that section has an agenda in regard to taxation and should have been upfront that this was a taxation proposal. In that case, we would have dealt with it under the base erosion and profit sharing proposals being discussed at European level so that there can be harmonisation in regard to these taxation measures. However, they chose to go the opposite way because they know the Commission does not have competence to set taxation rates or interfere with taxation in regard to corporate or personal taxation rates in any of the EU member states. They decided to call it an accounting directive and slip a taxation measure in through the back door. They have been caught out on that. Already, our friends in Sweden, whom we met the other night, have issued a similar direction to the EU to the one we propose to approve this evening. Tonight is the last date for the Parliament to respond. I support the proposal that we should send an opinion to the EU to the effect that it is not within the competence of the EU to do this under the directive and if it wants to reconsider and come back to it properly at a later date, that is another day's work. They should not be doing it here now. I have grave concerns about the fact that we do not know what impact this will have on indigenous Irish business and, indeed, they have not even attempted to specify it. I revert to the comment I made a few minutes ago. It is no wonder that there is a referendum on Brexit in the UK. I have no idea if they will even have time to discuss it this week, but if people in Britain saw that this proposal was before the House of Commons, it would greatly help the Leave campaign if they saw what Europe was at behind their backs. I say to the eurocrats at the Commission who dream up these things, it is not for the good of the EU that they go about their business in this way. It harms the EU to go about business in this back-handed way. Thank God, there are alert committees in our Parliament and in the Swedish Parliament that can see what is going on. We are calling a halt and saying they do not have the authority to do this. They must go away and redraft.

Today's motion is a new level in hypocrisy. The EU Commission's proposal is a very modest attempt to bring more transparency to the tax affairs of very large companies. This State brought in country-by-country reporting in last year's Finance Bill but failed to make this reporting publicly available. The Commission's action would make that reporting public in the case of very large companies. Due to the austerity rules for which Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil argued, we are struggling to find special purpose vehicles to build homes for our friends and families, relying on strokes of luck from EUROSTAT to allow us keep our hospitals working to full capacity while the Taoiseach is writing begging letters to the EU to be allowed build the infrastructure every business in the country is crying out for. However, when it came to those rules, all parties in the State, bar a few, were willing to roll over. Suddenly, however, and because 47 huge companies will be asked to be a tiny bit more transparent about their taxes, we have a problem. This is hypocrisy on a huge scale and it will fool nobody. There is no party that has even the merest bit of credibility when it comes to protecting Irish sovereignty here compared to Sinn Féin. We engage critically with the EU and are proud to have stood for Irish sovereignty time after time. When our fishermen's and farmers' livelihoods, our natural resources or our neutrality are in question, there are no concerns about sovereignty from the parties that have swallowed the EU line time after time. This motion is not about subsidiarity, it is about protecting huge companies from having to put some of their tax affairs in the open. Only months ago, I proposed in the Finance Bill that Ireland introduce country-by-country reporting on a public basis. I was told we should wait because the EU and OECD were moving in that direction. Now that these bodies have done exactly what I was told to wait for, we are raising objections. The legal arguments put forward by the committee are weak. This is an accounting action, not primarily a tax proposal. No tax rate changes as suggested by Fianna Fáil are proposed. The use of the quote from the Commission referring to "tax policies and administration" in the report is a distortion. What it actually said was:In an increasingly global integrated and digitalised economy, corporations and production value chains reflect less national and indeed regional boundaries. By contrast, tax policies and administration remain primarily a national responsibility.That is what is in it. It is not this idea of a grab for tax control. The attempt at spin here can be seen through without much effort. The proposal is clearly referring to financial reporting in the context of cross-border abuses not tax affairs. Likewise the attempt to present the proposal to set up a blacklist as a power grab is politically motivated not legally motivated. We have to ask whether Ireland and so many other states are nervous about who might end up on such a list. I disagree strongly that the proposal in Article 28 exceeds the power given to the EU and see nothing in the report that makes me think otherwise. Scare-mongering around American reaction to this initiative can also be dismissed. It would be our preference that moves like this be made on a global rather than an EU scale, but until that time there is no excuse to not go with the progress that can be made. When it comes to cracking down on tax avoidance, the State is treading a fine line. Time after time, it has called for international co-operation and a cynic might say that was a delaying tactic. When the international co-operation happens and an EU proposal for the implementation of internationally agreed standards on financial reporting comes before us, the establishment political parties start to wave a yellow flag, shouting about subsidiarity and sovereignty. It is not credible. It is time for real debate in this country about our relationship to the international tax system. How many times was I told we could not act to end companies declaring themselves stateless or that we could not close the double Irish and had to wait for our international partners to move? Yet, it happened and we were able to do it. Development charities have correctly pointed out the real impact of facilitating tax avoidance. They have made practical suggestions as to what the State can do domestically to be a fairer player in international tax matters. I hope the Government will move on this issue. Sinn Féin rejects this motion. It is a political attempt to hide behind an honourable concept. Fundamentally, this is not about Ireland's interest or the interests of Irish workers; it is about protecting the interests of 47 massive companies, which will survive in any event.

With respect, I do not see how it does so. Subsidiarity is defined such that in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union can act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states either at central level or at regional and local level but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level. I would have thought it was clear that this is a matter where agreed objectives cannot be achieved by the member states acting alone and where EU action is, therefore, needed. I note that the committee is supportive of measures encouraging greater corporate social responsibility generally, including measures providing for fair and transparent accounting and reporting arrangements by large corporations. That position is welcome. The only argument that this is a tax measure rather than an accounting measure is in the committee's questioning of the use of an amendment to the accounting directive as the appropriate means of achieving its objective in this case. To note the fact that an accounting directive is proposed to be amended is to miss the point.The legal basis for this proposal, as stated by the Commission, is Article 50 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which relates to the right of establishment and the setting out by directive of harmonised conditions for the exercise of that right or rights. I agree with the Commission that, in an increasingly global and integrated economy, enterprises can easily relocate their tax bases from one jurisdiction to another within or outside of the Union. The EU's action is justified in order to address the cross-border dimension where there is aggressive tax planning or transfer pricing arrangements. There is a growing international consensus about the need for greater tax transparency. This proposed directive aims to enhance transparency and public scrutiny of corporate income tax by adapting the existing legal framework concerning the obligations imposed on companies and firms in respect of annual reports. It clearly does not concern the harmonisation of taxes, only obligations to publish reports on income tax information. I have been a strong supporter of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, although achieving sufficient progress in that regard has been slow and difficult. The Panama papers have disclosed extraordinary levels of aggressive tax evasion, avoidance or whatever one wants to call it. In many countries, the tax bases are increasingly being eroded. The committee received a detailed submission from Christian Aid setting out the consequences of this, particularly for developing countries. Unless we develop the collective will to publish a relatively modest amount of additional information in annual reports and such like, it is difficult to see how there could be any level of accountability on the part of what are, by any standard across the Union, very large enterprises. This situation can only be progressed if countries act together. We need to consider people's best interests globally in this respect. When we do, we will see the answer. If everyone has a mé féin, beggar my neighbour attitude, we will find it almost impossible to make progress on BEPS or any other element that seeks to bring additional transparency to what some large multinational corporations are aggressively doing, according to the limited information contained in the Panama papers, to avoid making any tax payment in almost every jurisdiction on what are by global standards extraordinary profits.

It is extraordinary that the only reason we are even debating this motion now is because I telephoned the Chief Whip's office yesterday morning to ask why there was to be no debate on this measure, an EU proposal, demanding country-by-country public reporting of the profits and affairs of the wealthiest multinationals. It is extraordinary that even some of those who have spoken against the Government motion are members of the committee that agreed it. Where was the dissent on this matter at the committee? It would have allowed the motion to pass yesterday without any debate on what constituted a minimal effort to require country-by-country transparent reporting and a blacklist of tax havens, which are correct and long-overdue measures. They do not go far enough, but at least they are moving in the right direction. Incredibly, the Government, Fianna Fáil and whoever else was on the committee went along with the idea that this measure should be blocked on the spurious grounds of subsidiarity, the rubbish notion that it transgresses into the area of tax policy. It is purely an accounting measure, one that requires multinationals operating across national borders to say where their profits are being generated. This is not a tax policy or tax measure. It simply addresses the deliberate and systematic hiding and shifting of profits by multinationals that are involved in staggeringly obscene tax evasions and in robbing the taxpayers of this country of tens of billions of euro and the taxpayers of the world of hundreds of billions of euro every year. When one asks why we have a housing crisis, a health crisis or growing poverty and inequality, the answer is that the wealthiest multinationals in the world do not believe in paying taxes, pay accountants to avoid paying them systematically and have certain governments, including ours, in their pockets to ensure that they get away with tax avoidance. This is happening belatedly and under pressure from the people, not the European Commission. People were angry at what happened in the recession, including the austerity and culpability of large corporate entities for it. They have demanded that there be some transparency and action in order to deal with corporate tax avoidance by the multinationals. In public statements, the Irish political establishment has claimed to be in favour of these measures but at its first opportunity to implement measures that would shine a light on the multinationals' massive systematic tax avoidance, it has moved to block them, cover up the situation and prevent a debate in the House. Similarly, the cameras at the finance committee were turned off for our discussion on whether to have Apple attend to explain its tax affairs in this country. That is the level of the collusion by the political establishment. The media is asleep at the wheel. This is the most important topic that has been discussed in the Dáil this week, yet it is the shortest debate. We would not even have had a debate but for the fact that we raised the matter. We are discussing billions of euro, yet there was not even going to be a debate. The establishment will now close ranks and push this through on a technicality in order to block a reform measure on what is the most important of areas. There is a direct correlation between poverty, unemployment, the crisis in our public services and growing inequality globally, and the ongoing practice of multinationals in this matter. The Irish political establishment has closed ranks, shut down debate, covered up the situation and colluded with people. It is outrageous. Thanks to the oversight of the left in this country, some alarm bells are being rung about the issue, there will be a vote and there has been some debate, albeit a ridiculously short-circuited one.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	366	I acknowledge Deputy Boyd Barrett's role in forcing what is a limited discussion, but at least the issue is being partially aired. I agree with his points, in that it is an indictment of our Chamber that this could have happened without any discussion on these serious proposals. We are debating the European Commission's latest attempt to introduce greater transparency in the reporting of multinational corporations. As we have heard, the committee asserts that the proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity, which is utter rubbish and would not stand up to any scrutiny whatsoever.It has been exposed, even by the arguments that have been heard in the House, as a veiled excuse to cover what are in reality very minor baby steps towards delivering some sort of tax transparency and tax justice. These are enormous issues with considerable implications in Ireland and internationally. I agree with the submissions made by organisations such as Christian Aid stating the proposals do not go far enough. It was ironic to listen to organisations such as IBEC stating they go too far. It even stated the proposals add to what it calls the growing view that the EU is a hostile environment for multinationals. Seriously, it does not need to worry about that at all. If one were drawing on the subsidiarity argument to give oneself more power to argue that these measures should go further, it would make some sense. That the opposite argument is being made is frightening and regrettable. As Christian Aid has said, it is very difficult to see how these modest proposals will do anything to help developing countries and prevent multinational corporations from shifting their vast profits out of them to avoid paying tax that could be spent on essential services and fulfilling citizens’ rights in those countries. It is a matter of fact that developing countries suffer most as a consequence of corporate tax dodging. Even the IMF has said tax dodging is worth $200 billion annually. This is a staggering figure. This sum could transform the lives of people. What the proposals describe as "country-by-country reporting" really cannot be called that. It is not actually true because they do not cover every country in which a company might operate. Companies with subsidiaries outside the European Union and those on the list of tax jurisdictions yet to be defined as non-co-operative, namely, the tax havens, will be required only to report on an aggregate basis. That is a fundamental flaw or weakness in the proposal. Placing together jurisdictions to where the profit is likely to be shifted, particularly developing countries and so on, negates the entire point of country-by-country reporting. The policy should have been to shed light on these issues. However, if aggregate reporting is allowed, no light is shed on them. Another key flaw is that the threshold of reporting is set at €750 million. This is way too high and really means that approximately 90% of multinationals will be excluded from the proposal in any case. Therefore, it is an incredibly modest proposal. There are problems with it in that it does not have the ability to deliver sufficient tax transparency or combat the tax dodging that is crucifying developing countries. The contributions from the Government today seem to indicate it is bending the knee to those who would like to see a pretty precarious or dodgy tax-havenish status continue. PricewaterhouseCoopers was very interesting when it referred to the need for enterprises to consider carefully their response to future transparency, particularly country-by-country reporting and the way it reflects on the allocation of results across the value chain. No doubt, PricewaterhouseCoopers will be available to advise. When we talk about tax avoidance in Ireland, we tend to focus on multinational corporations. I acknowledge the disgusting role of organisations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, EY and Deloitte, which operate on the basis of being one step ahead in facilitating the multinationals in avoiding tax at every turn. Their large headquarters are here not because they like the weather or because they are doing the accounts for the newsagent but because they want to facilitate the continuance of what has prevailed here. It is disgusting. To try to make us special in Europe for these reasons is abhorrent when we do not achieve this by being best-case advocates for refugees, for example.

I compliment the special committee that brought this matter to our attention. Deputy Boyd Barrett said this was to go through without any debate. It is always important that we have a debate, no matter what our views are. It is important that we do not pass these measures without debate. I compliment the committee on not rolling over and accepting what was proposed in this instance. As with previous speakers, I believe this is too serious an issue. Many of our indigenous companies are now multinationals. Included in this regard are Kerry Group, Glanbia and numerous others, which are employing thousands of people. All the time, we must be mindful of where they started. They started small. Tosach maith, leath na hoibre. Many of these companies are flagship companies, including in our agrifood industry. In this case, there should be total transparency with regard to accounting and accounting methods of all these companies. I hasten to add, however, that we should not throw the baby out with the bath water. In Clonmel in my constituency and Dungarvan in the neighbouring constituency, there has been considerable foreign direct investment. Multinationals are providing considerable employment and supporting ancillary services and the service industry. These multinationals are huge and many have been here for decades. Predecessors of mine and others, including officials in the county councils, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, worked very hard to bring them here. We must have a reasonable, reflective and balanced debate because we do not want to hunt all the companies out of our country. If we are all poor, we will be limited afterwards, having closed the door when the horse has bolted. The committee has discussed this. It is reflective of the new circumstances in the Dáil that it has agreed not to accept the diktat from the euro-giants. It is important that we show our independence and sovereignty and tell them we are not ready all the time just to rubber-stamp what they want, sometimes in the form of statutory instruments related to much of the legislation coming here from Europe. People are concerned. Perhaps this is why Brexit will occur. Perhaps people in the UK will prove to have wanted to shake off the shackles associated with draconian legislation that is not properly researched or thought through, and without impact assessments on the effects on countries such as Ireland, an island nation on the periphery. Certain other countries are clever in how they proceed in terms of tax transparency. They might have the very same or a better regime of taxation to attract multinationals from abroad. They might not be as transparent in terms of how they account for that or how they cover it in their taxation system or circulate the information. I, too, have concerns about the big companies. Deputy Clare Daly mentioned the big accounting companies. We see day in, day out how they operate in this country. They do not work solely for the multinationals. They are involved in receiverships and insolvency cases of any reasonable size. In more than 90% of cases, they are wheeled out. The same golden circle seems to get all the business. It is not a very nice business and can be very unpleasant but the companies are a dab hand at it. They are wheeled out and appointed by the courts, banks and everybody else to take on the business. We found in some cases that the companies acted as advisers to some of the banks that went bust. We definitely need to have a proper and reasoned debate on all these issues. It is important that we debate this important topic this evening, albeit for a short period. I thank the committee for debating the proposal and not just rubber-stamping it and saying, "Grand, it is all okay".

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	369	I thank the House for allowing me to speak. I will be very brief. Like every other Member of this House, I thoroughly support the presence of multinationals and their contribution to this economy, particularly through the provision of employment. It has now become unfashionable to take on multinationals or challenge them in any way in this country because they are so powerful and because we depend on them.They did very well during the economic boom. My support for the low corporation tax rate and the continued presence of multinational companies in this country is second to none. Notwithstanding this, many Deputies have made a very good case for examining the activities of multinational companies, particularly the tax treatment they receive. It is utterly wrong that anyone in the House would try to brush this subject under the carpet. I agree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett that this subject is almost taboo and free from examination because people are frightened of examining the activities of multinationals or pointing out that certain activity would not be tolerated if an Irish company engaged in it. There is evidence to support that view. For example, I am not aware of any challenge by the Revenue Commissioners to the tax treatment of any multinational company. Native companies have been treated differently, however. It makes me uneasy that we should even contemplate allowing this motion through the House without a debate because it is a very important issue.  There are straws in the wind about multinational companies which would make anybody uncomfortable. One of these is the mystery surrounding the taxation they are paying. There must be a suspicion that they are creating their own tax and deciding what tax they pay. This is done, as everybody knows, through a simple operation by which they charge certain amounts against their profits for intellectual property, thereby allowing themselves to declare and pay the sort of tax they wish to pay. These amounts are phenomenally small in terms of what the companies in question are turning over and their activities here. One need only consider the taxation figures for the end of last year. From memory, Exchequer revenue was boosted but the figures were utterly inexplicable and no one has been able to explain them. The explanation is clear to me and anybody who is honest about this issue. This was money paid into the Exchequer by multinational companies.

It is difficult to debate this in the sort of mature way everybody has, particularly because of the history this particular measure has. However, I think we are saying that today it is more about criminal gangs than about paramilitaries. It may be born in paramilitary traditions and lore, and it was necessary in those days, but it is now equally necessary in order to tackle the criminal gangs that are threatening our society. I said this yesterday, but it is important to underline it. Are we really expected to afford to those who murder and maim the sorts of democratic luxuries they cannot give to anybody else? It is an obscenity that they should be free and able to intimidate not just witnesses, but also jurors. It is simply and utterly wrong. It would be asking far too much of the victims, including the innocent people who have been murdered, the families of the victims and the communities who are threatened if we were to say, "Don't worry; we have some sort of extraordinary liberal democracy here which applies to ordinary citizens, but which we allow to be exploited by people who have no respect for those sorts of democratic values." I long for the day that everybody would be given absolutely equal treatment in the courts. However, that cannot be done for people who do not accept those types of democratic values that the 99% of the population now accept. While I realise it is difficult to introduce measures of this sort and to repeat them every year, I welcome that the Government has this year decided for the first time not to guillotine a measure of this sort to allow a mature and sensible debate and to put it through even in the face of those difficulties.

Other than the Minister, I am probably the only one who has read the report which supposedly authorises us to renew the removal of rights from people who are accused. The Minister who spoke just before me said that we should not grant the same rights to those who are accused. They are but accused; they are innocent until found guilty in a court of law. So they all should have the same rights as those who are innocent, those who are victims. We are discussing two motions, something the last Minister did not have a clue about. There are two measures, one to deal with the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the other relates to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. I have read the reports because I am concerned, as everybody in this House should be, over the continuing renewal of measures that are supposed to address an emergency situation. What we are seeing is normalisation because these measures have been in place since 1998 or 1999 in the case of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 changes, and later in terms of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.They are rubber-stamped every single year. The Minister, Deputy Ross, was also wrong when he said there is no guillotine on these measures. There is a guillotine, in fact, because they have to be passed by a certain date. They are introduced here at the last minute. The reports on the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which extend to no more than four or five flimsy pages, are not circulated to Deputies. If a Deputy wants the reports, he or she has to go to the bother of contacting the Oireachtas Library, which will e-mail them to him or her, thankfully. In the past, Deputies had to find the reports for the current year and for each previous year. In recent years, the reports have outlined how these provisions have been used or abused. The vast majority of them are not used at all, which suggests that the Garda Síochána cannot use them, never mind all the existing laws it could apply to its work. I looked properly at this issue when I was my party's spokesperson on justice. I found that most of these provisions, if they were used at all, were used for trawling purposes only. In fact, no convictions led from most of these provisions. Section 5 has been repealed. Section 6 has not been used at all. Section 7 has been used twice. Section 8 has been used once. Section 12 should be repealed because it has never been used. I think section 17 has been used twice in the almost 17 years for which the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 has been in operation. I come from and represent an area that has borne the brunt of major criminal activity in recent years. I am not saying the State should be weak on crime in any way. Like many others in the justice field, I do not believe we should suspend the right to a jury trial. We should not suspend one's right to have evidence produced to one or to one's defence team while one is in court, so that one can defend oneself. I believe juries can be protected. Many changes can be made to protect juries if there is evidence of intimidation. That does not happen, however, and it has not happened to any major extent in any of these cases. More needs to be done to protect witnesses. I have joined many victims' groups in calling for greater protection to be offered to victims of crime who are intimidated. Criminal gangs in my area have targeted victims. The job of the Garda Síochána is to protect such people. It cannot do that job unless it has the protections and resources to enable it to do so. We will not contribute to that by closing Garda stations and reducing garda numbers. We do not need new laws for the Criminal Assets Bureau. If the existing laws, such as the proceeds of crime laws, were properly implemented, they would help crime fighters as they deal with the crimes we are discussing. The civilianisation of Garda stations would also be of assistance in this regard. We do not live in an emergency situation and we have not done so for many decades.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	383	I am grateful to the House for its consideration today and yesterday of the proposed renewal of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions on both motions. I welcome in particular the speeches in support of the renewal of these provisions in the law. As I listened to those who spoke during the debate yesterday and again this evening, it struck me that there is a shared commitment to ensuring the Garda and the courts are able to deal appropriately with the most serious offences that may threaten the State and the operation of the criminal justice system. Genuinely held concerns were expressed about the robust nature of these provisions. In particular, a number of Deputies expressed their opposition to the continued existence and use of the Special Criminal Court and these provisions. I have to respond to those Deputies by saying I respectfully disagree with them. Are we to accept that there is not a real and persistent threat on this island from republican paramilitary groups, the only agenda of which is murder and mayhem in complete defiance of democracy and human rights? Are we to accept in light of recent events in Dublin that we are not continuing to face a serious threat from gangs of ruthless criminals who have complete disregard for the law and absolutely no hesitation in using extreme violence? Are we simply to ignore these realities while choosing not to retain at our disposal the best means of supporting the gardaí and the courts in tackling these issues? This Government cannot and will not do that. The provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 form the main body of the State's laws to counter subversive activity and terrorism. They complement the general criminal law. While they are out of the ordinary course, they are not emergency laws in the way that many people have tried to depict them. Over the course of the history of the State, especially during the Troubles on this island, these laws and the Special Criminal Court served to protect and safeguard the State from determined efforts to undermine it and its democratic institutions. It is surely beyond reasonable argument that a democratic State is entitled to and must take the measures it considers necessary to protect itself and its people, to ensure the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms and to allow civil society to flourish. With regard to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, many Deputies will be aware from their own experiences as public representatives of the devastation caused by organised crime activities. The drugs trade, in particular, can wreck individual lives and communities. We must continue to meet this challenge head-on by providing the necessary resources and legislative supports to the gardaí and the courts to combat those who seek to undermine the law and to damage lives and communities in the process. We must also ensure a cross-sectoral approach, taking in housing, education, welfare, employment and other services, is part of the solution to the problem of organised crime. In taking legislative measures, we have to strike a balance between what is necessary and what is reasonable. It is not always an easy balance to strike, but I believe these measures achieve that balance. I emphasise that these provisions do not operate in isolation from the rest of the criminal law and the range of protections available in the criminal process for people who are charged with serious offences. Time and again, our independent and impartial Judiciary has proved itself as a guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizen. The provisions of the Offences against the State Acts and the Special Criminal Court have faced many challenges in the Supreme Court and at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. They have largely withstood those challenges. We should not ignore the key role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this process, a role that is carried out independently in full accordance with the law. Some concerns were expressed about the process for the renewal of these provisions. Regardless of the ideal way to do this - that could be the subject of a genuine discussion - the current arrangements place the legislators in control. Members here and in the Seanad have the final say. This is the democratic way and I believe it has much to recommend it. These Acts give the gardaí particular powers in relation to very serious criminal conduct. It seems to make no sense to call for additional Garda resources, which are being provided by the way, while in the same breath demanding the withdrawal of basic powers to fight the most serious crimes. The Garda deploys considerable operational resources to tackle terrorism and organised crime. As legislators, we must give the Garda and the courts the necessary means to bring terrorists and serious criminals to justice. I have no hesitation in agreeing that if circumstances were otherwise, laws such as these would not be needed. However, the stark reality is that until conditions allow, these provisions are a necessary addition to the general criminal law. I commend the motions to the House.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23103	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	387	I move the following Revised Estimate:
Vote 26 — Education and Skills (Revised)
 That a sum not exceeding €8,204,653,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2016, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education and Skills, for certain services administered by that Office, and for the payments of certain grants.It is an honour to present this Revised Estimate to the House. In normal times there would be a much more detailed debate at the education committee, allowing us to go through it line by line. Hopefully, we will be able to do that in the future. We are embarking on a period when budget formation will be much more of a collective endeavour with not just the Government deciding alone on it but with the participation of committees in defining priorities and the issues which need to be addressed. In that context, I am keen the Department of Education and Skills will work with the education committee. I welcome the appointment of Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin as chairman of the committee and look forward to working with it to ensure we have a good report of impacts, outcomes and the way moneys are spent. We will endeavour to improve the information made available to Deputies in order that they can better inform debates. I am convinced education is crucial to our national ambition, whether it is in enterprise, a sector in which I was involved previously, in public service, community, cultural or sporting affairs. It all makes its way back to the nurturing that people get through their education years. It is a great opportunity for us to be seeking to shape and guide policy over the coming years. I have determined we will produce an education strategy statement for the next three years by 1 September. This will set out the direction and goals. I want to work in the same way that I did when I was the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, namely working with Deputies, colleagues and other wider stakeholders to look at progress we make each year and how we can better improve the impact of measures we are taking. I have identified three core areas, reflecting the Government's theme which is to use our economic success to make life better for people. My challenge is to use our economic success to make it easier for learners and for their parents and guardians who support them. There are over 1 million full-time and 250,000 part-time learners. This is a significant number of people whose lives we can improve if we can make changes in the way the education system works. That is an ambition. On top of that, there are areas of disadvantage and we are reviewing the scheme for schools in areas of disadvantage. We are also examining special educational needs provision to ensure we support the full participation of children with special needs. I was pleased that I was able to gain Cabinet approval this week for the appointment of 860 special needs assistants, SNAs, to take up their posts in September. They will complement the 600 extra resource teachers who will also be taking up their places in September. It is good to see children with special educational needs having a much more tailored response to their needs as a result of the additional personnel we are putting into the field. The second big theme is how we support schools to improve continually what they do. There are some fantastically well-led schools doing really interesting work. In these schools, leadership is clear, the quality of teaching methodologies is good and they have the capacity to anticipate change and be innovative. These have to be valued. In this year's Estimates, there is an investment in improving school leadership. We need to build on that. One of the themes in the programme for Government is the concept of an excellence fund which would allow schools to be more innovative and to look at initiatives to improve their environment. It brings in a whole range of issues because those schools have to be able to bring their parents with them, helping them understand their plans and how they will be executed. That is a really good development upon which I want to build. The third theme I have identified is how we build a stronger bridge between education and the workplace, be it a workplace in the public service, the community sector or in the enterprise sector. Significant benefits are to be gained if we can strengthen that bridge. Traditionally, Irish enterprise has not had the tradition of apprenticeships or traineeships which one would find in some other European countries which are exemplars of strong practice. Correspondingly, our education system has not had the privilege of enough placements of their students in a real working environment or being able to share curriculum development with the workplace. There is a win-win if we build a stronger bridge in this regard. This is one area which we will be hoping to develop through regional networks. I know Deputy Cullinane is interested in the regional aspect of this. We have the regional education structure through the education and training boards, which will be significant players in making this happen. I thank my officials for providing the House with a rundown of the budget. It is a different type of debate than we would usually have. There is €8.1 billion on the current side and €600 million on the capital side, with an additional €362 million coming in from the training fund. In gross terms, it represents 17% of total Government spending on the current side and 15% on the capital side. First and second level education gets the lion's share, with 77% of our current spend. Skills is relatively small at 4% of spend, a signal of the need for improvement in this sphere. Higher education gets 19% of current spend. The other large number in the budget is the 80% of our current spend on the pay side. This goes to employ close to 101,000 people in our schools and colleges who provide the underpinning of the education system. I am glad to pay tribute to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, my predecessor, who initiated much good work in the Department’s budget. Specifically in this year's budget, she included several improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio both at primary and secondary level. She also made provision for leadership in the school system with 250 posts freed up to allow people to devote themselves to school leadership, which is an important element as we try to implement education plans. In total, 2,250 additional teachers are being employed this September compared with last year. This is along with the SNAs coming into place. There is a growing importance of special education in our system. We are now spending €1 billion on special education and I am keen to get the best impact from that. There are improvements proposed in this area in the way we utilise it in the schools to get the best impact for children with special educational needs. The other area which we obviously have to pay heed to is the further and higher education sphere. I will be coming to the House soon with a report drawn up by Peter Cassells, highlighting the challenges presented to the higher education funding model we have. It is certainly different from the primary or secondary levels in that it does not have the same connection through pupil-teacher ratios, capitation payments or allocation of school investment which has prevailed in the primary and secondary area.It is a tribute to our higher education system how it has, over the very difficult last few years, significantly enhanced the number of participants involved, even though it did so against a declining resource. Much like the health service, it has had to work in an area where it was necessary to do more with less. As we look to the future, I believe that, collectively, as a Dáil, we have to look to how we create a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector into the next decade and beyond. The other area close to my heart is that of the further education sector. For many years, this has been a sector where perhaps we did not focus enough on quality apprenticeships linked to sustainable sectors. Apprenticeships were dominated by the construction sector which, as we all know, overheated, leading to the collapse of apprenticeships. It is good to see they are coming back but it is much more important that we also see the growth of new apprenticeships. The Department has set the objective of doubling the number of apprenticeships but also seeing 100 new areas of apprenticeship come on stream over a number of years. The first 25 have been identified and work is being put in place to develop those programmes. We need to develop a much stronger skills base. Over time, we need to see this channel gain the same sort of prestige and reputation it has in other European countries, where many people opt for an apprenticeship for the quality of the technical skills it gives them and also the avenues it leads them into, for example, into degree courses, if they so choose, or other fields of endeavour such as setting up a business. We have not had that quality channel in the past. With the revival that we now see of Irish manufacturing and with its great regional spread, there is a real opportunity for us to capitalise on that. I was very pleased today to announce 5,700 places on Springboard, which is a very good programme that, again, was born out of the necessity of the recession. It is targeted at people who have been unemployed and need to make a career. It was inspiring today to see two stories, the first of a mother who had dropped out of the workforce and decided that her previous skills as she re-entered were not sufficient. She chose to study data analytics, a very different environment, and she has thrived and gone on to work in the Revenue Commissioners. The second story was that of a chef who had gone to Australia and then come back. He was unemployed and wanted to get away from work as a chef. He moved into the IT sector and now has an excellent job with General Motors. Those are the sorts of stories that tell the impact of programmes like Springboard but they are also very interesting in the way they incentivise our education system to build links with enterprise. Under Springboard, the vast majority of participants have had work placements. Employers have shared in the shaping of the curriculum and, as a result, the placement rate has been extremely high at 75%. It is a model of what can be done and shows we need to build further upon it. The other big theme is obviously the capital projects, which have a budget of €600 million. To judge from discussions with Deputies around Leinster House, it is probably the biggest element of interest with them. At present, there are 116 major projects either under construction or progressing to commence construction in 2016, which is a very important element. I know it will be of interest to Deputy Cullinane that there is an allocation of €21.5 million to the higher education sector, most of which will be spent on existing commitments such as the Glucksman Library at the University of Limerick and the Carriganore campus at Waterford Institute of Technology, as well as on expenditure in respect of Grangegorman. I would like to thank Deputies for participating. I look forward to an engagement, not just today, but during as many years as are given to us - who knows how long at this stage? This Dáil has offered us an exciting opportunity to shape collectively the future of our education system for the next three years but also beyond that in terms of funding models that can sustain us into the longer-term future. I look forward to working with the committee, Opposition spokespersons and the wider range of Deputies, who have keen experience and can bring a lot to this debate, whether as former teachers or users of the education system. One of the things that has struck me about education is how many more stakeholders have become actively involved in seeking to shape education policy. It is a very policy-rich environment and, together, we need to make the best of the resources that, thankfully, we are seeing more of. As I said at the outset, the ambition is to use our economic success to help shape a future for young people in particular. Nowhere more than in education can we build the link between a strong economy and a fair society. I believe we can bridge those two very successfully through the models of education we develop and I look forward to doing that.

It is more than just an engagement between Government and Opposition. It is an important constitutional function of the Minister and the Government to present the Revised Estimate to the Dáil and for the Dáil to consider it, as we are doing. It is very important that we take this role seriously, particularly in a case where a Government does not have a majority. Many items in this Revised Estimate are welcome. We support and want to see a reduction in class sizes, which, as the Minister said, is a huge priority of everybody, including the Fianna Fáil Party. Indeed, it is one of the items in the education sector which is referenced in the supply and confidence arrangement that we have with the Government party, Fine Gael. It is very important that, while progress is being made on that, further progress needs to be made. Reducing class sizes has to happen at a serious rate in the coming years and it must be possible to reach an average class size of 23 pupils at primary level in the next five years, within our budgetary parameters.  There is also the issue of the staffing ratio in small schools. While the recent changes, which were a row-back on what was done in 2011-12, are welcome, we must put small schools on a firm footing. A simple commitment of the programme for Government to say they will not go without the parents' say-so is not enough. There must be a financial commitment from Government to the small schools and the rural communities of this country. We welcome the increase in the special education budget, in particular for SNAs. However, there is a huge amount of catch-up to be done. The real test will come if the Minister is proven right on this. He is saying there is now a sufficient number of SNAs to meet the assessed need but that will obviously be in the eyes of the beholder. We will be interested to hear from schools and parents, in particular, as to how their assessments went and whether their children will have the benefit of an SNA, as required. We will have to withhold judgment on whether there are enough SNAs until we get feedback but I can say with certainly that some are already saying they are not satisfied with the allocations. The Estimate allocates funding to new policy developments in regard to junior certificate reform, which is very important. It is a fact, however, that the Minister has not yet met the ASTI - in fact, I understand he has not met any of the teaching unions at this stage. I do not know why that would be the case, except that there are holdouts in the ASTI on a number of issues, one of which is junior certificate reform. This is something that does not just require funding; it urgently requires the Department and the Minister to make sure there are no children left at a disadvantage because of the impasse in regard to the reforms in certain schools. That has to happen and it is no use telling the Dáil there is extra money for this when, in fact, in some schools, teachers will refuse to implement it because of an industrial relations dispute. It requires a degree of urgency and I am disappointed, whoever is at fault. While I will not attribute the entire blame to the Minister, it is a fact that he and the ASTI have not met. I urge both sides to agree to meet without conditions to deal with that issue and to get this sword of Damocles, which will be hanging over certain students for the next few years, withdrawn.The Minister and the ASTI have a responsibility in this regard. This must be dealt with and it can be dealt with through talking, most importantly, or at least trying to talk which at the moment does not even seem to have occurred. There is extra funding for ICT which is welcome. We need to continue the roll-out of broadband to all schools. We will always have problems with this, and I will alert the Department to those of which I am aware. Maintenance funding needs to be put on a more predictable basis by the Department because it is a key issue for schools with regard to how they maintain and update. An issue which has been brought to my attention by senior trade unionists is that in the Revised Estimates €2 million has been put forward to assist the development of technological universities. In tandem with this, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has announced, certainly in the case of the Munster technological university, an allocation of €1.2 million in funding to support the project announced-----

He may have got it wrong, but I am reading directly from a letter. The last time I checked no legislation had been passed by the House on technological universities, but the Minister is spending money on this and the HEA is announcing funding for the project. We have not passed the legislation and the Dáil has not decided to proceed in that direction. I would have thought this was premature and there needs to be more reflection on the Technological Universities Bill. In fact, it needs to be passed if it is to proceed and it has not yet done so. The Minister has announced he wants it to proceed, but as of yet he has not brought it before the House. It has been reinstated on the Order Paper but I have not been informed of any date on which the remaining Stages of the legislation have been scheduled. Why is this money being spent when the Dáil has not established it? To me, this is something the Minister would have railed about in the past in his successful role as Opposition finance spokesperson with regard to spending money. I would not have thought money could be spent on items which have not been passed by the House. This is something that has been brought to my attention recently. I will certainly look into it a bit more and I would like the Minister's explanation. It is certainly not within his remit to anticipate any decision the Dáil might or might not take on the Technological Universities Bill. Our priority with regard to technological universities, if they are to exist, and with regard to the third level sector, is that access is as convenient as possible for students and to ensure in all of this that nobody will end up being disadvantaged with regard to access not only to institutions but also to subjects within institutions. The whole point of the regional college structure as it was established and then turned into institutions of technology was to make further education accessible to provincial communities and the outlying parts of the greater Dublin area. We do not want to see any reduction in this but we question money being spent on something that is not law and has not been agreed as of yet. The schools capital plan is always launched with huge fanfare. I suppose every Government is guilty of this, but the previous Government became specialists in pre-announcing projects which were many years away. Capital expenditure will only return to pre-2011 levels by 2019. In recent years, the Government may well have been getting better value for money as prices decreased, but construction inflation is probably increasing. We need more investment in this as there are problems with schools. There are many schools on the list but, in reality, under current financial levels they have no prospect of getting the go-ahead for their projects. In some cases it is in the realm of fantasy this will happen unless the budget is increased substantially. The Minister's officials warned him about this in very stark terms in the briefing note they gave him on his assumption to office. The Minister highlighted a number of projects that will be supported by the third level capital budget, but the reality is they are pretty much the only third level projects that will be supported. Deputy Cullinane will certainly be happy with the work taking place at Waterford Institute of Technology. Mention was also made of works at University of Limerick and Grangegorman, but there is very little else. This is of concern because we need capacity. Numbers in the third level sector are increasing and it needs capacity. There is virtually no State investment in buildings or research facilities and this has been the case since 2008. Approximately 40% of the higher education system's infrastructure is below standard and this will have to be seriously addressed in the near future or we will not be able to compete. The standard of our educational facilities is a key driver of the outcomes of our third level education system. They are attractive places to do research, study or gain qualifications and they are attractive for students coming from abroad, and we will lose out if funding is not available for them. We will not oppose the Estimate or quibble about it too much. We need the money that is being spent. However, the Minister will have to fight very hard to ensure schools stay open and the threat outlined by his officials in the briefing note does not come to fruition. He must ensure the capitation rate is increased and there is sufficient money for capital spending. He will have to announce his proposals shortly with regard to reinstating the guidance counselling service, as discussed and as referred to in the supply and confidence agreement, and with regard to postgraduate grants. I look forward to hearing the Minister's proposals on these items and, possibly, Revised Estimates and Estimates for next year. We want to see some action on them because they are very important as I have outlined. We must systematically prioritise investment in our education system. I know the Minister agrees with this, but we need to see action on it. We have a sustained record in education of delivering for society. It is not just about the economy, important though that is. We have a well-rounded society, by and large, through opening people's minds through teaching them and then developing our economy through the research done here with the availability of highly educated graduates. It must be a top priority for the Government and for the Minister to ensure the necessary funding is delivered.

Our education system has been absolutely ravaged by the austerity measures introduced by Fianna Fáil and pursued by the previous Government. The reality is our children are being taught in overcrowded classrooms. Crowd control has become a dominant feature in too many classrooms throughout the State. Principals are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the costs of running schools and the capitation grant must be increased. Basic costs such as providing heat and lighting are proving difficult and many schools rely on voluntary contributions from hard-pressed families, which is not good enough. We need change in this regard. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds have been impacted directly and indirectly through a combination of cutbacks and policy decisions, which have shifted the burden of the costs of education onto students and their families. Despite all the spin, there is no new money here. These are the Estimates that were published six months ago and it is important that we clarify this at the outset. I will outline my concerns about a number of specific measures as outlined in the Revised Estimates. The issue of school transport is very topical at present as parents and children are making preparations for another school year. It states in the Revised Estimates that the target for this year is to provide school transport for 111,000 students. However, this is a decrease of 2,000 students from the 113,000 students who availed of school transport last year. I am puzzled as to how the Minister proposes to reduce this number in light of the increasing enrolments throughout the country. I notice also that no additional funding has been allocated to the school transport service despite increasing demographic pressures. I sincerely hope the Minister will hold true to his word on this issue and there will be no cuts in school transport, particularly in rural areas where there are no transport systems.I welcome any clarification that the Minister can offer in this regard. Class sizes in Ireland remain the second highest in Europe, with almost one in four pupils in mainstream classes being taught in classes of 30 or more, and this is totally unacceptable. That is 129,428 pupils, an increase of more than 30,000 pupils since 2010. In my constituency of Offaly and north Tipperary, 21% of our children are being taught in classrooms of 30 pupils or more. I welcome the Government's target to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 27:1 in 2016. However, this must become action and cannot be just rhetoric and spin. There is no mention of any plans to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in DEIS schools, nor is there any plan to address the issue of oversized classrooms, and this is a bitter disappointment. At secondary level those from disadvantaged backgrounds are at a huge disadvantage due to the ill-thought-out and misguided cut to guidance counsellors, which has proved to be detrimental. A recent ESRI report stated clearly that those from poorer backgrounds were affected most by this cut. It was short-sighted, unfair and totally unnecessary. Sinn Féin has shown how, through progressive and fair taxation measures, it is possible to have a fairer and more equal society, and in our manifesto we allowed for the full restoration of guidance counsellors, that is, the provision of a guidance counsellor for every 500 pupils ex quota. There is no justification for the Minister not to reverse this cut immediately. A number of issues regarding third-level and higher education are of great concern to me and my party. The €2 million provided for the establishment of the technological universities is woefully inadequate and does not take into account the complex nature of the merger process and the many other issues. It is important that the Minister understand that, if this project is to be successful, sufficient funding must be allocated to it. It is an issue of huge concern to all stakeholders. I have heard that figures of up to €45 million are required to ensure that the implementation of technological universities is in place, and I am disappointed that the Minister has not allocated sufficient resources to this. I am also concerned about the €2 million decrease in funding for the provision of school support and related expenses compared with 2015. This contradicts the Minister's assertions that additional funding will be provided for students from disadvantaged backgrounds under the student assistance fund. I welcome the increase in funding to SOLAS in order to provide further education and training activities. However, given the ambitious targets to ensure the increase in the number of apprenticeship places to 50,000, it would appear that this funding will fall far short of what is required. I heartily welcome the announcement of the provision of additional special needs assistants. However, the Minister needs to be clear here. This is not new money, despite the spin that we have heard during the week. As a teacher with over 12 years' experience in the classroom and somebody who has worked with special needs pupils, I am passionate about this issue, and it is of great concern to many teachers and parents. One of the cruellest cuts made by the last Government was the 15% cut in resource hours for children with special educational needs. This Government has not made any commitment to reverse this cut, and I find this unacceptable and disappointing. In our manifesto Sinn Féin prioritised the provision of supports for children with special educational needs and we clearly showed how it was possible to reverse these cuts and to provide additional resources to vulnerable children. Education is a fundamental human right and should be available to all of our children, irrespective of their class or individual circumstances. Yet 12 years after it was enacted, the EPSEN Act 2004 still has not been implemented, including parts of it which would be very simple to implement, such as the planning for individual education plans, IEPs, for children with special needs. When I have asked why this Act is not being implemented on a statutory basis I have been told that it would cost too much. Why is the Minister happy to turn around to the parents of a child with a disability and tell them that the Government of one of the richest countries in the world cannot afford the resources their child needs to access education on an equal footing to his or her peers? Why is he happy to introduce tax cuts to the benefit of the very top earners in this country while our children are being taught in overcrowded classrooms? Why is he happy to take €4 billion out of the State coffers while our schools are struggling to keep the lighting and heating on? Our education system badly needs investment and resources. It needs vision and new thinking but that is not what has been delivered. This Government is simply continuing where the last one left off, prioritising tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of our public services. This is not new politics, it is just more of the same, and it is not good enough for our children.

It is the first time I have addressed him in this Chamber, and I have worked very well with him in his previous incarnation as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I find myself agreeing with much of what he said in his speech. The problem is that the rhetoric in the speech does not match the output in terms of the outgoing Government's performance in respect of education. He said at the start that education is crucial to our ambition, and I agree with that, but the height of my ambition is obviously a bit different to this Government's ambition when it comes to education. Ambition must be matched with intent and resources and we must invest in education, nurture it and make sure that we value not just the education system but also the people who work in it. When one considers how teachers have been treated, particularly newly qualified teachers, and pay cuts and so on, that does not stack up. Many students are in poverty or living on the poverty line; many more cannot afford to go to third or fourth level. Many parents cannot afford to send their children to college and struggle to pay for their children's primary and secondary education because of rising costs. That is the reality for many families so, unfortunately, the ambition that the Government has and its rhetoric has not been matched with resources. Regarding the Minister's three priorities, again I find myself agreeing with what he says. The first one, if I understood the Minister correctly, was the use of success to make life better. How does that sit with the treatment of teachers who came into the system in 2011, where we have a two-tier, unequal pay structure? I believe in the principle of equal pay for equal work, and I ask the Minister to give a commitment that this Government will deal with this issue once and for all. I have tabled umpteen parliamentary questions on this and have met with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to cost going back to a single-tier pay structure, to deal with that inequality. They tell me that they cannot cost it because they do not have the data, and it seems to be excuse after excuse. This is a red line issue for me. It is a red line issue for any pay negotiations and for how we treat people, on the basis of equality, and it should be a red line issue for the Minister if he is committed to using our economic success to make life better. The second priority is how we support schools and the education system. We do not support it by cutting funding. Capital expenditure in education is down 11% year-on-year. The Government has cut expenditure and capital services in education by more than €71 million. Capital investment in education is down by €22.6 million alone. Overall we have the third lowest level of capital investment to GDP in the European Union. It is less than 2% of GDP. It should be at least double that if we are to bring ourselves to the EU average. The European Commission has criticised the Government for prioritising tax cuts over investment and we can see these in the Estimates. We can see them in the Minister's stability programme update report, which shows that the percentage of revenue and of expenditure year-on-year for the next number of years as a percentage of GDP goes down every year, not because we do not have increased fiscal space, but because it builds in the tax cuts that the Government will impose, as opposed to spending the money that is there to invest in children, public services like education and capital investment. The Minister's third priority was a question. He asked how we can build a bridge between enterprise and the workplace in an educational context.I hope the Minister does not take what some might describe as a neoliberal approach to education whereby education is just about meeting the needs of enterprise and the economy. There is a society out there, not just an economy. An economy exists to serve citizens. People go to school and college for a job but also for lifelong learning and to improve their well-being. I am not against fostering innovation and creativity; I believe in it and passionately support it. However, we should not view this through the prism of a neoliberal mindset, which some Government Ministers do. The Minister's question about the link between enterprise and the workplace is interesting in the context of the technological universities. In this area, I agree with the Minister and the Government. Technological universities should not, in the first instance, ape the existing universities. Their applied orientation, whereby they are more oriented towards the economic needs of a region is good. Given the very high levels of unemployment in the south east, technological universities are a good fit for the region. However, they must be about more than meeting the needs of enterprise. The technological universities must be about creativity and innovation. It is also about linkages with primary and secondary schools and it is a much broader view than just meeting the needs of the economy. I welcome the €1.5 million which has been allocated to help the process in the south east. I welcome the fact that the two presidents and boards of both institutes have welcomed the €1.5 million. Why is there only €2 million? Perhaps, the Minister might respond to it if he gets the chance. Is more money being provided for the other institutes of technology which are also part of merger processes? I thank the Minister for his speech. I am afraid it was high on rhetoric. We must, and will, give the Minister fair wind. I have set out my priorities. If the Minister wants to make a mark in education, while there is much he must do about education itself, I appeal to him to examine pay equalisation. It is causing tensions in classrooms and must be dealt with. It is mentioned in the programme for Government and the Minister has an opportunity to deal with it. I very much hope he does.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	394	I wish the Minister well in his appointment to the education portfolio. He has expressed an interest in becoming Minister for Education and Skills from time to time and I hope that, now that he is Minister, he will enjoy it. It is 100 years since the Easter Rising, and many of the signatories of the Proclamation who were executed after the Rising, from James Connolly to Pádraig Pearse and Thomas MacDonagh, as well as being artists and poets, were teachers. They expressed the most profound interest in education as a way of transforming people's lives in a positive way. Education would be productive from the point of view of Ireland flourishing economically. More important, it would help the whole person, whether boy or girl, to develop in accordance with their ambitions. In Ireland, including my constituency, Dublin West, where there has been an extraordinary population growth, we have been privileged to have patrons, boards of management, teachers, parents and parents associations who, regardless of creed, religion or no religion, have exercised the most incredible spirit of co-operation and dynamism to build and develop a huge number of new schools over the past 20 years. During my participation in politics it has been a tremendous privilege to be part of it. I have a question about the capital programme. We are all aware that the process of forming a Government has been extremely long and, presumably, very detailed. However, I am very concerned that it has meant, in many Government Departments, that the foot has been taken of the pedal regarding driving the capital programme. There are a number of indications that the capital programme has slowed down very significantly this year. I would like the Minister to explain why that is so. Unless there is something he is not telling us, he has additional resources, which were agreed between Fine Gael and the Labour Party at the time of the budget last year. I do not understand what has happened to the capital programme, given the demands of an increasing population, particularly in the growing parts of cities, towns and counties around the country. For example, I had anticipated that around this time, as schools close for the holidays, in Dublin West two schools would be completely rebuilt. One of them is the old parish school of St. Mochta's, which is 150 years old. Some time ago, at the request of the Department of Education and Skills, it increased from two streams to four streams and took, as a consequence, in the public interest, a huge number of prefabs. Now, work that was expected to commence this summer, with the project at stage 2B, has been stalled for the whole period during which the discussions on the formation of a Government were taking place. I do not understand it. When I was Tánaiste, I was very involved in pushing with the then Minister, very successfully, to get the junior and senior primary schools rebuilt in Corduff on the north side of the Navan Road, an area with a very large population. We had an agreement and all of it has been going very well. Again, I expected to the construction start. The school is in an area where many of the parents are not particularly well off. Again, it seems to be stuck in the slow-down of public service development on the capital side during the hiatus of forming a Government. I would like the Minister to tell us about the capital programme and what exactly has happened. Both of the previous speakers mentioned the technological universities. What is happening regarding the Dublin Institute of Technology? The Minister has been a very ambitious driver of job creation and investment into Ireland by companies, including local companies, SMEs and international companies. The stalling of the technological university project is a bad decision for the country as a whole and the areas that have institutes of technology. These are real drivers in a programme for Government that is, apparently, committed to regional development. I speak as somebody who has lectured in the technological sector over a long period of time before I became a public representative. These are real drivers of a range of different kinds of enterprise. A political change happened in the run up to the last general election when people became less convinced about the technological university model.This is wrong because if we want to drive technological university development, the Government needs to put its commitment to action where its rhetoric is and deliver on it. It would be an enormous dereliction to walk back from what has been achieved by the Minister's two predecessors, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and Ruairí Quinn, in respect of developing the technological university sector. I would like to hear the Minister say this is back on the agenda in a way that we will see such development because there is no reason we should not see it. Campus developments have been stalled. I challenge him on when he will publish the Cassells report as a matter of urgency and refer it to the Oireachtas committee on education to allow for a full debate on the current funding model and what some people describe as a "crisis" in higher education and on identifying solutions to that. The all-party committee should offer an open forum for debate on the future of higher education. We have secured one of the great achievements in Europe in respect of the numbers of people participating in third level but we have to invest. Both capital and current investment are critical to this. The Government has to get people in the system to contribute their views on the future strategy. The higher education sector cannot be allowed to drift along without addressing problems of underfunding in the system. The Minister has spoken a great deal about how important the sector is for the future of all our young people and how important its contribution to economic and social progress is. We cannot be misled by simplistic solutions or the temptation to accept without proper debate policies which have been adopted elsewhere. For instance, student loans are often presented as the only solution to financing higher education. Is that the Minister's view? We need to hear it in the context of this Estimates discussion. When students in the US emerge from college at either graduate or postgraduate level, many of them carry a debt burden that lasts for most of the rest of their lives. We need a debate about this. There will be no solution to the plight of the higher education sector without a long-term commitment to greater public investment. Approximately 50% of students get grants, which is a significant achievement of our education system, but there has to be a funding solution that allows higher education institutions to offer the best in class, the best in Europe or the best in the world to be part of their profile and given the commitment to education in Ireland, that is not necessarily difficult to achieve but it will demand a commitment to resources. Whatever happened to the Minister who has always been a great champion of information being available to Members in respect of economics and figures for the various portfolios he has held as spokesperson or the Departments he has led? By mid-morning today, we still did not have a copy of the Revised Estimates.

We should have been able to get these in the middle of March but this was not possible. However, we should then have been able to get them almost immediately following the formation of the Government and yet they were published this morning. I note in the book we were offered that there are only four Votes, which is the first time I have seen this. The Minister can say because he is in government that he is aware that there is no change to the Estimates but nobody has told anybody else that. I refer to the legacy of the previous two Ministers for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and Ruairí Quinn. The huge increase in the recruitment of teachers was most welcome both last year and this year once the financial resources of the State had begun to recover. I listened to the contributions of Sinn Féin Members. The party's education Minister in the North said at a meeting of student teachers that they should not look to him for jobs because they were unable to recruit anybody there. It is a great achievement of the previous Government that there was significant additional recruitment in 2015 and 2016 unlike in the North where current students of education have been told by their Minister that there will not be any jobs. It is important that Members recognise the important achievements that have been secured. What is the agreement with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the capital budget or is it stalled? Could the Minister give us an indication as to when the rebuilding of the two schools I mentioned will commence? In the previous Government, the Labour Party prioritised the development of a new apprenticeship structure with a huge number of apprentices to be recruited. The programme for Government cut the number from the 50,000 proposed by the Labour Party to 31,000. I have never understood the reason for that reduction. How is that progressing given we are more than five months into the financial year? I welcome the commitment to additional SNAs. Will they be recruited within existing resources or are additional resources being provided? I was the first person to propose to the Taoiseach some weeks ago that in respect of the difficulties currently besetting the north inner city in Dublin, a task force should be established and a key element of it should be focused on education. The Minister attended last night's meeting in Sheriff Street with the Taoiseach and I would like him to outline the additional educational resources that will be devoted to that city centre and the north inner city. Dublin West is experiencing an extraordinary coming together of different patrons, faiths and people who to not practise any particular faith in a movement where every child is welcome. I am disturbed by the Minister's comments about his approach to community national schools.I hope I misheard or misread the Minister's intention, namely, that the idea is perhaps to segregate children in regard to different elements of religious or ethical education. That would be a really bad move.

#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	401	I hope we will all get the extra time that Deputy Burton was given. The first line in the briefing we got on the Estimates for education, which is the topic in hand, states that the gross voted expenditure by the Department of Education and Skills for 2016 is in the order of €8.7 billion. If we compare that with the fact that €8.5 billion will be handed over by this State in interest payments on a debt that was not a debt of the making of the majority of ordinary people of this country, it puts things into perspective. Contrary to the former Tánaiste's fairytale speech about protecting education and so on, since 2011, some 11% has been cut from schools but, prior to that, the minute the bailout and the recession hit, schools were the first to pay the price. In Dublin West, which the former Tánaiste mentioned, 100 primary teachers were taken out of schools in Dublin 15 between 2009 and 2010. Some 300 special needs assistants were also taken out of schools. Parents took buses into the city centre and marched in protest at those cuts. The Minister might remember all of that. In 2014, in a memo to the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in the previous Government, civil servants had to warn the Government that any more cuts would force schools to close. This was not the Socialist Party but senior Department officials who warned that any further reduction, if it were necessary for budgetary measures, may create a risk that some schools would not be able to cover critical costs such as insurance, heat and light and that it would trigger school closures. In other words, it is completely unsustainable to leave schools reliant on voluntary payments, about which we have heard much lately, and bereft of so many of the teachers and the resources that were taken out of the system. It is now time to dramatically increase investment in education through, for example, taxation of wealth in this country. The INTO points out that €1 per day is spent per pupil in this country. We have the worst funded second level system in the OECD. While we read in the document that there will be certain improvements, I argue that will be nothing near what is needed to restore what has been taken from schools during the past eight years. There have been substantial cuts since 2008 with some of the main ones including the loss of guidance counsellor provision, the taking of thousands of teachers out of the system, the moratorium on the post of responsibility which has meant that many jobs that used to be done have not been done in schools and the fact that Traveller education was gutted.  I want to focus in my contribution on teachers. Payroll accounts for 80% of the expenditure in the Estimates, most of it being spent on teachers, some of it being spent on special needs assistants and some of it being spent on other jobs within schools. An interesting article on the ASTI website, entitled "Three colleagues, three pay scales", tells the story of three teachers teaching in the same school. There is about a year or two in the age difference among them and they are getting three different levels of pay. That is outrageous. When will this end? The three teachers concerned in Presentation College, Bray, are Michael Berigan who is 31 years of age, Yvonne Rossiter who is 27 years of age and Michael Browne who is also 27 years of age. They teach alongside each other and they graduated within a couple of years of each other. Michael Berigan is on the pre-2011 salary scale, Yvonne Rossiter is on the 2011 new entrant salary scale and Michael Browne is on the 2012 new entrant salary scale. The gap in earnings among them amounts to thousands of euro every year. I ask the Minister tonight when he will end that disgraceful inequality that was forced on many workers, teachers, nurses and other workers in the public service. I have a story to relay from a woman who sent me an e-mail today as she knew this topic would be discussed. She is a primary school teacher living in my constituency. She highlights that she will earn €220,000 less over a 40-year career than her colleagues who graduated prior to 2011. This is very problematic for a number of reasons, and I do not need to tell the Minister those reasons. How is anyone like that woman ever meant to be able to buy a house, or to rent in the current situation where rents in her area have gone up by €341 per month since 2014? She points out how demoralising it is to work side-by-side with other teachers knowing how much more money they are earning compared with her and her lower paid counterparts. We will see another brain drain. There is no doubt that we will see people with those qualifications leaving this country. The previous Government let that happen with the nurses who left and it will happen again with teachers who will leave. They are leaving to go to Dubai and other countries where they will get proper pay and reward for the work they do. I could spend more time speaking on this issue, but the reduced pay and the low hours are driving graduates away from teaching. The TUI president has spoken about this and it is now becoming a reality. The so-called partial restoration we saw in the legislation last year was nowhere near enough. We must have equal pay for equal work. I urge the teachers' unions to challenge this legally. Surely it cannot be right that two people doing the same work can be paid differently. The Minister is standing over this, but the effect of this on people's career earnings, their pensions and so on is incredible. When will the Minister turn his attention to that aspect? We now have a situation where teachers not only spend much of their time being part-time, but they then have the double whammy of the inferior payscale when they do get a permanent contract. The number of part-time teachers in Ireland is twice the OECD average. It is 30% in Ireland; one in three teachers are working part-time and do not have permanency. That must be addressed. I also want to deal with the issue of class sizes. It is pointed out in the document that class sizes will improve by one point. At primary level, there will be one teacher for 27 pupils as opposed to 28 pupils. That is still atrocious. It goes nowhere near restoring what was done in the past few years. There will be 300 extra teachers at second level. There are approximately 750 second level schools in the country so each school can look forward to the addition of less than half a teacher each, as it were. Is this for real? We are meant to be in recovery but we still have the worst funded second level system. I do not think too many bottles of champagne will be cracked open in schools around the country when they hear these figures. The pupil numbers have risen at primary level by more than 10,000 in one year from 2013 to 2014, yet the number of teachers has not followed apace. When will that be remedied?  I did not mention the capital programme and I am surprised at how small a percentage it is of the overall expenditure.If 93% is current expenditure, only €600 million is capital expenditure. This is in the context of the history and legacy we have in Ireland of prefabs and rundown schools. We heard wonderful tales from Deputy Burton about Dublin West but one of the biggest issues there is the fact that we still have massive schools with huge numbers of pupils. I mention St. Mochta's which has poor lighting, an aging building and 900 pupils, half of whom are taught in prefabs. Although it was promised before the election, when Deputies Burton and Varadkar were Ministers, and a host of schools appeared on election literature, will the money be there to build the projects on the schools building programme list last year? I cannot see it. There is no problem getting on a list. It is like getting on a hospital waiting list. However, that does not mean one actually gets the school building. It might have got the Deputies over a hump for the election but will we actually see blocks and bricks at all of the schools that were listed and in respect of which promises were made? I am very doubtful based on €600 million for capital expenditure.

Unfortunately, I did not have sight of this until today. I do not know where the breakdown in communication was. Separately, I note that the print is particularly small. It may be that I need to change my glasses but it is difficult to read it. I will start on a positive note by welcoming the announcement recently on special needs assistants, which is welcome. I welcome the announcements on apprenticeships and on a total of 116 major capital projects. While I welcome all of that, it must be put in context. In the first instance, there should have been no cutbacks in relation to the most vulnerable people in society and those with special needs. That should not have happened. While it is back, I cannot deal with it without understanding its context. Similarly, Deputy Coppinger made the point on capital investment. While I welcome the projects, what is the background? One of the schools in Na Forbacha has been the subject of a campaign for 20 years. When one looks at it in that context, a slightly different picture emerges. What I will do tonight is focus on four areas, including DEIS, school transport, literacy and the division between new entrant teachers and existing ones. DEIS has been suspended from 2009, which was an appalling decision. It is even worse that it has remained suspended right up to 2016. I have asked two parliamentary questions and been told a review is under way. I have been given no timeframe for that review. It is unjustifiable to have a review ongoing for that period of time. At the risk of being parochial, I illustrate the general point by looking at the Merlin Woods national school, which just missed out on inclusion because it applied in 2010. It is a co-educational primary school located on the east side of Galway city. It opened its doors for the first time five years ago in 2010 due to the urgent need for a new school. It is in an area which has high levels of social and economic disadvantage as identified by various research projects, including from NUIG and, indeed, the city council itself. I will not go into those but refer to one paragraph from the research. In that particular school, which does not qualify for DEIS, as it has been suspended, more than 85% of the pupils come from non-English speaking backgrounds. Approximately one quarter of the parents are lone parents and many live in local authority housing. Of the parent body, 75% is unemployed. Some providers in the above-mentioned research indicate that there is a high level of deprivation and social exclusion experienced generally in the area. The principal states "We are a new school, challenged with providing an education to the children of our area without the resources that any other school in similar circumstances has". At present, there are 300 children in the school and that will go up to 450. A whole-school evaluation conducted in 2004 gave superb feedback to the school. The staff, principal and parents are to be congratulated on the wonderful result. However, in black print and highlighted in a detailed letter given to all the candidates in the local election, the principal states "We are at breaking point". The principal appealed to us to get that school into the DEIS scheme but nothing has happened. The Minister may keep his head down and he may be bored by the facts. I do not know. However, I ask him to tell me when DEIS is going to be reinstated. In his Revised Estimates, there is a reference to DEIS and it talks about the improvement in leaving certificate retention rates. For DEIS schools, there was a retention rate in 2013 of 80.1%, which went up to 80.4% in 2014. In 2015, it went up to 82.8%. Many reviews have been referred to and I will go back to them when I move to literacy. They show that there have been improvements as a result of the DEIS scheme. If the Minister is seriously interested in education as indicated by the wonderful words in his opening speech in relation to education and its importance, his acts must speak louder than his words. The OECD programme for international assessment of adult competence, or PIAAC, set out in its 2012 results that one in six people in Ireland is at level 1 literacy. Translated into figures, that is 521,550 Irish adults, more than half a million, who find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult. In plain English, it is very difficult for them to read a bus timetable or medicine instructions. One in four, or 754,000, has difficulties with maths. That is real world maths from basic addition and subtraction to calculating averages. Significantly, the survey also showed that people who scored at the lowest literacy and numeracy levels often have no or low qualifications, earn less income and were unemployed and in poor health. I must say that there is an improvement in the literacy figures because prior to that, it was one in four. I welcome the improvement but we still have that phenomenal figure of 521,550 people who are at the basic level through no fault of their own. We have utterly failed that group of people which is significant and substantial. There are only 55,000 people attending adult literacy services currently. While I welcome the fact they are in the services, they are a tiny proportion of the overall figure. The Minister's own national skills strategy that will take us up to 2025 targets the upskilling of 165,000 people, which is welcome. The target for numeracy is an upskilling of 256,000 people. However, without considerable resources going into that, those targets will not be met. Even if we meet those targets, that still leaves a substantial proportion of the population with unmet needs. That is just level 1. I do not have the time to go into levels 2 or 3 but one can imagine the implications for taking full-time employment and, more importantly, for leading a healthy, wealthy life. If one is at that basic level, there are serious restrictions on one's participation in society at every level. In the Minister's Estimates, there is a serious reduction in the number of students to be provided with school transport services. From what I can see on page 32, it is reduced by 3,000 from 114,000 to 111,000.This figure has been mentioned by a Sinn Féin Deputy. The number of routes will increase, but the overall number of pupils on school transport will decrease significantly. For the life of me, I cannot understand this. I wish to raise a number of points about school transport relating to cases in which people are begging for the service. Galway city has a major traffic congestion problem, yet school transport services are being reduced. According to the bureaucratic speak being sent out in letters, if one is 3.2 km or less from a school, one is not entitled to travel on a bus. That is an arbitrary figure. I have a petition from students at Scoil Bhríde in Shantalla, Galway, who travel farther than 3.2 km but who have been told to attend a DEIS school - it is fortunate to have a DEIS designation - and that they are not entitled to school transport because they come from the Knocknacarra area, where there are other schools, albeit not DEIS ones. The children have no choice but to attend the DEIS school. This type of bureaucratic stuff is Kafkaesque. Similarly, in Claregalway and Headford, families are being split, with one child travelling on a bus in one direction and the parents going by car in another. This situation is being compounded by a plan to reduce school transport further. From the point of view of sustainable transport and reducing traffic congestion in the interests of climate change, I appeal to the Minister on every level to review this situation and listen to the people on the ground, some of whom are willing to pay for concessionary tickets but cannot get any, and others who need that transport. The difference in salary scales for new entrants to the teaching profession has been mentioned by many Deputies. We attended a briefing on this at 5.30 p.m. today. The difference in pay is not justified on any level. No Deputy present - we are all on the same salary, unless we are Ministers - could justify sending his or her children to a school where teachers were on different pay levels based on a decision to effect cutbacks in order to bail out bankrupt banks. In the interests of new politics, it is time to undo the damage that we have done on every level. It is time for payback. I have asked for a review of DEIS schools, but my final point is about a review of literacy and numeracy levels. The review of numeracy was the baseline, as nothing had been done previously. There is an onus on us to monitor literacy and numeracy skills annually so that we might have a baseline from which to determine whether progress is being made.

I look forward to working with him constructively for the betterment of all sectors of education. My questions will be on the renting of prefabs. Between 2011 and 2015, the Department spent €83 million on prefab rental. Although there is a prefab replacement period, only 217 schools qualified: 209 primaries and eight post-primaries. Given the overall number of schools that applied, this is a low qualification level. Learning or teaching in a prefabricated building is difficult, be it in winter or in the hot weather of last week. It is unsatisfactory. Above all, the rent is a major waste of money. It is dead money. Some companies are doing well out of it, but there is no benefit to the educational sector, as prefabs do not last. Scoil Aonghusa in Cashel, Tiobraid Árann, is a wonderful institution. The Minister is familiar with Tipperary for different reasons. He came down there fadó fadó chun bean chéile as Cluain Meala a fháil. I wish them both well. It is good to see them happy. The odd time when the Minister visits Clonmel, maybe he will stop in Cashel at my invitation to visit that wonderful institution. For 12 months, Scoil Aonghusa sought a meeting with the previous Minister concerning severe cuts to necessary services. The school needs a bit of help, understanding and appreciation. Its board and staff would appreciate a visit if the Minister could fit one into his schedule. Gaelscoil Chluain Meala used to be located in an old council building that was closed in 1988. Tá siad ag fanacht ar scoil nua ar feadh deich mbliana nó dhá bhliain déag. There has been a great deal of lobbying. While a site has been acquired, the procurement of which I was involved in with the late Minister, Brian Lenihan, progress on the school building has been very slow. It is a wonderful school with a large enrolment. Ours is one of the only towns in the country that also has a gael meanscoil. This issue must be addressed. To be parochial again, an amalgamation is under way idir scoil na mbuachaillí agus scoil na gcailíní i gCathair Dhún Iascaigh, but it has taken nearly half a century to progress. It has definitely taken a quarter of a century. I hope that, with the Minister's interest in and connections with Tipperary, he might be able to give us a small bit of cabhair leis na rudaí mar sin. On education generally, we have the Estimates and the Minister can prove that a great deal of money has been allocated. I welcome the announcement of extra special needs assistants, SNAs. They are badly needed. I would like to see the roll-out, the figures and the cuts. According to the briefing document, the number of SNAs increased by a few hundred in recent years. I know of nowhere that received extra SNAs, but I know many schools that lost them. As the Minister knows, they are a vital link. I was involved in setting up a naíonra and, while in the VEC, I was involved in adult education. Education is important from the cradle to the grave. We need to invest. Will the Minister consider a loan scheme for third level students? I have people in third level. We hope that they will progress on to work and pay back some of the money. Students' parents are hard pressed, especially those who are ordinary working people who do not avail of grants and are caught in that trap. A cruel issue is the closed school rule. It makes no sense whatsoever. I have seen situations in schools where beirt dhaltaí have a suíochán ar an mbus - they have two seats on the bus - but two other daltaí are starting school this year or next year and cannot get seats on that bus. They are told to go to another school because of a distance that is the same as from here to the front gate of this building. The measurement in kilometres is so tight that it is causing an anomaly. In such cases, common sense should prevail and people should be allowed to go with the rest of their family to the same schools. When a family starts at a school, it should be accommodated by allowing all of its children to attend that school. The Minister has heaps of work to do. The difference in pay scales is crazy. The unions must take some blame for that as well. They pulled up the ladder after getting in. That is typical. I look forward to working with the Minister.

I hope that he will carry his traditional work ethic into this ministerial portfolio. I wish to discuss small schools.Unfortunately, the works programmes for those schools and, indeed, secondary schools were held up because of the delay in the formation of the Government. It definitely put out our school works programme for a certain period but I hope we will catch up. When schools apply for small amounts of money to carry out necessary works, whether to repair a roof, replace windows or fix a floor, for example, it is important that it be made available. These works are terribly important to a school and make a significant difference to the teachers and students. Unfortunately, over recent years many schools have had to engage in fund-raising to ensure they can operate properly. The principals, teachers and boards of management have enough to be doing in trying to educate our young people and keep the education process going without having to engage in that type of work. I hope adequate resources will always be put towards our education, irrespective of the type of school. I welcome what is stated in the programme for Government on small schools not closing. We do not want to lose any of the schools in our parishes and communities. We want to hold on to what we have. Schools are terribly important. A local school is the lifeblood of the community. Sometimes numbers can go down but, naturally, they can rise again. If a school is gone, it is gone. All we want to do is keep the door open. Along with Deputy Mattie McGrath, I welcome the increase in the number of SNAs that has been announced. It is very important and I thank every SNA in the country. They are providing a vital service in taking on board and assisting young students in every way they can. They do so in a very special way. I compliment our teachers, principals and boards of management on all the excellent work they do. Let me refer to the people who transport students to school. I wish to use this opportunity to refer to a totally ridiculous set of circumstances. Bearing in mind the talk of ageism - a word that is often used - is it not ridiculous that a man can no longer drive children to school if he is over 70? However, if he wants to pick them up at the school gate and drive them from Ballinskelligs to Donegal, he can do so in the evening. He could take them to a football match with no problem but he could not take them to school. If a man or lady aged 70 is good enough to drive a bus full of children from Malin to Mizen, surely he or she is good enough to drive them to school. Regardless of where the rule originated, could the Minister please get rid of it? The most insulting thing one can say to any person of 70 years of age is that he or she is no longer good enough to drive the young lads to school. It is ridiculous. I am not blaming the Minister but I am asking him to address this. He is a practical man. He should listen to what I am saying and talk to somebody about it. The rule should be reversed. It is totally ageist. It is insulting to people aged 70 to tell them they can no longer drive children to school when they could drive a bus of five-year-olds the length and breadth of the country perfectly legally after school. There is nothing wrong with driving them after school. They could go abroad with the children without any problem, but they could not drive the children to school. Ultimately, Deputy Richard Bruton is the Minister. I ask him to talk to whatever genius in the Department came up with that stupid idea. Will he talk to the officials and put it to them that the rule should be reversed? If we achieve nothing else tonight, this will have been an important thing to achieve.

I welcome the review of special needs provision in schools that will be carried out by the National Council for Special Education. I congratulate the Minister on his pledge to place another 860 special needs assistants in schools in the coming academic year. I welcome the decision in the programme for Government to reduce to pupil–teacher ratio for junior and senior infant classes. This is a positive step forward for primary education. I urge the Government to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio throughout the primary school classes, from junior infants through to sixth class. I call on the Government to reinstate the closed-school rule in terms of school transport and to reverse the changes proposed by the outgoing Government. These changes have the potential to have a detrimental effect on rural schools. I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the moratorium on recruitment to posts of responsibility in primary schools. Since 2009, middle management in primary schools been decimated due to a moratorium on filling middle-management posts. An example of this is a school that should have a principal, deputy principal, assistant principal and four special duty posts but which only has a principal, deputy principal and one part-time special-duty post-holder. This has resulted in an unsustainable workload being placed on senior management. Not only does senior management have an increased workload owing to the reduction in middle management, but there also has been a great increase in initiatives and changes at primary school level that management has had to deal with. I urge the Minister to reverse the moratorium. On the SUSI grant system, it is believed that the number of applications to SUSI for the upcoming academic year will surpass 110,000. I welcome the improvements that have been introduced by SUSI for 2016-17, including the earlier opening date for applications, but I urge the Minister to ensure that grant applications are processed and payments are made on time. SUSI has been running since 2012. It was disappointing to see that at the end of last November, some 20,000 students were still waiting for their student grant applications to be processed. This led to huge financial pressure on families and, undoubtedly, it forced students to drop out of their college courses. I urge the Minister to ensure this delay will not recur and to consider putting in place a provision for emergency funding should delays occur. As with other Deputies, I welcome the fact that small schools will not be closed, according to the programme for Government. Small schools play a huge role in their communities in west Cork and throughout the rest of the country. We need to protect, enhance and encourage the small schools and provide extra funding for them.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	409	Overall, these Estimates are in many ways a case of running to stand still, with a very little increase in the allocation. It makes one wonder how on earth the last Government announced tax cuts in its last budget. One wonders how they could have been justified other than as an attempt to buy the election. It was evident on all the doorsteps during the election campaign that the public was not fooled by this at all. For the first time ever, people were saying on the doorsteps they did not want tax cuts. They were asking that the Government invest in good, quality public services. Education is certainly in the top three for most people. Generally, we do formal education pretty well, be it at primary, secondary or third level. In many ways, it is in respect of the non-standard education settings that we fare less well. They need greater attention. In this regard, I am thinking about apprenticeships, adult literacy services, in-career skills development and other areas that really need investment. This area of our education system has the most potential for improvement, in terms of both worker productivity and social mobility. There is no doubt that there is a real need to focus on future provision to meet demographic pressures. IBEC gave a briefing on that today and produced figures that are certainly a matter of concern in terms of the scale of the demographic demands that will be placed on all our public services in the coming years. A couple of provisions in this year's Estimates are particularly welcome. The first is the increase this year of 2,250 in the number of teachers. It should be noted, however, that this will only reduce the primary school pupil-teacher ratio to 27:1. We still have some ground to make up if we are to achieve parity with most of our European partners.  There is considerable concern about the absence of any measure in the Estimates to address the issue of pay and equality. Many Deputies attended today's briefing by the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, at which the impact of the two-tier pay system for primary school teachers was spelt out in stark detail. INTO noted that a new entrant in 2011 will be more than €100,000 worse off over his or her career and a teacher who started in 2012 will be more than €250,000 worse off over his or her career than teachers who preceded them. This is having a significant impact on retention rates for primary school teachers. One teacher at the briefing pointed out that ten teachers in their school have taken career breaks, most of them to work in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and so forth because these places offer an opportunity to earn substantial sums and allow them to return home and do the normal things one would expect a teacher to be able to do on a teaching salary, for example, buy a house, get married and have a family. The reduction in pay for new entrants is having a significant impact on life choices for many young teachers and forcing them to leave the country to compensate for the loss of income. We will undoubtedly pay a price for this development. The issue of the degree allowance and the need to standardise payscales must be addressed because they will have implications for the quality of teaching, retention and so forth.  Expenditure on capitation has improved by only 4%, or €17 million. This additional funding must be shared among all schools, leaving a shortfall in many schools, especially those in disadvantaged areas which struggle to generate contributions from parents or to raise money through fund-raising efforts.  One of the issues that has been drawn to my attention regarding schools in disadvantaged areas is the serious difficulties they face in obtaining insurance. In some cases, schools will have experienced flooding but it is more likely that break-ins are the problem. The substantial cost of insurance is not recognised by the Department. When schools have no choice but to pay greatly increased insurance premiums, other aspects of their operations suffer as a result. This problem should be recognised.  I am concerned about the 11% reduction in expenditure on capital services. Why has this been done at a time of such serious demographic pressures? According to the Department's figures, the number of children at primary level is set to rise by several thousand, peaking at 600,000 by 2020, while the number of children at second level is set to rise to 400,000 by 2026. Capital expenditure should be increased to provide accommodation but we are doing the opposite.  The target for the number of primary schools with high-speed broadband has been set at 800, which is much too low. There is a two-tier system in place in respect of children having access to information technology. It is not acceptable to set such a low target for the provision of high-speed broadband access.  The allocation of just €4 million for skills development is also a concern. There are serious problems with the lack of apprenticeships, adequate funding for SOLAS and so forth. For example, I draw the Minister's attention to the significant shift away from upskilling and trying to get people who left school early ready to take jobs, towards efforts to have them take up low-paid jobs. The decision to transfer many staff from the education and training boards who engaged in upskilling to JobPath and the Department of Social Protection has resulted in a significant and regressive shift towards forcing adults with low levels of education into low-skilled jobs, rather than investing in increasing their skills and improving their job prospects. I will return to this issue at a later date because it is a problem. The provision of only €4 million for skills development is completely inadequate.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	410	I wish the Minister well in his new role. He has assumed a responsibility which carries the hopes of many of the various and numerous stakeholders in education. Guím gach beannacht ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna ar bhonn proifisiúnta agus go pearsanta sa Dáil seo. I echo the words of other elected Members and express my frustration that Deputies were not afforded the requisite time to consider thoroughly and interrogate properly these Estimates and their impact on our education system which is one of the most important influencers on the success of the country, the economy and, more important, society. Not only is the receipt of such figures at the 11th hour disrespectful to us, as parliamentarians, but laying them before the House in this way without a proper briefing is disrespectful to all the educators working in the sector and the young people who will ultimately be impacted by the quality of our engagement in education strategy. While I have had only a few hours to review the Estimates, I have a few comments to make. I recognise and welcome the Government’s commitment to the delivery of a strategy for education in its first 100 days and look forward to contributing positively and constructively to this strategy. However, I am not heartened by what I have read in the Estimates. While there are a few moves, small though they may be, towards trying to put right some of the deeper and more painful cuts implemented in recent years, for example, the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios and the increase of 7% in the number of special needs assistants, what I have not heard is any indication from the Minister that he intends to address the serious inequality in the teaching profession. We do not have a two-tier system but a three-tier system in which newly-qualified teachers earn in excess of 20% less than their colleagues, despite doing exactly the same job with exactly the same responsibilities as colleagues. A recent OECD report, Education at a Glance, found a direct correlation between teachers’ pay and quality of education. The teaching profession in this country has been devalued and demoralised and this will have a detrimental effect on the future quality of education. Put simply, how can the Minister justify a position that is contrary to the principle of equal pay for equal work? The programme for Government refers to principles of access, excellence, transparency and innovation and to tackling disadvantage in the education system, yet I do not see anything in the Estimates on restoring the ex quota guidance allocation to second level schools. Cuts to these services reduced the opportunity for young people to have crucial easy access to professionally trained counsellors. The removal of a dedicated guidance counselling service has widened the gap between those who have and those who have not. In some schools parents have the financial resources to ensure their children's school has access to guidance counsellors, while in other schools access to the educational, vocational and support service provided by counsellors has been radically reduced. Surely all children should have equal access to this service, irrespective of which school they attend. To ensure equal access, a financial commitment must be made to ensure the full restoration of the ex quota guidance allocation in schools and ring-fenced guidance counsellors hours to the position that obtained prior to budget 2012. This will ensure we have a dedicated fit-for-purpose guidance counsellor services in all our schools for all our children.Where in these Estimates is the statement of intent, the appetite to deliver something truly radical and innovative? The extra special needs assistants provision is of course welcome news for children and parents of children who have special educational needs. Extra psychologists for the under-resourced National Educational Psychological Service, as indicated in the programme for Government, should help to ease the waiting time for education assessments and should be welcomed too. All of this is good news, but we have nothing new here. There is no innovation. A stopgap approach to education is disappointing, to say the least. We need more than filling in the holes or easing the pressure points within the system. The programme for Government states: "We now have an opportunity to change our approach in some aspects of education". These Estimates do not indicate that such an opportunity is being taken. The opportunity to place our children's well-being centre stage is being overlooked. The Department should look at establishing a task force to design and deliver evidence-based strategies to promote resilience within our schools, utilising the top experts in the field. We need to be evidence-based and standardised in our approach. Funding should be provided for initiating research into what strategies and interventions can be harnessed within school communities to reduce children's vulnerability to depression and anxiety. In many countries all schools, primary and secondary, have a full-time school-based counsellor. In Britain, schools are piloting mindfulness-based programmes where leader schools provide other schools with education and resources. I am not suggesting for one minute that we increase the pressure on our under-resourced, overstretched and demoralised teachers. However, there is an opportunity to try something new and initiate a pilot project on building resilience and teaching mindfulness to our children. There needs to be a formal link, a new conversation, between the Departments of Health and Education and Skills to promote mental wellness among our children, provide them with pathways to inner happiness, allow them to discover and develop their inner strengths and provide them with the tools for coping with challenges. Too often, our children can attain wonderful results in the leaving certificate but crumble to pieces when confronted with their first crisis in college or the workplace. If this new politics is to present an opportunity to shape collectively the future of education in our country, as the Minister said tonight, then I respectfully request that members of the education committee hear from the Minister next month on his specific spending proposals for 2017. Members of the committee should be informed of what the Department has been negotiating with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of same.

#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	412	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the 2016 Revised Estimates for the Department of Education and Skills. Expenditure on education is vital if we are to continue to thrive as a nation. Education gives everyone an opportunity to further their career prospects. For 2016 the education budget is over €8.7 billion. Of this, approximately 93% or almost €8.2 billion will be spent on current expenditure while approximately €600 million will be spent on capital expenditure. A further €362 million is being allocated to the national training fund. To put these figures in context a total of 17% of all Government current expenditure will be spent on education with almost 15% of all Government capital expenditure spent on school capital projects. Let us consider the figures in more detail. The breakdown of €8.67 billion in current expenditure is as follows. Second and early years education accounts for almost €6.3 billion. Skills development accounts for almost €340 million. Higher education will account for over €1.5 billion. Capital services will account for almost €600 million. Almost 80% of the total current expenditure will be on pay and pensions. It is interesting to note that, of this figure, some €5.3 billion is allocated to pay almost 101,000 whole-time education posts and a further €1.16 billion is allocated to cover the ongoing pensions and retirement lump sum payments to over 46,000 pensioners. The Estimates provide that for 2016 there will be 66,025 teachers in schools throughout the country, an increase of 2,250 teachers over the levels of last year. I very much welcome this. I very much welcome the fact that almost €1.5 billion is allocated to special educational needs. This represents an increase of 10% in the past two years. Included in these figures is an allocation of 11,800 learning support and resource teachers in primary and post-primary schools. There will be an increase of over 600 posts in the current year. It is worth noting that the total number of resource teaching posts has increased by 41% since 2011. I was delighted that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced an additional 860 special needs assistant posts for this coming September. This will bring the total number of SNAs to 12,900, an increase of over 22% since 2011. The schools capital programme is receiving an allocation of €542 million. While I welcome the amount allocated I am somewhat disappointed that this budget has already been allocated to projects. I have received a large amount of correspondence from concerned constituents on this matter and I call on the Minister to reconsider the capital programme with a view to increasing the budget. For example, Scoil Naomh Feichín outside Drogheda, County Louth has recently received correspondence stating that while its project has been approved, the funding has not been sanctioned due to the fact the budget for this year has been reached. Again, I call on the Minister to reconsider the capital programme for schools. Many positive developments are taking place in my constituency of Louth, where we are starting to see the benefits of the continuing economic improvements. In Dundalk, the Marist College has recently opened a brand new school, a singular credit to those involved. Dundalk has recently seen approval for a new extension to Scoil Realt na Mara and Dún Dealgan National School has received the go-ahead for a much-needed extension. I note that the third level sector allocation is a little over €1.4 billion with over €900 million funding for universities, institutes of technology and other higher education institutions. A further €407 million has been reserved for student support and almost €40 million for research activities. While I very much welcome the allocation for third level education, I fear it is not enough. In the past week I met with the president of Dundalk Institute of Technology, Anne Campbell. She outlined to me in great detail the challenges faced by DkIT as a result of reduced funding. I urge the Minister to re-examine the funding with a view to providing increased funding to third level institutes, in particular, DkIT, which is the only institute of technology in the north east of the country and provides an important service to the students of the area, especially those students based in County Louth. I welcome the fact that funding has been increased for the education sector but I urge the Minister to consider increasing all allocations to the third level sector, in particular DkIT in Dundalk. Furthermore, I urge him to make additional funding available for the schools capital programme so that schools like Scoil Naomh Feichín can proceed with projects. I wish the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the best of luck in future as Minister for Education and Skills.

To continue from where the Minister's colleague finished, I had three lots of speeches and I was deciding where to start. I am addressing the revised edition but I think I will start with the capitation programme for the future. I plead with the Minister to reconsider this and, for the period 2017 to 2019, to consider front-loading the programme for building schools. I am no different from my colleague across the House in that I am under pressure in east Galway on a regular basis from constituents in the likes of Bullaun, where the school is still operating out of prefabs. It is on the building programme but the building programme is almost turning into a health and safety issue at the moment. There are three schools in Athenry and one in Tuam on the building programme as well. Anyway, if the Minister would consider front-loading the programme, it would be greatly appreciated. I welcome the reduction in class sizes and the allocation of the extra teachers and SNAs. I believe the programme based around apprenticeships is vital for this economy to progress and there is no better place to start than with the role of apprenticeships.The ETBs are extremely well positioned to do that and have done it for some years. The 25 additional apprenticeship courses coming on stream are really appreciated. We need to look back to the traditional courses of block-laying and roofing as well as looking to the ESB and the OPW. We have a set body of State-funded employers that could give these opportunities to the young people who want to avail of apprenticeships. Regarding ETBs and further education, I was very disheartened to discover that last year that the GRETB had to return an amount of money it could not spend on further adult education as a result of the staffing embargo. That ETB did not have the staff to deliver the courses but had the funding to do so. There does not seem to be a balance. I ask the Government to try to restore that equilibrium. It is evident that the ETB had the funding but it returning the money because it did not have the staff to deliver it was very disheartening for those working in the ETB. When talking about the ETBs we also need to talk about the ICT services they provide. SOLAS, FÁS and the ETBs have come together successfully, particularly in the context of the GRETB in my area. They have actually pulled it all together with no staff. The one part that is really stretched is the infrastructure around ICT. I can also talk about ICT in the national schools. The national schools have computers but do not have the support mechanisms to bring them online. That is another issue. If a national school has an ETB nearby it has that access to resources. However, many rural schools do not have that support. Geography should not come into it and all children in education should be equal. That is not the case because geography plays a huge part in all this. This is something we will have to look at and broadband of course comes into this. Apart from broadband, the next issue that is crucifying rural areas - a number of Deputies spoke about it earlier this evening - is that which relates to how school transport is gauged. We have to move away from looking at it from the satellite. The satellite currently takes dirt tracks rather than roads into account when the position is being assessed. One Deputy referred to the distance measured in kilometres. School buses are passing people by at present. A student who lives at the wrong part of the triangle on a school bus route can lose out. A student living in Claregalway who wants to travel to the new school in Galway might be sent over to Headford and be obliged to go 5 km up the other side of the road to try to catch the bus. This does not make sense, particularly when the bus passes his or her front door in the first instance. Having said that, I welcome what is before us. I think we are going in the right direction. We want to invest correctly in education because children represent the future. We need to give them the broadband, the school buses and the schools in which to be taught well.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23103	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	415	I welcome the debate. Everyone will agree that there have been tough times for education as there have been for other sectors throughout the economy. The education system in Ireland has been extraordinarily resilient during those times. It has taught more children at primary, secondary and third level with reduced resources. Deputy Thomas Byrne and others rightly pointed out that we have had, one might say, a lost decade. It was not quite a decade but approaching a decade in which investment has been below level. It will continue with financial pressures. We need to be smarter in the way we do things. I hope we can repair the damage while also having ambitions to do things in new ways. That is part of what I would like to see done. Deputy Thomas Byrne raised his concern that we are investing in the concept of technological universities before we have the legislation. To be fair, this has a long history; it is long before my time here. The DIT has developed a project with Blanchardstown and Tallaght that is at a very advanced stage. They are keen to move ahead. Everyone engaged is fully committed and sees it as a win-win. Cork and Tralee have also developed their projects. Waterford and Carlow are developing projects. This is not a new idea. While the legislation is very important, the concept is something that has broadly been seen as important to regional development. To take up the Deputy's point, it is not about shutting off access in particular locations and consolidating all into one centre at the loss of others. It is to allow a system that may be stretched and challenged to retain its best traditions while also setting new ambition. I look forward to working with the Deputy on this. We are committed to stakeholder engagement on the issue so that when we move back into Committee Stage we can hopefully have a much better understanding of different perspectives. Deputy Cullinane and others raised the issues of the differential in pay. I recognise that this is a problem. It is a legacy of the crash and it occurred in every part of the public service. Contrary to what Deputy Connolly said, Deputies are also paid different amounts depending on their recruitment. This is an issue. There will be a pay commission, which will give an opportunity to look at this and develop ways because we need to retain our capacity to attract the very best people into education. Deputy Burton raised her concern that the capital programme had gone off track. At the end of May it was pretty much on the mark at 98.5% of profile. So it is slightly below. We intend to spend all the money that will be available to us. The Department's building unit - perhaps this is part of the frustration - has developed projects and is trying to ensure we spend everything we have and be in a position to have the pipeline to do so. I will look into the particular schools she mentioned. A number of Deputies talked about the importance of DEIS and the ambition to change. I recognise the frustration that some schools have been outside it and it has not been reviewed in several years. The purpose of the review is to look at not just that issue of whether some schools are left out, but also the quality of the programmes and whether we could do better within the DEIS schools. The benchmarking of numeracy, which was mentioned by Deputy Connolly, is an important issue. Deputy Michael Collins raised the issue of middle management. To be fair to the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the Estimate she produced contains a provision for 250 teacher posts to try to bolster the middle-management tier. There is no doubt that leadership in our schools will be very important. A number of people spoke about guidance. I know that is a particular concern of Deputy Thomas Byrne and his party. The budget produced by the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, included a restoration of the pupil-teacher ratio at post-primary level, albeit not ex quota, but nonetheless with guidelines being issued to the schools to deploy this in guidance. While putting guidance ex quota impacted on the provision of guidance as is evident, it is interesting that a significant level of guidance was protected by schools. Hopefully we can meet the ambitions that those have raised. I share Deputy Rabbitte's point of view on the need for a stronger digital strategy within the educational system and hopefully we can do that. Deputy Fitzpatrick has gone, but I will talk to him separately.
