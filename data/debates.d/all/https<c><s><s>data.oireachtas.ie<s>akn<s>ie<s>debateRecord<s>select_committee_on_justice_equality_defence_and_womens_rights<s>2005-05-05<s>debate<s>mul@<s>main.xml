          <p eId="para_37">In page 13, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following subsection:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_38">"(2) A liaison officer shall be independent in the performance of his or her functions.".</p>
          <p eId="para_39">This amendment would insert a new provision in the Bill to allow the liaison officer to be independent in the performance of his or her functions. The Irish Human Rights Commission strongly supports the inclusion of such a measure and maintains that there is no requirement for the liaison officer to perform his or her functions independently in the same manner as the Bill provides in respect of assessment officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">The drawing up of the statement is the function of the Health Service Executive. The key provisions in this regard are contained in subsection (6) to ensure a service statement will apply only in so far as practicality and budgetary constraints will allow. Liaison officers are charged with determining how these factors impact on the service statement and the assessment report is listed as one of the six factors to be considered. This is an issue that should be considered because it is very important for the liaison officer to be independent, even though such officers are appointed by the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">There is a question mark against the independence of assessment officers who are also appointed by the Health Service Executive, particularly when the chief executive officer can decide how long they will remain in their posts. For example, last night the DLCG, the Government's consultative group, claimed it had been betrayed by the Minister and issued a very strong statement claiming the Bill was inadequate and fatally flawed. I think the chairperson, Angela Kerins, was involved in issuing the statement. I do not know whether the Minister of State will take the DLCG's response to the Bill into account. Every organisation which represents people with disabilities opposes the Bill but I am not sure if the Minister of State is listening to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">Every organisation concerned with disability issues appears to be opposed to the Bill. When the DLCG issues such a strong statement claiming that the Bill is completely flawed and calls it a betrayal, it is important the Minister of State responds and lets the select committee know what he will do about the matter because it is very worrying that such groups have no confidence in the Bill. They now claim full consultation is urgently required. Is the committee wasting its time on the Bill if the experts in every organisation are completely opposed to it? The DLCG was appointed by the Government and it opposes the Bill. I am aware that it had problems in meeting the Minister in recent months but the situation is now serious. If the people for whom we are working — the amendment aims to specifically assist people with disabilities — are completely opposed to the Bill and are talking about disengaging from discussions with the Government, are we wasting our time debating it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I support Deputy Stanton's amendment. Independence in any walk of life is crucially important. For the person who needs a holistic approach to services, the person assessing or implementing services needs to be independent. The difficulty we have with the connection with the Health Board Executive is that if officers are drawn from within the system — I made this point the other day on another amendment about the need for independence within the system — it will not be possible for them to be genuinely independent in making their assessments. It is asking the impossible from people who have worked within an organisation for a long time and know it intimately.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The Minister of State needs to tell the select committee whether Mr. Cearbhaill O'Meara was telling the truth yesterday morning on "Morning Ireland". The Minister of State said the previous morning that it had been fully explained to Mr. O'Meara that he was not excluded under the provisions of the Bill. Mr. O'Meara is a highly intelligent man who made a presentation to the committee. He said on "Morning Ireland" that he was excluded. We need to ask the Minister of State whether he intends to proceed with the Bill as we discuss its more serious elements. Will he proceed with it if the people it is supposed to serve and the persons he appointed to advise him are deeply unhappy with it? Did he have any connection with disability groups as the discussions were ongoing or did he merely consult his civil servants? Did those who drafted the Bill have any discussions with the DCLG? It appears the Bill is structured and written in a very clinical and narrow way and that it was not written by a politician. We need to hear from the Minister of State because of what has happened in recent days since the commencement of Committee Stage. I would hate to think the committee is wasting its time. The Minister of State needs to clarify whether Mr. O'Meara was telling the truth on "Morning Ireland".</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I strongly support amendment No. 103 because it is a very important and constructive amendment. It gets to the heart of this part of the legislation. The key word in the amendment is "independent" because the liaison officer has to focus on the person with the disability. The liaison officer's responsibility is to the person with the disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I share the concerns of many of my colleagues about the Bill and ask the Minister of State to listen to the various groups which work with people with disabilities and people with disabilities themselves because their concerns should be listened to. If we are serious about having inclusive discussions — I am aware the Minister of State has met people with disabilities and disability groups — we should never stop listening.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">The amendment states a liaison officer should be independent in the performance of his or her functions. It is a positive and constructive amendment because the liaison officer's primary duty is to the person with the disability, regardless of whether it is a physical or intellectual disability. The key phrase is "in the performance of his or her functions" in order that he or she would be constantly allowed to carry out his or her functions in such a way as to ensure the person with the disability came first.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I wished to clarify the issue raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">On amendment No. 103 and in response to Deputy Stanton's question, the Bill provides that the assessment officer will be independent and have responsibility for delivering an assessment of need for each individual. In addition, the assessment will be undertaken without regard to the cost of the services envisaged or the capacity of the executive to provide them. The independence of the assessment officer is essential to the process and responds to a key concern of the disability interest groups in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">The liaison officer has a different role and it is equally essential that he or she is part of the executive and involved in managing the needs of people with disabilities within the practical constraints that apply from time to time. His or her role is to prepare a deliverable service statement. He or she will have knowledge and understanding of service issues and the demands on services as well as related resource implications and the capacity of the executive to respond in individual cases. In the light of the role envisaged for the liaison officer in the Bill, it would be inappropriate to assign him or her the statutory independence proposed by the amendment. For that reason, I will not accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I hope the members of the select committee will understand the liaison officer is a critical person in putting in place a service statement to meet the needs of the individual taking account of the constraints that apply. As I stated previously, the role of the liaison officer is important in the continual review of service statements, taking account of additional resources coming on stream or a change in the circumstances of the person involved. It would not make sense or be necessary to give him or her statutory independence. For that reason, I am rejecting the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_32">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_67">It appears the assessment officer will carry out the assessment and is independent, even though he or she is appointed and employed by the Health Service Executive. The liaison officer will receive the service statement, at which point the first trap door or shutter will come down on the Bill. That is what people are worried about. The liaison officer is not independent in the performance of his or her functions and must take account of resources and the executive's priorities. The Minister of State is saying he or she must do what he or she is told by the CEO. The service statement provided will be qualified and modified from this point on. The services available to persons with a disability can be curtailed at this juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">An issue was raised about prioritising service needs, a concern of many. If the liaison officer was independent, this is something he or she would be able to accomplish immediately. There are statements in the Bill to the effect that the liaison officer must take account of resources and so forth in preparing a service statement. This is made clear in Part 6. The issues of practicality and eligibility are addressed therein. Everything the Minister of State has mentioned is covered by the Bill. We are trying to give the liaison officer more freedom.</p>

It refers to the assessment report, the eligibility of the applicant, approved standards, the practicality of providing services, the need to ensure, in the case of a service to be provided by a health board, that the provision of the services would not, if implemented, result in net expenditure by the board in excess of the amount determined by the Minister and so on. Everything the Minister of State has said is covered in spades.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The liaison officer, even though he or she is appointed by and employed by the Health Service Executive, should have more freedom in preparing the service statement. He or she should be independent in bringing the statement together in order to prioritise the needs of the person concerned while keeping in mind, if necessary, the shackles the Minister is placing on him or her under this subsection.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">We must be realistic. The liaison officer is in a position to do this. He or she is not required to be independent in doing so. If Deputy Stanton was bringing forward this legislation, attention would have to be paid to the issues raised in section 10(6), unless he could produce a magic wand for every liaison officer. The liaison officer has the task of drafting a service statement based on the ability of the service to deliver for the individual concerned. That is the reality, regardless of which parties are in government. An assessment statement contains the ideal provisions but has no regard for the resources available. The next step is for the liaison officer to assist the individual concerned in the preparation of a service statement which must take into account the services that can be delivered. If the Deputy was in government today, that would not change.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Let us be realistic. The only way there can be change is with continuous increases in resources to make up the difference between the unfulfilled needs in the service statement and the requirements listed in the statement of assessment. I am not pulling the wool over anyone's eyes. Let us be frank and acknowledge that no Government can wave a magic wand and provide all the services one would desire. The challenge for Government is to try to provide the necessary resources. The Bill is specific in identifying needs that have not been met, correlating them on a macro basis and providing the Dáil with a figure for extra resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Half of the Budget Statement was spent expressing the desire of the Minister for Finance to deliver significant extra resources, the first time that had happened in the history of the State.</p>

The reality is that its provisions are based on a significant increase in resources, as outlined by the Minister for Finance. A sum of €900 million has been provided over a five year period. The Minister also has the ability to increase this amount in any year over the period. Ten years ago there was an increase of £1 million per year. It does not matter who was in government at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">I find it difficult to accept the notion that to face reality is to accept the <i>status quo</i>. Consider the reality of the lives of people with disabilities. I thought this legislation was supposed to improve their lives rather than maintain the <i>status quo</i>. If the liaison officer has to take account of what is available, he or she will play no role. He or she shields the Government from the anger of people with disabilities. The service statement will be returned with red lines through the recommendations. This legislation is about people with disabilities becoming equal citizens rather than restricting their opportunities to so do. The Minister of State must face reality and note that there are people advising him whose agenda is to protect the Government. That is their job. If that is the case, let us have the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">One cannot say to someone that his or her only entitlement is based on what is available. The Minister of State claims that as resources become available, additional services will become part of the service statement. On the contrary, the Bill states there is no ongoing process. There is a time limit on appeals. After a certain period, one can no longer appeal, even though one may not have what one needs. How can the Minister of State present this as a work in progress? It is not. The Minister should consult those who advise him and question their motives. What he is telling us and what the Bill states are entirely different. It is the job of public representatives to articulate the feelings of people without a voice. This is not a Bill of which we will be proud.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">The Minister of State spoke about the macro issues before the select committee but if he is so sure about what he is doing, why is the Government's consultative group so strongly against the Bill? I have never seen such a strong statement. It describes the Bill as a betrayal of the hopes of people with disabilities and as fatally flawed. If the Bill is so good, why is that the reaction of the groups established to advise the Minister of State? This statement has not been issued lightly but follows a long thought process. It is the reaction of genuine people who are experts with years of experience. I do not know if the Minister of State has seen what his own consultative group has stated. If the experts state the Bill is fatally flawed, it is a serious issue. I am not attempting to score political points as the issue is too serious and deals with the most vulnerable people in our society who need our help and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">I welcome the moves made on the provision of financial support and I am thankful the economy allows us to do so. We are all more enlightened now about people with disabilities and see them as people. The first point I made on the Bill was that the word "people" must be included in the Title.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Section 10(6) states that, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2), in preparing a service statement the liaison officer concerned shall have regard to the factors listed within that subsection which we will debate later and perhaps change. A liaison officer must have a certain amount of independence to carry out his or her work. We know how pressures can be brought to bear on people in the health executive when preparing service statements. The Bill should give some protection to allow the liaison officer more independence and provide that pressure cannot be brought to bear on the liaison officer in order that he or she can properly carry out the functions of the job, but within the parameters the Minister of State is rightly or wrongly setting down in subsection (6).</p>
          <p eId="para_93">The Irish Human Rights Commission, a highly respected independent body, strongly recommended to the committee on 15 November 2004 that the liaison officer should be independent in the performance of his or her functions. The Minister of State claims to listen to everyone but if he had listened to the disability legislation consultation group, it would not be up in arms now. He has also closed his mind to this proposal brought forward by the Irish Human Rights Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">I suspect the Minister of State has been sent here and told not to give an inch on the Bill. He has no discretion and is merely holding the line. By contrast, when Deputy Noel Dempsey was Minister for Education and Science, he listened to and engaged with Deputies on Committee Stage of a particular Bill. If our argument was strong enough, he agreed to consider it and returned on Report Stage with further amendments to change the focus of the Bill which was welcomed across the board as good legislation but that is not happening here. I question the Minister of State's authority to make changes.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I take the comments on amendment No. 103 but it is important we realise when discussing the amendment and the Bill that groups such as NAMI which represents 28,000 people involved in services have genuine concerns and recently expressed criticism about the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The Minister of State spoke of the bad old days when there were increases of only €1 million in the budget which was both appalling and disgraceful. The most recent budget was enlightened and at the time I commended and thanked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for his work. That does not mean, however, that we can take our eye off the ball and remove the focus from respecting people with disabilities and their rights as citizens. Approximately 3,000 people in the intellectual disability sector are on day care, respite care and residential care waiting lists. That is not a huge figure and the problem should be solved within one or two budgets but I am concerned that the piecemeal effect will be that despite the huge increase in resources, money will not be spent on the 3,000 people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Everyone in the House has a responsibility to listen to the valuable opinion of the Irish Human Rights Commission and other disability groups. The bottom line is that the Department of Finance's fingerprints are all over the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">The liaison officer is charged by the chief executive officer to produce a service statement. Does the Bill contain a timeline within which preparations must begin or be completed? The timeframe appears to be unclear, although I may have missed the reference. If the liaison officer is extremely busy, he or she may delay starting the statement for up to four months. How long will it then take to furnish the document?</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Is there an onus on members of the executive and others to co-operate with the liaison and assessment officers? This matter struck me just a few minutes ago. If the liaison or assessment officer asks for information or assistance, it will be important that officials of the HSE co-operate. The Bill is unclear on whether this must be done. Members of the HSE may work under pressure and be involved with internal politics. The Minister of State might bring forward wording on Report Stage to the effect that assistance would be forthcoming when a request is made by the liaison or assessment officer. A liaison officer who is preparing a service statement may find it frustrating to be fobbed off by a high official of the HSE and told to return the following week for the necessary information. The Minister of State should explore the issues of responsibility and reasonable timeframes, including the determination of who decides on them. The preparation of these statements may be simple or complicated.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">A serious look at section 10 will reveal it to be the money saving section of the Bill. Let us pretend that this Bill will perform all the tasks the Minister of State claims for it by allowing people more independence and the opportunities to become involved in society and to find employment. I agree with the disabled community when it says that the potential contribution by people with disabilities to the economy has not been realised. It will not cost as much as we believe. Contributions can be made if the right supports are put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">My amendment to delete section 10(6)(<i>b</i>) was ruled out of order because of the potential charge to the Exchequer. This is why I believe this section will contain most of the money saving elements. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) refers to “the eligibility of the applicant for services under the Health Acts 1947 to 2004”. What exactly is meant by “eligibility” and what are the criteria? Will eligibility be determined by the means test for a medical card or for disability allowance? Whereas section 10 is restrictive in other areas, for example, by setting out what the liaison officer cannot do, the wording for this paragraph is loose. The means test criteria for a child diagnosed with a disability differ from those for the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">What exactly is referred to by "services"? Will a minimum wage earner or someone earning €50 more be over the limit? Will someone on disability allowance earning an additional €100 be over? As with the Ombudsman issue, we need to know about this before voting on section 10.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I was not present on Tuesday and that might be just as well. The more I have listened this morning, the more frustrating it is getting. The Bill is fundamentally flawed, especially section 10. Part 2, which contains sections 6 to 22, should be rewritten from scratch. It is difficult to make minor amendments or suggestions. On Report Stage, I will table a substantial amendment to delete and replace sections 6 to 22. This will fundamentally refocus the Bill in line with what was suggested by the disability legislation consultation group, DLGC, which called for the establishment of an independent disability support service and all that flows from that. That is covered in section 10 among others. That is the only way we can give those who are disabled the rights they deserve. The Bill is formulated in too bureaucratic a way. The proposals are tied too much to the health service. The proposed structures are not independent and I do not believe they will realise or deliver on the needs of the disabled community in the near future. The Bill does not represent the way we should be planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Even now, we still have an opportunity to change the legislation. It is a pity that, from what I have heard from him so far this morning, the Minister of State does not seem intent on doing so. It is as if everything the Minister or the Government produces is fully correct and we are all wrong and the disabled, the advocacy groups and some of the legal advice that some individuals have received is wrong. It is as if the Minister of State is infallible. I do not think that is the case. If we proceed with the Bill and with section 10 in particular, we will create a bureaucratic maze. In a few years' time, we will be admitting that we have produced a monster which eats up all the money that could instead have been invested in services or assessments. There will be service statements, liaison officers and all the rest of the bureaucratic maze. I will propose a major amendment in the hope that, even as late as Report Stage, the Minister of State might decide the Bill can be amended.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">A point on eligibility was made by Deputy Lynch. All health services are governed by eligibility. The medical card is the main form of eligibility, and it applies to people with disabilities. Therefore, anybody who qualifies for the medical card gets services.

The same criteria of eligibility that apply across the health service apply in the case of disabled people.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">This is why I tabled my amendment. If the intention of the Bill is to encourage people back into society and the workforce, no one or very few people will be eligible for the services provided by the Health Service Executive. I have a major difficulty with that. A paper was produced about two years ago on the cost of disability. It said that being disabled had a particular cost relating to lifestyle, transport, heating, medical bills and so on. That is never taken into consideration when eligibility tests are put in place. I need to know whether the first thing garnered from the interview with the assessment officer is the person's eligibility. Will the plan proceed if a person is not eligible? Might it be possible for it to take place only for people to discover later that they cannot get the services because they are not eligible? There is no point in people being registered as disabled if that is the case. We all need to know about this as it is vital to the proper planning of society. What is the point if people are found to be ineligible for any of the services set out in the Bill? Will the first thing to be determined be eligibility or will that be determined at a later stage?

          <p eId="para_170">I support Deputy Lynch on this important matter. Section 10(6) states: "Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)</i>, in preparing a service statement the liaison officer concerned shall have regard to the following”. There are then six items after that. The first one, “the assessment report concerned”, will have already been produced. The matter of eligibility does not arise there. Any citizen can get an assessment report, as we clarified previously. People can ask for one and they will get one, even if they are not entitled to a particular service, provided resources are not an issue. That is not clear. The DLCG is certainly not clear about the matter. The second factor is “the eligibility of the applicant for services under the Health Acts 1947 to 2004”. It is important that the Minister of State clarifies this matter. If it means that only those with medical cards will be eligible for services under the Health Acts, that means everyone else is ineligible. What the Minister of State should do, if I can be so bold as to suggest this, is to provide the committee with a comprehensive brief on what subsection (6)(<i>b</i>) is all about and who is eligible under the Health Acts. Subsection (6) provides that “the liaison officer concerned shall have regard to the following...”. He or she must not only have regard to it, he or she must do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">We do not know what the approved standards and codes of practice will be but I assume they will be positive. The issue of the practicability of providing the services identified in the assessment report is major. Many groups are concerned given that the practicability of providing the services identified in the assessment report is so open. It does not put an onus on the Health Service Executive to make an effort. If the HSE says it has no wheelchairs, therefore, it is not practicable to provide a bed or whatever. It does not put an onus on the executive to make an effort to get the bed. As a result of the practicability of providing services, it does not have to do so if it does not wish. There is a way out in that paragraph.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">In regard to subsection (6)(<i>e</i>)(i), I can understand what the Minister of State has said that the provision of the services should not result in net expenditure by the board in excess of the amount determined by the Minister. The hope is that enough money will be provided by the Minister to ensure that does not arise and also, as provided in subparagraph (ii), that it would not result in the indebtedness of the board exceeding the amount specified by the Minister pursuant to that section. If enough funding is provided, those issues will not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The other issues and certainly the issue of the eligibility of the applicant for services under the Health Acts 1947 to 2004 will arise. I understand that any citizen is entitled to a public bed in a public hospital.</p>

That is a real need that a person with a disability may want. What is the requirement to become eligible for a personal assistant and which of the Health Acts 1947 to 2004 apply? This is the kind of detail that should be contained in a briefing document from the Minister to help us tease it out. All of us have reservations but the Minister, in good faith, can have this section passed. When it is enacted, we may find there are various trap doors, barriers and high jumps to be encountered to become eligible. It is important that this section be clarified without undue delay. There is a reference to the Health Acts 1947 to 2004. I do not know how many Health Acts there are. Given that people must be eligible, how are they eligible?</p>

          <p eId="para_177">If we are open and honest, this Bill is about changing the goalposts as they previously existed for people with disabilities. That is what we all expected from the Bill. One cannot have enshrined in it an eligibility criterion which relates back to a system which the Minister of State agrees did not serve people with disabilities well. How does one qualify for a personal assistant if one has a job when the personal assistant is a necessary part of one maintaining that job? How does one qualify for a hearing aid if one is profoundly deaf? If one is in need of a hearing aid, which is an expensive item, and has a job, how does one qualify? It appears that one must be living in poverty to become eligible and that people with disabilities will have to get over this hurdle.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs sent a circular to community welfare superintendents stating there was no discretion. Therefore, there is no flexibility in regard to eligibility for medical cards. The deletion of this subparagraph would not open the floodgates and would not give those with disabilities <i>carte blanche </i>because many other hurdles must be overcome. My amendment which was ruled out of order dealt with this issue. For example, the hurdle of the liaison officer, in putting together a service plan, having to take into account what is available would result in a trickle as opposed to a flood. This is a money saving exercise. While there would be a charge on the Exchequer if it were removed, it should not have been included in the first place. If this Bill does what it is supposed to do, namely, to encourage people with disabilities back into the community and work, it will ensure that half of those with disabilities will not be eligible for any service.</p>

We are asked to vote but we are not sure what we are voting for because the Minister of State cannot tell us the eligibility criteria. On the one hand he said it is the medical card. Medical card eligibility is restrictive and is based on income. I am aware there is a certain discretion on the part of health executive area CEOs. My experience is that if a family income level exceeds a certain amount, one is not eligible for the service. People must also return for regular assessment. Even if one has a permanent enduring substantial restriction or impairment, he or she must be re-assessed for the card regularly. We are discovering that the number of people eligible for services could be quite small and could equal the number who have disabilities and who have a medical card. If one does not have a medical card, one will not be eligible for services under the Bill. The Minister of State cannot tell us whether that is the case. If it is the case that one must have a medical card to be eligible for the services, I would like to know before proceeding further.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">This section provides that a copy of the service statement will be furnished to the applicant but it does not state when it will be furnished. The Minister of State has tabled an amendment which provides that the service statement shall be prepared without undue delay but it does not provide that the copy of the statement must be furnished immediately or as soon as possible.

If there is no money available and the assessments have been carried out, how will people know when or if they will get services? Will there be waiting lists on a first come, first served basis or will the people in greatest need be prioritised? How will that be resolved because it is not clear from the Bill?</p>

The liaison officer has discretion and does not have to furnish a copy of the assessment report but if he or she has the consent of the applicant or an appropriate person, he or she can provide it where considered appropriate for a public body. Ultimately, the public body will have to be supplied with a copy.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Amendment No. 130 provides that where a public body is furnished with a copy of the assessment report under section 11(1), a member of staff of the body shall communicate with the applicant concerned or, where appropriate, the person referred to and the liaison officer concerned. This involves the substitution of "or" with "and". The assessment report, not the service statement, will be furnished. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the service statement supersedes the assessment report? Once the service statement is prepared, it will become the working document and the assessment report will not have a role. Public bodies and so on should only be concerned about the service statement at that stage because the assessment has been through the filter of the liaison officer who establishes what cannot be done and only allows through what is practicable, affordable or eligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">My final amendment states, "The public body shall communicate with the persons in this subsection the information regarding services that may be provided by the public body that it considers that the applicant is entitled to, as soon as practicable after receiving the assessment report, but within a maximum period of 6 weeks after receipt of the assessment report.".</p>

Even if the response is negative, it is important that the communication should be made. The service statement will be in place and will not impose additional work other than ensuring the communication is dealt with in an efficient manner. That would tidy up the section. My other amendment is the same as Deputy Stanton's and is intended to ensure the liaison officer would receive a copy of the service statement in order that this provision is not loose similar to other provisions in the legislation.

Amendment No. 131 is important in terms of ensuring public bodies communicate with persons regarding the services that may be provided. It is all very well to provide the assessment but it must be ensured, when the assessment has been completed, the person with the disability is provided with services. This refers to the ethos of the debate. While we differ with the Minister of State on the fundamental issues and refer to the rights of people, we must ensure people with disabilities are guaranteed services as a right. This should be done in a professional and caring way. I commend Deputies Stanton and Murphy on this amendment.</p>

The amendment would go beyond offering the applicant the option of support by placing an onus on the liaison officer and the applicant to comply with the subsection. As sensitive personal information is likely to be part of the assessment report, I would not like a change to the subsection that would put a level of compulsion on the applicant. For these reasons, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Amendment No. 129 would oblige a public body to communicate "forthwith" with an applicant. Such an obligation would be extremely onerous and unlikely to result in the worthwhile and considered response to which the applicant would be entitled. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Amendment No. 130 would oblige a public body to communicate with the representative of an applicant and the liaison officer. This may not be the most appropriate way to proceed as it would not be conducive to achieving clarity. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Amendment No. 131 would require public bodies to communicate with the applicant or representative within a maximum of six weeks. I have sympathy with the intent of this amendment in trying to ensure prompt attention for applicants. However, as this provision would apply to a range of bodies which provide a variety of services, it is not possible to be so prescriptive as to whether the liaison officer or the representative of the applicant is to act on behalf of the applicant as to the timing of a response. That response will, in general, be governed by the arrangements for service delivery pertaining to the particular service.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">I do not understand the Minister of State's explanation regarding amendment No. 129. It would not take from the considered response which I expect to be delivered to the applicant. The intent of the amendment is not to ensure a half thought out response would be sent. Nobody should do this but, after everything is considered, there should be communication with the applicant. The Minister of State thinks the officer could communicate too soon without having all the facts before him or her but that is not what we seek. We are asking that when everything has been considered, the response should be immediate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_249">I accept what the Minister of State said. I will withdraw my amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">On amendment No. 130, while the legislation gives a certain freedom to the public body, it is important that the liaison officer be kept informed of anything that might occur. It should be mandatory that the liaison officer is told what the public body is doing. The wording of the legislation would allow the liaison officer to be left out of the loop at the discretion of the public body. A copy of any communication with the applicant should have to go to the liaison officer as well. I accept that sensitive information could be involved in some cases but the liaison officer is a professional. It is important to keep the liaison officer informed for the purpose of facilitating or co-ordinating the provision of any service, which is the liaison officer's job.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">One could foresee a situation where the public body could communicate with the applicant and the liaison officer may know nothing about it and could operate in parallel. To facilitate co-ordination, co-operation and a team approach, when a public body sends information to an applicant that they will or will not provide a service, the professional liaison officer should be informed and kept up-to-date as a matter of course, courtesy and professionalism. Changing the word "or" to "and" will have this effect. In this day and age, it is often just a matter of sending another e-mail or copy of a letter so that the liaison officer is informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">While the section deals with exchanging information, this subsection makes it discretionary. I do not understand why, but it might suit a public body to keep the liaison officer out of the loop because he or she could be in a position to ensure that a service is delivered. It could cause all sorts of conflict. The liaison officer could become quite annoyed with a public body if he or she is not informed and the public body does not have an obligation under the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">Exactly. It is important to change the word "or" to "and". The Minister of State said he sympathised with the proposal that the public body should communicate with the persons in this subsection the information regarding services that may be provided by the public body that it considers that the applicant is entitled to, as soon as practicable after receiving the assessment report, but within a maximum period of six weeks after receipt of the assessment report. Perhaps six weeks is too short but I am open to changing that. Perhaps we will change it to a longer period on Report Stage. If the Minister will consider changing it to a longer period, which would be more appropriate, I am willing to withdraw my amendment. Perhaps he will consider amendment No. 131 for Report Stage, but amendment No. 130 is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">Having to report to the two would not be conducive to achieving clarity. The intention is that the appropriate person acting on behalf of the person with the disability, if he or she cannot act on his or her own behalf, by and large, should be the person to whom the public body would refer back. Including the two people means there is no onus on either to act. In a normal situation, referring back to the appropriate person would mean the onus is on the appropriate person to respond to the public body and try to achieve what was necessary to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The other difficulty is that a response to the liaison officer would generate an unnecessary amount of work for that officer. This would mean that other important work the liaison officer should do would not be done. It is simply not conducive to clarity to have the public body respond to both. This issue was thought out very carefully. It is adequate to respond to "either or" so that the onus is on one person to act.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">How will the liaison officer know action has not been taken? The Minister of State is making a dog's dinner out of this. Posting a letter is not a significant amount of work. Computers can print off ten copies of a letter and posting a letter to an additional person is not a big deal. The liaison officer is probably the person who will have the most direct contact with the applicant, therefore, it is very important that he or she is informed. An onerous task would be to try to resolve the Third World debt and clean the kitchen floor at the same time. Reading a letter about something with which one is completely familiar is not an onerous task. It is not such a big deal. This is simply a heavy-handed attitude of trying to keep everyone in the dark.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">We are talking about a mainstream service. The intention is that the applicant, following the initial contact, will take responsibility for the relationship with the public body. Naturally, if the applicant does not get a response, he or she can refer to the liaison officer who can be brought back into the loop. It is the most efficient way to operate. It is not a question of keeping anyone in the dark. It is the most conducive way to achieving clarity and results.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">The service statement can be modified and changed as time goes on, depending on the service provided and as resources become available. I assume the liaison officer will be responsible for this work and he or she will have a file on each applicant. He or she will get the assessment report, provide the service statement, liaise with all the public bodies and so on. It is important that the file is completed so that when the liaison officer checks what is happening in regard to John Murphy there will be a complete file and he or she will know what services are being provided, what communication has taken place and if he or she comes back into the loop, he or she will immediately have all the information required and not have to seek it out. This would be much more work than if the information is made available as a matter of course, courtesy and professionalism to the liaison officer who will have a file containing the information. If he or she needs to get back into the loop at some stage — I take the Minister's point that he or she may never need to get back in — if the service statement is to be amended, he or she should have the full information. This would not cost anything extra and would not impose any extra work on the liaison officer but it would mean that the information on the files would be complete. The liaison officer is an important part of this.</p>

It will enable greater efficiency and management of resources, which will be reflected in improved service levels on the ground over time.

          <p eId="para_309">This is a very important and useful set of amendments. In his two amendments the Minister of State has taken on board the spirit of the amendments from this side. Amendment No. 133 would insert the following: "(<i>c</i>) specifying the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports which have not been included in the service statements,”. What is meant by “aggregate needs”? For example if 700 or 800 people in a Health Service Executive region require a particular service such as wheelchairs, would the aggregate in the report specify this kind of matter? Will any provision be made that deals with individual applicants and their unmet needs? I welcome mention of “the periods of time ideally required for the provision of the services, the sequence of such provision and an estimate of the cost of such provision”. While aggregation is important the unmet needs of the persons assessed are equally important. Amendment No. 134 brings this matter down to the level of each individual by mentioning: “identifying the services which are required but which are currently unavailable, resulting in unmet needs of the persons assessed, with a view to making those services available”. This makes a distinction between the individual and the aggregate for an area. However, I welcome the Government amendments, which are quite good.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">This section deals with the service planning of the HSE. Obviously the information contained in the aggregate needs, which will be quantified in monetary terms, will then feed into the new service plan of the HSE. The provision of resources to meet the requirements of the service plan then becomes a budgetary matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I welcome this change and I understand its logic. It is a good way to gather information that could not be available without such a process. While the amendment is good, it is not clear as to whether the Health Service Executive at a regional level will be obliged to address the gap in the service plan for the year or whether it will simply inform the Department and rely on the Department to do so. For example, if speech therapists or psychologists were needed, I do not believe the Health Service Executive at regional level could address that need. It could advertise and get additional money for recruitment but the issue could be the need to get more speech therapists or psychologists qualified.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_312">It will feed into the service planning of the HSE on a national basis. As the service plan deals with work to be carried out in a particular year, the unmet need will not be addressed in the plan. However, the information on the unmet need will obviously be used towards service planning and therefore at national level the HSE will be in a position to establish the total unmet need and the total cost of that unmet need. It then becomes a budgetary issue between the Department of Finance and the HSE as to the amount of money to be made available towards meeting that unmet need. This will then go into the service plan for the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">In respect of Deputy Stanton's question, the aggregate need will be the sum of all the individual needs. I again emphasise that that will be quantified in monetary terms and the estimated cost will be made available six months after the end of the year. The individual needs will not be included in this. In other words no detailed individual needs analysis will be published. Clearly the individual needs will be available and will be known to the executive at a local level. As the Deputy has said this is a significant amendment. This is one of the areas we have agreed to change as a result of the views expressed on Second Stage and by the DLCG. At the end of the year a figure for the unmet needs of the disability sector will be produced and this will feed into the service planning for subsequent years. This is a substantial improvement and will identify for everybody across the spectrum in a very transparent way the unmet needs and the resources needed to address them.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">The Bill provides that the Health Service Executive shall, after six months, submit a report and write to the Minister regarding aggregate needs. Did the Minister of State indicate that this provision relates to the aggregate needs of persons aged over 18 years? The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 covered those aged up to 18 years, whereas this Bill is intended to provide for the educational needs of persons with disabilities aged over 18 years. It emerged during the debate with the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 was the vehicle by which services would be provided for people in second level education until the age of 18 years. It also emerged that people with disabilities often have delayed experiences in school and are frequently obliged to remain in school longer as a result of their disability or impairment. These individuals might be 19 or 20 when they sit their leaving certificate examinations. This means that their education needs are met up to the age of 18 by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 but after that their educational needs must, I presume, be met by this Bill. Will those aggregate needs include educational needs? Such needs could include special needs assistance in school, a personal assistant in school, somebody to assist with transcribing or special computers or other technological aids. If those needs are not met by the service statement, will that kind of educational need be included in the report to be submitted six months after the end of each year?</p>
          <p eId="para_320">People with disabilities who are in sheltered workshops or in training also have special needs. Will their needs also be included in the report? I presume their training and educational needs will come under the scope of the Bill, which deals primarily with health and education. I would like the Minister of State to provide some clarification on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Transport needs are important for people with disabilities, particularly if they live in remote rural areas. Will the HSE take that into account? Will mobility needs, employment needs and occupational needs also be taken into account? I presume that these will be covered by the initial assessment. Social needs are important for everyone. Will the HSE be in a position to liaise with other groups to ensure that a comprehensive report encompassing all needs will be made available? It is not clear how that will be done. There does not appear to be any mechanism for enforcing such an approach.</p>

As Deputy Stanton said, if there are unmet needs in regard to education, how will they be identified? Will the HSE be in a position to state that it will only deal with the health aspects of an assessment? I do not understand how the process will work.

          <p eId="para_332">The logic of what Deputies Lynch and Stanton have pointed out to the Minister of State is that the Health Service Executive can deal with the health aspects of the needs but there are many other aspects. Will, for example, the HSE be able to address all the needs, such as those relating to housing and the other services required? In my view, the HSE will not be able to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The logical conclusion is that a body is required which will be able to do that. That is why the disability legislation consultation group stated that there should be an independent support service which would be able to take on board and collate the required information from a range of service providers, not just those within the health area, and produce a needs assessment that is not limited to a health service or medical model. The health aspects can be dealt with by the Department of Health and Children but what about transport, housing — which comes under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government — and the other areas to which Deputy Stanton referred? There is logic in having an independent disability support service which would encompass all of these areas rather than just one aspect of the needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">I refer the Deputy to section 6(1), which spells out the provision of the education service. In terms of the assessment for people over 18 years, if the assessment includes some educational requirements that will be included in their statement of assessment. Where those services are not met, they will then appear in the category of their unmet needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">When the report is being drawn up, it might be helpful if there was some mechanism whereby the council could liaise with the HSE. I note what the Minister of State said in respect of section 6(3), which confers additional functions on the council and states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_338">(<i>a</i>) to assist health boards in the assessment of adults with disabilities and the preparation of service statements;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_339">(<i>b</i>) to consult with health boards, education service providers and such other persons as the Council considers appropriate for the purposes of facilitating the provision of education services to persons with disabilities in accordance with this Part;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_340">(<i>c</i>) in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science and the health boards, to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education services to adults with disabilities in accordance with this Part;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_341">(<i>d</i>) to assess and review the resources required in relation to educational provision for adults with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">However, the section does not refer to assisting with the aggregate report. Such a reference might be needed just to be sure about this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The fear is that the Health Service Executive, being concerned with health, approaches assessments from a medical angle. One criticism of the Bill is that it is rooted in a medical, rather than social, model of disability. It might be necessary for it to be more broadly rooted and for it to state that the executive shall plan and co-ordinate the provision of education services to adults with disabilities in consultation with the council, as appropriate. This might be helpful. Perhaps the Minister of State will consider it on Report Stage.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_384">In page 16, subsection (1), between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_385">"(<i>a</i>) the denial of a right to an assessment of need;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Section 13(1) states an applicant may, either by himself or herself or through a person referred to in section 8(2), make a complaint to the chief executive officer of the health board concerned regarding certain listed matters. One of these should include the denial of a right to an assessment of need. The Bill should provide a clear right in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The DLCG, in its Equal Citizens document, is adamant about this matter. Although we had this debate yesterday, it is still not clear that there exists a clear right to an assessment of need. It could be based on the availability of personnel or resources. If resources were not being made available to people to carry out an assessment, the HSE could say in September of a given year that its money had been spent and that it could not force the Minister to provide more. It could say it is not allowed to exceed its budget and is not, therefore, in a position to hire anybody to carry out an assessment. Consequently, one could argue that there is no right to an assessment. The applicant would have to wait if this occurred. It is important to allow a complaint to be made if there is a denial of a right to an independent assessment of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Amendment No. 143 requires the insertion of "(<i>b</i>) the contents of the assessment report provided to the applicant;” in page 16, subsection (1), between lines 23 and 24. If one is not happy with the assessment report, one falls at the first fence. I do not know whether there is any redress available if the assessment report is flawed. The Irish Human Rights Commission maintains that a number of gaps in the proposed system of complaints can be identified. It claims there is no explicit or unambiguous means to challenge the contents of an assessment. Perhaps the Minister will address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Amendment No. 145 states "In page 16, subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), line 27, after “contents” to insert “and adequacy”.” This concerns the contents and adequacy of the service statement. The amendment was suggested by ICTU, which is seeking to improve the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of the complaints process. It argues that it is important that the grounds for complaint be extended to include the contents of the assessment report and the adequacy of the service statement provided.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_390">Section 13 gives individuals a right of complaint in certain circumstances, including the fact that the assessment may not have been conducted in accordance with the standards or contents of the service statement. Amendment No. 142 provides, therefore, a further ground for complaint where an assessment has not been completed within the specific timeframe under section 8(5). This new ground of complaint will strengthen the right of the individual to a timely assessment. It will also deal with the issue raised by Deputy Stanton whereby, in practical terms, while there is an independent assessment, it will be predicated on the general resource provision in the Bill. Given, however, that there is a ground for complaint that it must take place in a timely fashion that will be governed by the regulations, the assessment must be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">From a practical point of view, resources should not be an issue in the carrying out of statements of assessment. If we cannot carry out these statements, we will not be able to provide services to any great degree. I am satisfied that there is an independent assessment of need that is strengthened by this additional amendment to put a timeframe on it and a new redress ground if the timeframe is not adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Amendments Nos. 141, 143, 144 and 151 seek to insert further grounds of complaint either where an assessment is denied or arising from the contents of the assessment. I am satisfied the Disability Bill already supports the right to an assessment. Any person who considers he has a disability can apply for an assessment as outlined in section 8(1). Amendment No. 142 strengthens this right by allowing a complaint on the ground I have just outlined. Those qualified for an assessment would, therefore, receive one. In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 141.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The assessment will be independent, carried out without regard to the cost of providing the services identified and in accordance with the standards devised by HIQA. If standards published by HIQA are not complied with, there is a ground for complaint. These standards will relate to the content of the assessment among other things.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Amendments Nos. 146 and 150 seek to include further grounds of complaint on the basis of the inadequacy of the service statement. Section 13(1)(<i>c</i>) already allows an applicant to make a complaint about the contents of the service statement. This could arise from a view that its contents are inadequate, that it does not meet a person’s preferences, that it is factually incorrect or for other reasons. The existing wording is sufficient to cover these varied circumstances, so a separate ground for inadequacy is not required. I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p>

I believe the Ombudsman is a better option and I would like to see it in the Bill because it gives a greater weight to the appeals process. It denies access to the courts, which is provided for in the current appeals mechanism, but the moral weight of the Ombudsman in decision-making is far stronger than any court.

The paragraph states that a complaint may be made “if it be the case, that the assessment under <i>section 8</i> was not conducted in a manner that conforms to the standards determined by a body referred to <i>section 9</i>”. It appears that a person with a disability who has been assessed can appeal every ground other than the fact that the assessment statement is inadequate. He or she could appeal on the grounds that the assessment officer was late, was rude, that there was no access to the building or that it did not take place within a certain timeframe. He or she could appeal on almost every ground except that the assessment statement is not adequate and does not contain what he or she needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">It is a difficulty but it is the case because the service statement is resource-based. That is the critical point on which the Deputy and I must agree to disagree. One can appeal the content of the service statement but one cannot appeal the unmet need between the service statement and the statement of assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The Government's response is the multi-annual investment package being put in place to meet that unmet need by degrees. That is how the Government has chosen to deal with this unmet need. There is no other way to deal with this issue. I have held intensive discussions on this matter with officials in the Department of Finance and they have proved there is no other way to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">This is the only way in which the Department can do this while observing the principle of good governance and carrying out its role effectively. The Department would give the same advice to the Labour Party if it were in Government and it would be very hard to argue against the advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The bona fides of the Government's case are that, parallel with this legislation, which must take cognisance of the principles of good governance, is the strategy to provide the extra resources by degrees to meet those needs. The Deputy criticised the strategy and I appreciate her position but she must understand that is the strategy and the Government is committed to putting the resources in to meet those needs over the course of the multi-annual programme. That is how we intend to provide the services for people with disabilities who do not have them. We have proposed several significant amendments to this Bill to ensure those needs are treated properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I welcome back the Minister of State and wish to comment on amendment No. 143. The Minister of State has correctly pointed out that section 9 of the Bill deals with HIQA carrying out the assessment. Section 9 provides that where an application is made under section 8, the relevant Health Service Executive area shall ensure that the assessment is carried out in a manner which conforms to such standards as may be determined from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Under section 13(1)(<i>b</i>) the applicant can make a complaint about the fact, if it be the case, that the assessment under section 8 was not conducted in a manner that conforms to the standards determined, but there is no provision for making a complaint about the contents of the assessment report itself. The standards seem to deal with the way in which the assessment was carried out but not the end result. If a person is presented with an assessment report which states that he or she has a disability, lists what the assessment found and what should be provided, but that person does not agree with it there does not seem to be a mechanism to make a complaint. This is to be the bedrock on which all else will be based.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">I want to make the same argument I made earlier. It is important that an authority is informed about and deals with a situation where someone is treated badly in an appeals mechanism. The matters most fundamental in this are not included in the service statement, and it is incredible not to have such recourse. I understand the Minister of State's views that the need to build up capacity means resources can be introduced only when it is possible. What if someone knows a service, item, person or facility is available that would make his or her life better but this is not included? There is no mechanism to talk to an authority in that case. This seems too tight to allow for the necessary flexibility. We are talking about people who are entitled to these services. This is not a drain on the Exchequer or a charge on the public purse, it is about ensuring that what is available will be there and that redress will be provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">Yes. I wish the Minister and the DCLG the best of luck in their discussions tomorrow, and it is right that those discussions are ongoing. Has the Ombudsman been approached about taking responsibility for hearing complaints? Has she agreed to take on this role? Will she have an opinion on the restriction on complaints?</p>

          <p eId="para_439">In response to the last question, the Ombudsman's office must be approached about this, but the intention would be to establish a new division within the office to deal with the complaints procedure and to provide the necessary resources. I am advised that the Ombudsman's office has no difficulty with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The ability of somebody to appeal or complain in the situation Deputy Lynch outlined is catered for in the Bill. A person can appeal the contents of the service statement to the complaints officer and can make the case that other services were not taken into account. As it stands, that can be investigated by the complaints officer or the appeals officer.</p>

The insurance point for all applicants is that everybody will work to the same set of standards, which will be outlined and agreed.

The needs of people with disabilities will change just as our needs change and, in some cases, they will have greater difficulties than the rest of us. Providing for a time limit for complaints in this fashion is overly prescriptive and overly bureaucratic. At the end of the day, this will not result in a charge on the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Flexibility should be provided in the complaints procedure in terms of time for the person involved. It is all right for the rest of us.

          <p eId="para_546">Section 13(2) provides that a complaint must be made within timeframes to be specified in regulations under section 20. The amendment would mean there would be no time limit for making a complaint. Deletion of this provision would create an unacceptable situation where complaints might fall to be processed a long time after the HSE or education service provider has dealt with the matter in question. It would also have knock on effects for the appeals process. Section 13(2) states, "A complaint under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be made by the applicant concerned or a person referred to in <i>section 8(2) </i>as soon as reasonably may be after the cause of the complaint has arisen and in any case within such time (if any) as may be prescribed under <i>section 20</i>”.

          <p eId="para_562">On amendment No. 158, there does not seem to be any timeframe within which the Health Service Executive must refer a complaint to the complaints officer. A complaint could be made to the HSE and possibly go from desk to desk, from office to office, from person to person, with no timeframe within which it must be passed on to the complaints officer. In theory it is possible that a complaint could languish in the offices of an executive for a month or six weeks or six months. There is no requirement in the legislation for the chief executive officer to pass it on. It does not even stipulate this should be within a reasonable timeframe or immediately or any other length of time. We suggest as soon as a complaint is received or within a maximum of five working days, it should be passed on. This is important because the complaints officer is independent in the performance of his or her functions and rightly so, but the complaints officer cannot act until he or she receives the complaint. The Bill states the CEO shall refer the complaint but it does not state how soon or when this will happen.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_563">I refer to amendment No. 162. Section 13(5) allows the option of informal resolution of a complaint by the complaints officer where this is feasible. Amendment No. 162 is designed to cover the eventuality where this process breaks down, by requiring that the complaint is passed to a different complaints officer for formal investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I note that amendment No. 163 is quite similar to amendment No. 162, save that it specifies timeframes. I agree that in such cases it would be inappropriate and unfair to the applicant if his or her case was to be investigated by the same officer but cannot accept this proposal for a timeframe. I will return to this matter in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">It is interesting to note the varied timeframes sought for aspects of the complaints process in amendments Nos. 156 to 158, inclusive, 160, 163, 164 and 169, which range from within five days to a month to the general provision of a "specified timeframe". The variations expose the difficulty of pinning down a timeframe to suit everybody. Section 20 already allows for regulations to determine timescales for this process and I am satisfied this presents a more practical approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Amendments Nos. 160 and 163 seek to ensure that informal resolution of complaints will be concluded within one month. Setting such a stringent timescale could be detrimental to finding an effective and workable solution for the parties concerned, particularly in more complex cases. It could encourage a quick fix solution instead of achieving the best solution in the interest of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Amendments Nos. 169, 175 and 179 seek to require the complaints officer to make recommendations to specify a timescale for the implementation of their recommendations. The timescales for implementation of recommendations on assessments and preparation of service statements are already determined in sections 8 and 10. On the provision of a service, the service statement and if not delivered, the insertion of a time frame for delivery of the service, may give a non-compliant service provider extra time, to which he or she is not entitled under the section as published, during which he or she may continue to fail to provide the service concerned. In addition there could be a number of services in a service statement in relation to which different timeframes for delivery apply. I therefore do not propose to accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I note the arguments put forward by the Deputies. I am prepared to concede on amendment No. 157. I note the argument for a reasonable period of time and I am prepared to consider it as a possible amendment to be governed by the regulations. I will return to it on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_645">Many quasi-judicial procedures, as the Minister of State described them, are held in public. There is a concern that hearings on certain matters, particularly proceedings involving children in the family courts, are held in private. This issue was brought to our attention by Down Syndrome Ireland which requested that in certain — probably rare — cases it may be correct and proper to give an applicant the freedom to waive his or her right to a private, <i> in camera</i> hearing. Under the Bill, such persons would have no such right and all proceedings would be held behind closed doors. The amendment proposes to give people the freedom to have such rare cases heard in public.

I am fully aware of concerns expressed by many groups about the complexity and bureaucracy of the complaints process. Amendment No. 181 provides for the deletion of subsections(11), (12) and (13) and thereby removes a layer from the complaints process with a view to simplifying the system by making it more efficient and user-friendly. I note the look of disbelief on Deputy Lynch's face.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Amendment No. 195 provides that the executive and education service provider can appeal the complaints officer's recommendations directly to the independent appeals officer where the provision of a service is at issue. The appeal will give the chief executive officer a right to be heard by the complaints officer in substitute for the right formally contained in subsections (11) and (13) which I propose to delete. Amendment No. 212 is consequential on amendment No. 181 and inserts the CEO into the mediation process. Amendment No. 195 will also make the process more accessible by allowing an appeal to be made in writing or in a form to the like effect. I note Deputy Finian McGrath's amendment No. 198 also has the same proposal which arises from a suggestion from the National Disability Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Section 17(1) sets out the grounds for appeal by individuals regarding findings and recommendations by the complaints officer.

          <p eId="para_659">Amendments Nos. 196 and 197 seek to extend the timescale for making an appeal from six weeks to six months.

          <p eId="para_660">Amendment No. 199 refers to a longer period for appeals in some cases.

          <p eId="para_671">My amendments are Nos. 196 and 197. Again, it was brought to our attention by a number of the groups that "weeks" should be changed to "months". It could happen for all kinds of reasons that people would not have the capacity to initiate an appeal in a six-week period. We should remember that we are dealing with people with disabilities. Illness could also be the cause of a delay in submitting an appeal. If a person has a mental illness, he or she may not be able to initiate an appeal. The reason we proposed to extend the period in which an appeal could be submitted was to give such people an opportunity to make an appeal. As it stands, appeals must be lodged in writing within six weeks of the decision to which they refer. Access to the appeals mechanism could be denied to a person who lacked the capacity to initiate an appeal during the six weeks following a decision, which might constitute a practical obstacle to the remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">We are seeking a more liberal and flexible approach to the time limit. It should not make a great difference whether it is six weeks or six months, except that the former limits the window of opportunity and, in effect, could result in a person with a disability being told he or she had missed the boat. An appeal could still be made within four or six weeks of a decision being made but changing the time period would offer more flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">We should remember that we are dealing with people with special needs. The two organisations that brought this to my attention were Schizophrenia Ireland and Down Syndrome Ireland which was very concerned about this issue. I am sure I do not have to elaborate as to how the former might be concerned. There would not be any cost implications for the Department as no extra cost would be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The intention of the amendment is to introduce flexibility to facilitate people. It is an attempt to take a humane approach to people's needs. A person could be out of action for six weeks and might not be in a position to make an appeal. I do not see why the Minister of State is holding firm on his position. It would be an easy amendment to accept or at least to consider. It may be the case that six months is too long a period but six weeks is a very short period, especially for somebody with a disability who may not be in a position to make an appeal due to illness.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">I accept the thrust of what the Deputy says. However, if a person is not in a position to appeal him or herself, he or she can have the assistance of an advocate. The time limit for appeal in this legislation is much more generous than in the District Court where the period of appeal is much shorter. The difficulty with a long appeal period is that it complicates the system and causes delay. However, I take the point that there may be exceptional circumstances. I am disposed towards reviewing the possibility of giving the complaints officer some latitude to take late appeals in exceptional circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">There have been some substantial improvements to the legislation and I am glad that we, the Opposition, were able to agree with the Minister of State. He does not agree with us very often but we are very compliant and agreeable on this side.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Before the complaints officers are appointed, will the qualifications and expertise they require be laid down? Maybe I am missing the point but the legislation does not seem to suggest the complaints officer shall have a certain amount of experience. It appears that any employee of the Health Service Executive can be chosen as a complaints officer. It would be useful if there were some criteria determining the experience and qualifications a complaints officer requires. Will the role of a complaints officer be exclusively that of complaints officer in the executive or will he or she have another job? It is important to gain some understanding of the Minister of State's thinking on complaints officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Will the complaints officer work on his or her own or will he or she have staff? Will a complaints officer be appointed as each case arises and will this person have an office and staff in the Health Service Executive? The Bill states that complaints officers may be authorised but how will this operate in practice? If this is a secondary role, it is important those investigating complaints have experience and back up resources.</p>

Will at least 3% of the positions be for those with disabilities and will people with disabilities be able to apply for every post? I hope there will not be many complaints because with the provision of resources following the budget, that should not be the case. It is important, however, that there are quality people to deal with complaints and that those with disabilities should be encouraged to apply for these jobs.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">This concerns the independence of the appeals mechanism. We do not know if it is possible to make the amendment because there are difficulties discussing the issue. If the Minister of State will not have the Ombudsman as the appeals mechanism as his own preferred choice, I am uncertain if it is of benefit to discuss this. I feel, however, that the Ombudsman's office should be the mechanism we use. It is well respected and has a reputation that is second to none. It would do an extremely good job. Whether it is agreeable to that is anyone's guess because no one has written or spoken to it. The Minister of State said if the Office of the Ombudsman is involved there will be a separate unit within that office to deal with these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">That could be a useful resource for people with disabilities, not just for dealing with complaints. It would be foolish to restrict it to the complaints function. The Ombudsman's annual report is a useful tool and source of information. This could serve the same purpose. We lack information about people with disabilities, their numbers, range of disabilities and needs. I will discuss this issue as if I were trying to persuade the Minister of State, but at the back of my mind I know the true situation. That is a difficult position to be in. The Minister of State should accept this amendment which he said is his preference.</p>

          <p eId="para_709">On the broader issue of an officer appointed by the Ombudsman and accountable to him or her, the public and those working with, and families of, people with disabilities have confidence in the Ombudsman's reports. They would also have confidence in an officer accountable to him or her. It is important to highlight this trust.

Will the Ombudsman, on receipt of a complaint, have the right to contact the executive involved and demand that the problem be rectified? Will the complaint to the Ombudsman be open-ended in the same way as it is if I lodge a complaint about the Department of Health and Children or whatever? Is the mechanism which the Minister of State plans to put in place the same as that involving a complaints officer, namely, that the complaint is confined to the process, as opposed to the content?</p>

          <p eId="para_760">This amendment aims to introduce an element of ownership for those with disabilities. It proposes for oral hearings to an appeal to be given when requested by the applicant. The Minister of State should have no objection to this as most hearings are held orally. If a person with a disability is allowed to bring an assistant or a person to act on his or her behalf, the hearings will probably be held orally. I deal with many social welfare appeals, many of which are oral, and I find them far more satisfactory as the discourse is more interactive.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">If an individual is allowed to have an oral hearing as opposed to writing out an appeal, it gives a sense of ownership to the process. It will not cost more as a whole system is in place for it. Oral hearings will leave a more satisfied client than if the process was deliberately restricted or only the appeals officer was allowed to determine it. If I were an appeals officer, I would not want to have oral hearings, much preferring to deal with matters in written format as it is easier and less confrontational. However, for the client, oral hearings make more sense, making him or her feel much better about the process — how people feel about the process is as important as how the process is operated.</p>

Oral appeals, as opposed to the written format, also convince those listening to the case. During the committee's hearings on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the victims' families told members that by being able to tell their stories, while not taking away the hurt and damage done, they appreciated people were listening to them.</p>

This goes a long way towards ensuring the needs of the applicant are given due regard. The overriding issue is that the appeals officer or the Ombudsman has statutory responsibility for the appeals process and must clearly be in charge of its determination.

          <p eId="para_774">This is probably one of the critical areas of the legislation. I am not suggesting it is pivotal, but to define it as perjury is wrong. I deal with these oral hearings regularly and one can ask any of the appeals officers in the Department of Social and Family Affairs to confirm what I say. I have never attended a hearing at which someone has been asked to swear an oath, or affirm, in whatever way. It is not that type of hearing. I have no difficulty with it being an offence to give false evidence or to say something which one knows not to be true, but to define it as perjury is wrong.</p>

One is dealing with people who are probably going into oral hearings with great trepidation. I have seen grown men unable to speak at hearings. Such cases are very tense, and people do not want to be involved in them. People are going in to make their cases with this threat hanging over them. If the Minister of State is defining this as perjury, the officer must say so at the outset in the same manner as the Chairman of this committee must warn people from outside that they do not have privilege, while we do. People will have to be warned in advance about perjury. I accept that giving false evidence at a hearing is an offence, but not perjury.

          <p eId="para_795">This amendment is again about judicial remedy. I know this is not the direction the Minister of State wants to take, but if he looks seriously at the amendment he will see that it is not the type of amendment that leads us to the High Court or the Supreme Court, or to the type of case he is so worried about. The District Court is the softer option. I have no doubt that the Minister of State will reject the amendment and at this hour of the night I am not even certain I have the energy to argue with him. However, it is important that people feel they have means of redress. I have made this argument perhaps ten times today with regard to different sections. People need to feel they have some means of redress and that some independent assessor, in this case a judge, would make the decision. I would be fearful of saying the District Court is cheap, but it is an inexpensive way of getting a judgment or decision on certain matters.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_874">There are many mechanisms in the Bill as regards assessment, service, complaints, appeals, the Ombudsman and so on. It is structured so that there are mechanisms in place to obviate the need for people to go to court. That is the way it is being set up. All these other mechanisms may be used along the way. The likelihood is that if somebody uses all these mechanisms, which do not exist at the moment, he or she will probably find that the case will be dealt with satisfactorily, one way or another. The number of cases to emerge, ultimately, that will still require some resolution will probably be very small. Members of the disability community always make the point that the last place they want to be is in court. Nobody wants to be there, it is a last resort, but this section removes that last resort. In effect, it bars that last resort from the citizen, bearing in mind all the other mechanisms that are built into the legislation to allow redress appeal and so on; and bearing in mind that the number of cases that might end up in court, if the system works, will be extremely small. It might be only test cases that are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">From that viewpoint I am puzzled as to why this section is necessary. If the Bill is as good as the Minister of State says it is, and which we hope it will be, why is it necessary to have this final belt, braces and hand grenade at the end of it so that people cannot opt for the courts, as they do at present? They are used all the time because the other mechanisms, as such, are not in place. We are putting these mechanisms in place, while also saying that one cannot go into court. The logic is, if the mechanisms and the legislation are to work as envisaged, there is no need to go to court, except in very rare cases, extremely small in number. In that regard this section is superfluous and should not be there. That is why we are opposing it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fahey</from>
          <p eId="para_876">That is the reason I favour the change-over to the Ombudsman and the limited access to the courts in this case is of little consequence. That is one of the reasons I proposed the Ombudsman as an alternative to this appeals procedure, with the mechanism of an appeal on a point of law to the court.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_878">Not really. We have all tabled amendments that bring the Ombudsman into the process. The Minister has not done this yet, as such, but is talking about doing so. We have tabled amendments to bring the Ombudsman in, prior to section 19 coming into vogue, and specifically to ensure that he or she acts as a final filter or appeal mechanism before going into court, which nobody wants. If the Ombudsman is to act as a final court of appeal, the vast majority of cases will stop at that point. Perhaps one or two will still require a judicial review. An attempt is being made here to try to stop that.</p>
