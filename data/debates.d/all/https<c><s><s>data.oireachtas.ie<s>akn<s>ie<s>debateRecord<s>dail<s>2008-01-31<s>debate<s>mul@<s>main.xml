          <p eId="para_4">The House will have seen the tragic case of the Ó Cuanacháin family who now face a legal bill of €5 million following their attempt to pursue the rights of their child through the courts.  Eight years on after the idea of a Bill to provide education provision based on the needs of an individual was introduced in the Dáil, we still do not have an appeals mechanisms through which parents who feel their needs are not met by the Department can appeal without going to the courts.  How can a Government stand over a situation where no appeals mechanism is in place which can be utilised by families?</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Yesterday, the outgoing Taoiseach indicated that a Bill being introduced to the House should have two weeks before it is debated on Second Stage.  The would-be incoming Taoiseach is telling us that we will have two working days before the Finance Bill is to be considered by the House.  Is that an indication that the Bill is so light that we do not need to give it serious consideration?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a succession of announcements of job losses.  This week 330 jobs were lost at Allergan in Arklow, County Wicklow.  Before that 220 jobs went at Jacobs Fruitfield, 60 at Britvic in Cork and 400 at the Burlington Hotel.  Up to 1,500 jobs are under threat at SR Technics.  Construction employment is down by 5.4% with 15,000 more on the live register than this time last year.  Yesterday, some economic expert predicted unemployment will reach 6% by the end of this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The Tánaiste will recall that the Ethics in Public Office Bill was announced in October 2006 by the Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste, Mr. Michael McDowell, following the revelations about the Taoiseach's finances at that time.  The Bill provided for an arrangement whereby if a Member of the Oireachtas were to get a gift or a loan he or she would seek an opinion from the Standards in Public Office Commission before accepting it.  The Bill completed all Stages in the Seanad on 4 July, but it was never presented to this House.  The Bill is sponsored by the Tánaiste's Department.  In the absence of other legislation this week I was surprised that the Bill was not presented to the House.  When does the Tánaiste intend to take Second Stage of that Bill in this House?</p>

He could not go to the Central Mental Hospital because people could not be discharged from the hospital owing to a problem with the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 whereby there is no mechanism for people who are released under supervision to return if that becomes necessary.  Therefore there is a problem getting people into the Central Mental Hospital.  Does the Government intend to amend the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 to address this human rights issue?</p>

Keeping in mind what happened in the courts this week and the report which was given to the Minister for Education and Science in October 2006 which recommended the mechanism for appeals but which still has not been introduced, I ask the Tánaiste to speak to the Minister for Education and Science and ask her to at least read the report and to implement the recommendations.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">That is the first point.  The fact that reports issue recommendations and Ministers do not act upon them does not mean the Ministers are at fault in any way.  We may not agree with the recommendations and there may be other ways of dealing with the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The Department of Education and Science has developed policy in this area in recent years.  It has been having a great degree of success in many respects in mainstreaming people with disabilities into the education system.  Significant resources are being applied and thousands of people are being employed in the education system.  We have moved from a very poor situation to one which has greatly improved and is much to the credit of this Minister and of previous Ministers who have taken up this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">I know parents have had specific views about the type of education they believe would be most appropriate for their children.  However, education policy is decided by the Department while listening to all those concerns but not necessarily agreeing in total with views however well motivated and well-intentioned with regard to the interests of their children.  This is the problem which the Government has been grappling with in the interests of the best educational needs of those children.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">Deputy Hanafin has a very good record in this area.  The question of how this type of education is applied within the mainstream is the real challenge.  There is a continuing debate with interested groups about specialist schools which are separate from mainstream schooling.  I am particularly acquainted with this debate since I regularly speak to parents in my constituency about these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The fact that specific recommendations are made does not mean that the Minister is not working on this matter or is not coming up with results and improvements which may not exactly equate with what certain people believe is the right way but I reiterate that significant improvements are being made.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_102">Sinn Féin's approach to the issues raised by this motion is based on our own analysis and our own politics.  It was put to me by a journalist this week that Sinn Féin was out of line with the other two Opposition parties in not concentrating all our fire on the Taoiseach over his lack of credibility at the tribunal.  We were accused of clouding the issue by introducing all the areas of public policy on which this Taoiseach and this Government have been responsible for monumental failures.  I make no apology for our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">This Taoiseach should go because he has presided over a decade of government which has seen deepening inequality in our society, the squandering of economic prosperity, the downgrading and privatisation of public services, atrocious planning and delivery in housing and infrastructure and above all, the ongoing chaos in our grossly inequitable and inefficient health services.  These are the reasons the Taoiseach should step down.  In my mind they far exceed in importance the Taoiseach's financial affairs and his engagement at the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The Taoiseach's ability to deal with these issues and with the day-to-day affairs of Government is now deeply undermined by the mess in which he finds himself.  The Taoiseach has failed to convince people with his account of his personal and constituency finances.  He has made contradictory statements and produced convoluted explanations that stretch credibility to the limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Sinn Féin endorses the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Deputies reiterating support for the Mahon tribunal.  We reject the Government amendment principally because it includes full support for the Tribunal of Inquiries Bill 2005 which would give far too much power to Ministers to control future tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">We now have a serving Taoiseach at odds with the Revenue Commissioners, as he had to admit here in the Dáil yesterday.  I question who advised him that Revenue would not be able to settle his tax affairs until the conclusion of the Mahon tribunal.  Did anyone do so or was this another convenient way to deflect questions about his tax compliance?  We also have a serving Taoiseach who cannot provide a tax clearance certificate.  This was the Taoiseach who claimed last year that he was fully tax compliant.  It was clear from the correspondence between the Taoiseach and the Revenue Commissioners that they were not and are not satisfied that he is tax compliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Last night the Taoiseach's spokesperson responded to the news that the Taoiseach had assisted Manchester businessman, Norman Turner, with a passport application.  It was stated that all TDs assist people with passport applications and so we do but how many of us have provided such assistance to wealthy business people who also happen to be major donors to our parties and who also happen to be seeking political and planning support for multi-million euro projects such as casinos and conference centres?  Only one party and only one TD fits the bill in that case and that is Fianna Fáil and Deputy Bertie Ahern.  It should be noted that the Taoiseach's spokespersons have not felt it necessary to defend the acceptance by Des Richardson on behalf of Fianna Fáil of a donation of $10,000 from Norman Turner at the time he was trying to advance his casino plan.  Most citizens would rightly regard the acceptance of such money in such circumstances as deeply unethical, but of course it was perfectly legal, so the Taoiseach and his party feel no need to defend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Government managed at the last minute to produce an amendment to the Private Members' motion but that amendment cannot hide the contradictions within this strange patchwork of an Administration.  We have seen the two members of the Progressive Democrats in the Dáil split down the middle with Deputy Noel Grealish attacking the Mahon tribunal and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, defending it.  We have seen the Green Party stopping short of expressing full confidence in the Taoiseach while clinging steadfastly to its Cabinet seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">In putting its name to the Government amendment, the Green Party is endorsing the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005, a position I did not believe it held.  Reform of tribunals is very necessary, especially in regard to exorbitant costs, but this Bill would effectively give the Government the power to suspend or dissolve a tribunal for unlimited reasons and to prevent the publication of a tribunal's report.  This is completely unacceptable and will further undermine public trust and confidence in the political system.  The Green Party's claimed support for tribunals and for ethics in public life is undermined by its endorsement of this flawed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I have described this as a strange Government.  Its programme for Government was sneaked out rather than launched.  The leaders of the three parties in Government, if the Progressive Democrats can still be given that status, have never to my knowledge stood together for a photo call or press conference.  If the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats truly believed they were in a partnership Government in which Deputy Bertie Ahern should remain as Taoiseach they would surely be clamouring, as others have done in the past, to be seen at his side at every opportunity.  Of course they will not do so because they want to have it both ways.  Understandably, they want to remain in Government while distancing themselves from the troubles of the Taoiseach.  They want to shirk their collective responsibility for the ongoing and deep-seated policy failures of a Fianna Fáil-dominated Government, heavily influenced by Progressive Democrats ideology, but they all bear collective responsibility for the disasters of this Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">This is only the last day of January but already this year we have had a succession of reminders of the disastrous state of our health service.  These include the study showing slower access to cancer services for public patients than for private patients, worsening waiting times in accident and emergency departments and longer waiting lists for outpatient treatment, a tightened Health Service Executive embargo on recruitment in the health service, the HSE's refusal to fund the essential increase in GP training places, no increase this year in funding for mental health services and the advancement of the notorious co-location scheme.  On top of all this, we have had cuts in hospital services around the country and more are planned in the north east in my area, with other regions to follow.  In the north east, services at all hospitals are to be cut under a draft plan revealed this week.  Let us make no mistake about it, these cuts have more to do with bookkeeping than life saving.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I referred at the beginning of my contribution to the journalist who challenged Sinn Féin on our position on the Taoiseach's engagement with the tribunal.  The journalist said the electorate had made its judgment on the policy issues at the general election.  That is not so, as I told him on that occasion outside the gates of this House.  At that time, people voted for a Taoiseach whom they understood was and would be tax compliant.  They did not vote for water charges for schools.  They did not vote for growing job losses.  They did not vote for parents of autistic children being bankrupted by the State because they fought in court for the right to education which had been denied to their special child.  They did not vote for another two-year wait for basic facilities for people with cystic fibrosis and they certainly did not vote for cuts in health services that are a throwback to the savage cuts of the 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I am inclined to draw an analogy here.  The average voter now is like a diner who is starting to regret what he ordered in the restaurant.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats stew with Green side salad has arrived, but it does not smell right and the voter-diner knows he made a bad choice.  It is now time to send back the meal, bring in the health inspector and to have the whole damn place closed down.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I am happy to support amendment No. l moved by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in the House last night.  The motion is consistent with the support the Green Party has always shown for the tribunal of inquiry into planning matters, from 7 October 1997 to this day.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The tribunal of inquiry is a necessary legal mechanism to investigate the barrage of strange, unjustifiable and bad planning decisions in Dublin and beyond which have afflicted the development of this country.  Political decisions, influenced by the interests of a small cabal of property owners and developers, often resulted in frenzies of rezoning which have set back parts of Ireland by decades.  In order to have confidence in the planning system, the truths about the lack of planning in the past must be systematically and judiciously unearthed.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">This debate should also serve as a reminder of the need to prevent the incidents we now know about from happening again.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, will deliver on his promise to reform local government so that the public will have confidence in planning.  I trust all parties will support such reforms aimed at bringing transparency and responsiveness to local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">As for the Opposition, which has so energetically talked about this debate throughout the whole Christmas recess, I categorically reject the Leader of the Opposition's claims of absent Green Party Members and roll-overs.  We were in the House last night for the debate; my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has presented the House with a motion of unconditional support for the tribunal.  If this debate is not just a cheap political stunt, then the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party should now put their voting intentions where their mouths are and support the Government motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">They have confidence in the tribunal, as the motion states; they accept the rulings of the Supreme Court in regard to the tribunal, as the motion states; they urge the tribunal to continue its work speedily, as the motion states; and they support future tribunals enjoying the confidence of the public, as the motion states.  They<b> </b>were the ones who initiated this debate about investigating planning matters so they should welcome this discussion and, although some Opposition Members may have known about imminent tribunal leaks and did nothing about it, the Opposition ought to condemn legal leaks and breaches of confidentiality and defend the right to confidentiality of citizens in correspondence with the tribunal.  There is nothing in the Government motion they cannot accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">As for the Labour Party, its Deputies should take note of what its current leader said in the House during the debate on establishing the tribunal in October 1997: "The political arena is not the place to judge anyone's guilt or innocence, as those words are not the currency of politics."  Let them support the motion, let the tribunal get on with its work and let us get on with the work we were elected to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I welcome the opportunity to support amendment No. 1, as colleagues on this side of the House are doing.  One aspect of that amendment refers to the opportunity to discuss the procedures and practices involved in investigating matters mandated by Oireachtas Éireann.  This is a fundamental element of the entire debate, namely, the right to comment.  If one were to judge by some of the statements coming from the Opposition benches, one of the rights which it is proposed to circumscribe is the right of people on this side to hold an opinion or to express it.  It is a fundamental right and one that any of us who values human dignity or human rights would certainly defend.  The fundamental question to which members of the tribunal would seek an answer from this House is exactly what the Oireachtas requires and expects of it.  The original motion setting up the tribunal set that very clearly and unequivocally.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Unfortunately, in the interim, there were occasions when that mandate was not observed in the manner that it ought to have been.  Are Members suggesting that during those times people who had reservations about the rights of citizens and how they were dealt with ought to have remained silent?  Even if they were, they certainly have the findings of the High Court and the Supreme Court to rely on if they wished to have something to validate their concerns.  One of the statements of an eminent judge was to the effect that the tribunal was established in 1997.  Some of us who have been here prior to that time and who have seen the Oireachtas quite rightly set up a number of tribunals tend to forget how long it is since this particular tribunal was set up.  I doubt if any Member of either House in 1997 anticipated that this tribunal would still be sitting 11 years later and, apparently, it is not much nearer to reaching the conclusions that it was mandated to reach.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_97" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_126">The judge rightly stated that the tribunal was established in 1997 and that the concept behind the tribunal is that there be an inquiry into definite matters as a matter of urgent public importance.  The fact that the tribunal is still inquiring ten years later is the antithesis of an urgent public inquiry.  There are all kinds of reasons for that, but fundamental to it is the requirement of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">There are people here and in the other House who, from what they have stated, require of the tribunal heads on plates.  They do not really require or expect — certainly they do not want — facts, findings and recommendations as set out by the Oireachtas.  Ultimately, that is what the Oireachtas charged this tribunal with doing.  The Oireachtas, as the body which set it up, has every right — in my view, every duty — to comment on how it is done, but it is of course entirely unjust if Members of the Government are accused of undermining the tribunal when people equally undermine the tribunal by setting out a stall which clearly demands of it findings of fact which advance a particular political perspective.  That is something that this House, and no Member of it, is entitled to demand or expect.  It is a fundamental question and one to which we all are obliged to face up.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">No doubt there are concerns in the public arena about issues such as cost, there are concerns about issues related to the treatment of people and there are all kinds of other ancillary issues.  Ultimately, the long-term goal of this inquiry is relatively narrow and relatively straightforward, and it is perfectly reasonable to hold the view that what it was set up to do is what this Parliament requires it to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">When one sees muddying of the waters with issues about passports — I, like most Members, have assisted people in getting passports — dragged in, one inevitably makes the judgment that the tribunal issue is part of another political agenda.  There is no fundamental issue with parties and people having political agendas, but when they pretend and seek to put them in the respectable context of a tribunal and they are merely political point-scoring, of course they are open to being criticised on that front.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The point made by Deputy Mary White and many others is of singular importance.  The key point she made is that no Member of the Oireachtas, who is interested and committed to this tribunal or, indeed, any tribunal doing the job that it was set up to do, could object to any element of the Government amendment.  I would say that they would be duty bound to go with the terms of the amendment in the width and depth of what is required of the tribunal and in the expectation, rightly, of this Parliament that the job that it was set up to do is the one that it does.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterPowerFF" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Deputy Peter Power</from>
          <p eId="para_131">I thank my colleagues for sharing time.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">In advance of this debate Fine Gael spokespersons were at pains to suggest that this motion is in direct response to criticism of the tribunal by members of the Government, as if to imply that criticism of the methodology and functioning of the tribunal in some way equates with sleaze or planning corruption.  Indeed, this was one of the central planks of the contributions of Deputies Kenny and Varadkar last night and this is a contention which I reject out of hand as a myth.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">There is no institution of this State which has immunity from accountability to this House.  It is my conviction that Members of this House have not alone a right but a positive duty to hold any organ of State, this or any other tribunal, to account.  We have a positive duty and a right to do that by virtue of our membership of this House, by virtue of our democratic mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The Opposition which tabled this motion would do well to remember that the tribunal is an instrument of this House and it operates under terms of reference set down by this House.  It reports to this House and it functions under legislation enacted in this House.  It is a ludicrous proposition to suggest, as this motion does, that we are not allowed to hold that tribunal to account, and I reject it.  It is an abdication of political responsibility and political accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Let us be absolutely clear on this point.  We, as Members of this House, have a right and a duty to hold the tribunal to account, but what we do not have, what no Member has, is the right to compromise the independence of the tribunal by placing ourselves in the place of the judges of the tribunal and predetermining the outcome of the tribunal.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what many members of Fine Gael are guilty of.  They have placed themselves in the place of the judges of the tribunal.  By resolution of this House we delegated fact-finding functions of this House to the judges of the tribunal.  We did not delegate those functions to Deputy Varadkar or Senator Regan, we delegated those fact-finding functions to the judges of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">On 20 December, outside the gates of this House on national television, Deputy Varadkar declared no less than that the Taoiseach's evidence on that particular day was demolished by counsel for the tribunal, and only last night, again in a clear abuse of Dáil privilege, he took it upon himself to predict with great certainty what the outcome of the tribunal would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I ask this question, not alone of Deputy Varadkar but also of members of Fine Gael opposite, how can they possibly put their names to a motion which calls for the independence of a tribunal from this House when, by their own words and public pronouncements, it is the very antithesis of independence?  It is a contradiction and a hypocrisy and if they do not see it, it is the height of arrogance.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">I had to apologise to the Joint Committee on Education and Science, of which I am Chairman, for leaving it to come here, but I felt it was important to comment on this issue.  I reiterate the Green Party's absolute confidence in the Mahon tribunal.  I come from a constituency that is very much the focus of the workings of the tribunal, which has alleged, and in some cases demonstrated, corrupt practices by councillors from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  If an Opposition party wants to cast aspersions, it should at least start from the position of being on high moral ground.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  To my mind, the only person with any real morality in a leadership position in Fine Gael over the past number of years is Deputy Michael Noonan, because, at some cost to Fine Gael's electoral prospects, he abolished corporate donations within the party.  He said Fine Gael would not take corporate donations.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Unfortunately, this was reversed.  The coffers of Fine Gael have grown once again.  As Members know, the Green Party does not take such donations.  It is always in the halfpenny place when trying to compete with Fine Gael on the ground.  That is unfortunate, but it is the way things stand.  If Fine Gael wants to convince the larger parties, be it Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party, which takes generous trade union donations, that this is not the way to go and that political decisions must be seen to be taken without a hint of influence, it should, as the main Opposition party, show leadership, abolish corporate donations and fight with one hand tied behind its back as the Green Party does at election time.</p>

The plan for Clonburris was passed recently by members of South Dublin County Council.  When the Leader of the Seanad, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, heard it was passed she said the campaign against Clonburris was not yet over, that we still had An Bord Pleanála.  She said in the Lucan newsletter that Fine Gael had launched a first appeal against the Clonburris strategic development zone.  However, the two Fine Gael councillors at the meeting voted for the development plans.  The Senator said one thing, but the councillors said something else.  If that is not hypocrisy, or at least stupidity, I do not know what is.</p>

Let us not get caught up in obsessing over every nuance of what the tribunal is doing.  Instead, let us take a step back and examine the reasons for its establishment in the first place.

          <p eId="para_259">It is important to remind the House of the wording of the Fine Gael motion given the comments of previous speakers.  It states: "That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Mahon tribunal, and its belief that the tribunal is acting independently, without bias and within the remit contained in the terms of reference set by the Oireachtas."  One would have a right to assume that this should not be a contentious motion.  In truth, it probably would not have been in any period over the last ten years until now, when the Taoiseach is giving evidence and must answer straight questions about his financial affairs in the mid-1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">People have correctly asked why Dáil Éireann is spending its first week of the 2008 session debating the Mahon tribunal and not addressing issues that affect people's everyday lives.  God knows there are plenty of such issues at present.  However, this motion is necessary because of a concerted effort by a series of Government Ministers to undermine and discredit the work of the tribunal.  They were marched out before Christmas to express a phony outrage at how the Mahon tribunal was conducting its business.  They included our most powerful and experienced politicians.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said he was astounded by what the tribunal was doing.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Séamus Brennan, supported him and complained of a lack of fairness.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, accused the tribunal lawyers of being petty, personal and provocative and of asking questions that were quite unacceptable.  He referred to unfair procedures that were unacceptable in civilised society, appalling treatment and accused the tribunal of badgering the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was almost embarrassed by some of the comments of his colleagues.  I have some admiration for him for having the courage to say that he believed his colleagues were motivated by political loyalty.  That is the Fianna Fáil world — political loyalty above all else and as long as they are not caught, they can do as they wish.  These were not random, unco-ordinated responses by individuals with a genuine concern for fairness or balance.  This was a co-ordinated effort organised by the Government press secretary, whose function is to be a spokesperson for the Taoiseach, to divert attention away from the detail of the Taoiseach's evidence to the tribunal and to focus attention on the functioning and other aspects of tribunal activity, such as the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The political motivation was clear.  Everybody in Government was uncomfortable discussing the Taoiseach's explanations for the origin of private donations to him in the 1990s.  That was understandable.  The strategy was, therefore, that attack was the best form of defence.  The whispering campaign around Leinster House was that it was all the tribunal's fault, overpaid lawyers were being paid a fortune in taxpayers' money, the tribunal was too expensive, it should move more quickly and it no longer represented value for money.  It was suggested that it might be time to shut it down and end the costly circus once and for all.  We heard the same last night from the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea.  He said he and others were raising legitimate questions.  It is no coincidence that he happened to be raising legitimate questions at the same time that tribunal lawyers were asking legitimate questions of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and questioning the credibility of his evidence to the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">People are sick of this type of politics: the cute hoorism, diversionary tactics to divert attention away from finding the truth and the politics of party loyalty over-riding what is in the public interest.  Members of the House will wonder and scoff at the headline in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>: “Government overtakes Church as our least trusted institution”.  The article states that a mere 35% of so-called educated high earners said they trusted the Taoiseach and the Government to do the right thing.  That is why this motion from Fine Gael is justified, despite all the other issues that need attention.  We would not be an Opposition worth its salt if we did not confront the hypocrisy of Ministers attacking a tribunal that they set up, questioning the costs of which they approved and questioning the delays to which their party members, including their leader and our Taoiseach, contributed.  If the tribunal had got straight answers when it asked for them, it would be over by now and its costs would be far less than they are.  That is why this motion is important.  We have been forced to reaffirm our confidence in the efforts and mandate of the Mahon tribunal, which is trying to get to the truth about the issues under investigation in an unbiased way, within its remit.  We will not allow clever political manoeuvring or bullying to knock the tribunal off its course.  The tribunal process has been expensive and it has taken far longer than initially envisaged to get to the bottom of the inquiry.  Our priority should be to get accuracy and truth.  While we would all like matters to be finalised as speedily as possible and to reduce the tribunal’s expenses as much as possible, it is more important to ensure that the tribunal has an opportunity to establish the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Taoiseach has been called to the tribunal to answer the accusation that he took donations from Mr. Owen O'Callaghan, but he has not yet answered those questions.  Fianna Fáil always argues that the manner in which the Taoiseach is being questioned has no relationship with that fundamental issue.  That is not so.  The tribunal has always followed the money trail when it has been dealing with those who have appeared before its hearings.  It has always tried to examine bank accounts and asked for explanations of where certain account entries came from.  The explanation that has been offered in the case of the Taoiseach is simply not credible, unfortunately.  That is why almost everyone who discusses this case in family homes and pubs believes it is unreasonable to expect Opposition politicians not to raise legitimate questions about the credibility of the Taoiseach's evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">New evidence emerged last night, in the context of payments which were made in 1994, about the Taoiseach's relationship with Mr. Norman Turner, a Manchester-based developer who was hoping to invest in a large casino development in the Phoenix Park.  The Taoiseach went to two Manchester United matches with Mr. Turner in 1993 and 1994.  Although Mr. Turner made a donation of $10,000 to Fianna Fáil through Mr. Des Richardson, that figure never appeared in any Fianna Fáil accounts.  Given that we know the Taoiseach organised a passport for Mr. Turner on 9 August 1994, is it not legitimate to ask whether it is more than a coincidence that the Taoiseach lodged £20,000 on 8 August 1994, the day before the passport was issued?  Is it not legitimate to question the fact that the Taoiseach lodged the equivalent of £25,000 sterling — exactly — on 11 October 1994?  Is it not legitimate to ask questions about the Taoiseach's lodgment of the exact equivalent of $45,000 on 5 December 1994?  The lodgments were made at a time when the current Taoiseach, as the Minister for Finance of the time, was being lobbied by somebody with whom he had attended football matches, and for whom he had organised a passport, to allow a casino to be developed in the Phoenix Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I would like to respond to the comments of the Green Party Deputies and to reflect on the absence of the Progressive Democrats Deputies throughout this debate.  The Green Party chose to lecture Fine Gael on its record.  I will not stand up in here and say Fine Gael is without sin in terms of payments to politicians, as it is not without sin.  Fine Gael is a big party.  We have a job to do to ensure we move things forward in our party in the right manner.  We will do that, but we will also hold the Government to account.  The Green Party is trying to lecture my party on corporate donations, while doing nothing about the receipt of such donations by its partners in government, but we will not take that kind of hypocrisy from them.  The Green Party, which spent years on this side of the House jumping up and down about issues of this nature, is now in government.  It is in a position to wield influence, but it is choosing not to do so.  It used to come in here to say the right thing when it was easy for its Members to say the right thing.  In recent times, however, when Fianna Fáil Ministers have gone on the plinth to undermine and attack the tribunal, the Green Party has chosen to be silent.  Green Party Deputies have said during this debate that they support the tribunal and that it should be allowed to get on with its business.  They said nothing when their Cabinet colleagues attacked the tribunal, however.  That is hypocrisy.  We will not take a lecture from the Green Party when it is acting in such a hypocritical manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Progressive Democrats once offered hope to many people in this country.  I say to its representatives, as a young politician in another European country once said to Tony Blair, "you were the future once".  The Progressive Democrats Deputies are so spineless that they will not come to the House to speak on this motion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I wish to deal with two points which have arisen in the context of the Mahon tribunal — the concept of collective Cabinet responsibility and specific aspects of Mrs. Justice Denham's judgment in the Supreme Court, which has been selectively quoted by Fianna Fáil Ministers and on which clarification is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Collective Cabinet responsibility has been repeatedly undermined by Fianna Fáil Ministers over recent months.  Fianna Fáil has always been a party that likes to run with the hare and hunt with the hound.  Its Deputies are fond of assuming the mantle of opposition when it suits them, while continuing to enjoy the privileges of government.  We have seen this in the case of the Aer Lingus debacle at Shannon, just as we have seen it in respect of the Mahon tribunal.  We see Ministers, Ministers of State and Government backbenchers behaving in this manner on an almost weekly basis — this week, it was evident in the debate on co-location.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Fianna Fáil has finally professed its confidence in the Mahon tribunal in recent days, since this motion was submitted by members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  This rare display of co-ordination among Cabinet Ministers follows months of sustained attacks on the integrity of the tribunal by a succession of Ministers, including Deputies Brennan, O'Dea and Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.  This wild flip-flopping from one point of view to another among Ministers is worrying.  It suggests that while the constitutional provision in respect of Cabinet confidentiality remains alive and well, the equally vital provision for collective responsibility has been seriously wounded by Fianna Fáil's opportunism.  Article 28.4.2° of the Constitution states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_271">The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by members of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Government has as much of an obligation to uphold the fundamental principles of the Constitution as any other citizen of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">It is dishonest and hypocritical of individual Ministers to take potshots at the tribunal in an attempt to curry favour with the Taoiseach.  The Ministers who criticise the tribunal undermine the concept of collective responsibility because the Government is legally and constitutionally responsible for proposing that the tribunal be established, deciding how it is run and determining how much money is paid to lawyers.  Until recently, successive Governments displayed a noble respect for the dignity and importance of the Constitution.  Several Ministers resigned rather than breach this law including Richard Mulcahy in 1924, Paddy Smith of Fianna Fáil in 1964 and Frank Cluskey of the Labour Party in 1983.  It is rare for Ministers to be allowed to dissent.  In the two cases that come to mind — those involving Pat Cooney from my own party and Jim Gibbons from the Fianna Fáil Party — permission was sought and granted for them to disagree with Cabinet policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The fundamental importance of collective responsibility to the integrity of government and democracy has been eloquently affirmed by many academics, writers and commentators over the years.  In his review of the Constitution, Dr. T.K. Whitaker put it bluntly when he said that "collective responsibility is, in turn, essential to a Government's ability to plan and act cohesively".  Séamus Dolan of the law faculty at NUIG more recently said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_275">The concept of cabinet confidentiality flows from the notion of collective responsibility, as referred to in Article 28.4.2.  Collective responsibility mandates that individual ministers present a united front to the public, and individual ministers must each offer public support for government decisions and policies, regardless of their own private or personal views on the topic.  This, by implication, means the individual minister is not entitled to criticise government policy or decisions if he wishes to retain his ministerial office.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">When Fintan O'Toole wrote recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the blatant disregard of the Minister, Deputy O’Dea, for collective Cabinet responsibility in the case of Aer Lingus at Shannon, he spelled out the bottom line regarding the attitude of Fianna Fáil to the concept:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_277">The governmental chaos of the last week may look like anarchy, but it is really a form of autocracy: the Government owns the Constitution and can do with it what it likes.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The Mahon tribunal has shone a spotlight on the contempt with which this Government has treated the essential principle of collective Cabinet responsibility.  This practice must be brought to an end.  It is a privilege to serve in Government and that privilege comes at a small cost.  Ministers should not need the Attorney General to remind them of their responsibilities but in this case they clearly do.  The Taoiseach's appearances before the Mahon tribunal have highlighted further worrying precedents in the Government's attitude towards our entire legal system.  In their sycophantic quest to defend the Taoiseach, Ministers, and indeed the Taoiseach's own legal team, have questioned the impartiality and intentions of some of the judges and barristers employed by the State.  This is a most worrying precedent.  The Government may begin to object to the <i>modus operandi</i> of the tribunal and seek to cast aspersions on the impartiality of its judges and legal teams.  Where will this practice end?  Will the Government now question the integrity of the Supreme Court if its judgments or ways of working do not suit its purposes in the future?  A dangerous precedent has been established and that is why it is wholly wrong for Ministers to attack the tribunal for their own narrow party political ends.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Equally disturbing is the Government's practice of selecting sections of a Supreme Court judgment on the tribunal and taking them totally out of context for the purpose of massaging and manipulating public opinion.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and others are at fault in this regard.  The Supreme Court judgment that Ministers are so fond of quoting only highlights the extraordinary delay caused by the lack of co-operation of the Taoiseach and others with the tribunal's processes.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">Deputies Roche, Brennan, O'Dea, Dermot Ahern and others have clearly forgotten the other judgment of the same learned Mrs. Justice Denham on the operation of the Mahon tribunal last year.  I refer to the second O'Callaghan judgment of 30 March 2007, in which she stated: "the work of the Tribunal is of great importance to the community ... The very institution of the Tribunal with its powers risks baseless allegations being made".  This was prophetic indeed, except that no one expected the baseless allegations to come from the corridors of power not far from where we are sitting.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Denham judgment refutes all allegations of unfairness and bias in the tribunal's procedures.  Mrs. Justice Denham categorically refutes these allegations when she states: "A reasonable person, having knowledge of all the facts, and perceiving these decisions of the Tribunal . . . would not have a reasonable apprehension of bias, impartiality or unfairness on behalf of the Tribunal, [and] would not have a reasonable apprehension of prejudgment on the issue of credibility by the Tribunal."  She then comments on the procedures of the tribunal, which have since been scathed by the Fianna Fáil Cabinet, saying that in the first instance the tribunal had established its own procedures, none having been given to it by the Government, and that those procedures had in fact illustrated a very careful approach by the tribunal all along.  Mrs. Justice Denham also calls on bodies not to interfere with the work of the tribunal, stating that it was highly undesirable that the court would have to be called in to review the work of the tribunal while it is still at hearing.  She stated that it was the people's representatives who had established the tribunal and set its terms of reference and that no time limit was set by the Oireachtas for the tribunal to complete its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">These are things that are unlikely to be repeated, but it was this House and this Government that established the tribunal, this Government that set its terms of reference, and this Government that chose not to place a time limit on its operation, and now it is this Government that is seeking to undermine the credibility of the tribunal and its work, but only because it has become too close to the heart of the Government, namely the Taoiseach and his finances.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">Deputy Cuffe made a point about the independence of the Judiciary and the separation of powers.  I agree with what he said on both counts.  I advise Deputy Cuffe and his Green Party colleagues not to direct their ire towards this side of the House.  If he respects the independence of the Judiciary and upholds the separation of powers, let him address the matter to his Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government, with whom he shares a lot of time, particularly in recent months.</p>

          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
          <p eId="para_290">It is important to note that this motion is essentially an attempt to restore public confidence in the Mahon tribunal and its procedures and in the concept of upholding standards in public office and public life.  I probably speak for a number of the newer Deputies when I say that I am absolutely aghast not only at the defensive and hypocritical response we have heard from Government representatives in the Chamber last night and this morning but also at the nature of their attacks over the past number of months.  The tribunal was set up to try to clean up politics, rout out corruption and establish the truth about payments to politicians.  It has gone some distance towards achieving these aims.  It has been working to the best of its ability within the framework established by the Oireachtas — by a Fianna Fáil-led Government — to establish the facts.  At the time the tribunal was established and during the course of its proceedings and the publication of a number of interim reports, most of the senior Cabinet Ministers who spoke on this motion last night and today, as well as the Taoiseach himself, affirmed and reaffirmed their confidence in the value and virtue of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I will highlight some quotes from the Taoiseach in this regard.  Speaking in this Chamber in 2002 about former Deputy Ray Burke, he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_292">The Government has initiated the most far reaching inquiries, not only in the history of this State, but in the recent history of most democratic countries.  We are determined to find the truth, whatever it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Later, he went on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_294">The uncovering of a previously hidden and unacceptable past has undermined confidence in the administration of our affairs.  For politics to recover the confidence of the people the facts must be laid bare . . .</p>
          <p eId="para_295">This is almost laughable in view of the Taoiseach's approach to the tribunal over the last number of months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Deputy Mansergh, who has left the Chamber, has stated again and again his confidence in the tribunal, the Taoiseach and the accounts which he put before the public both before the general election and subsequently.  However, speaking in Seanad Éireann in 2002, he stated: "One of the salutary lessons of the interim report [from the Flood tribunal, now the Mahon tribunal], which will apply to other tribunals and also the future work of the Flood tribunal, is that it gives a clear answer to those who might be tempted to give tribunals the run-around, concoct fantastic or preposterous stories to explain inconsistencies or, in general, show contempt, through the tribunals, to the Oireachtas and the people".  How far Deputy Mansergh has come since he moved from Seanad Éireann to Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The most worrying aspect of this is that for the past six months an independent tribunal of inquiry has come under sustained attack not only by members of the Fianna Fáil Party but also by senior, eminent Cabinet Ministers.  They have bombarded the media with press statements containing attacks on and allegations about the operation and independence of the tribunal.  It is time we laid them bare and exposed the myths they have put forward.  Deputies O'Dea, Dermot Ahern, Hanafin and Roche have all questioned the tribunal at various points.  Deputy Roche stated of the tribunal: "It was petty, it was personal, it was prurient".  He was referring to the cross-examination of the Taoiseach, something that is a natural part of any tribunal of inquiry and is clearly a fundamental step in establishing the truth about the tribunal's subject matter.  The most significant aspect of the sustained attacks by Cabinet Ministers is their timing.  The most disingenuous argument that has emanated from the Government benches on this tribunal is that it has taken too long, been delayed and it is time it concluded its work.  This attack has emerged only in the last six months when the Taoiseach went before the tribunal to give evidence in September and December.  Before that we heard nothing from these Ministers.  Over the last six to nine years there were no questions or criticisms on the delays in the tribunal from the Government benches.  To allege that the issue that concerns Cabinet Ministers is the length of time this tribunal is taking is untrue, misleading and disingenuous.  This is a concerted attempt in the last few months to undermine the tribunal because Ministers are not happy with its findings, the evidence emerging and the questions the Taoiseach has to answer on his tax affairs, personal donations he received and, as we have seen in the last 24 hours, links between him and particular developers and his facilitation of their passport needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">We have seen the mantle of corruption passed through the generations of leadership in Fianna Fáil from former Taoiseach Mr. Charles Haughey, former Deputy Ray Burke and Deputy Bertie Ahern.  We are all aware of the issues with Deputy Bertie Ahern signing blank cheques for his mentor Mr. Haughey.  That mantle of corruption is being passed to the new and future leadership of Fianna Fáil and this is a significant issue.  During the debate on the motion of no-confidence in the Taoiseach we proposed in October, Cabinet Ministers entered this Chamber one by one to defend the Taoiseach.  They too are tainted, and shall be tainted in the future.  On "Prime Time" Deputy Barry Andrews said the tribunal is not a legal process.  It is appalling for a Member of this House to say that.  It is a violation of the separation of powers.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">This motion is a response to an orchestrated and sustained attack on the tribunal by Fianna Fáil Cabinet Ministers and some Ministers of State over the past six months.  A number of Ministers set out to undermine, intimidate and discredit the workings of the tribunal.  I have been in this House for approximately 21 years and I have never before seen this precedent set by Ministers.  I wonder why.  This is a clear and simple motion that supports the view that the tribunal is working independently without bias and within the remit contained in the terms of reference set by the Oireachtas.  Fianna Fáil Ministers have filled the airways with accusations that the tribunal is operating outside this remit and is biased.  If they maintain this view they should place it on record in this House, which they have not done.  They have attacked the tribunal for the past six months and they attack Fine Gael for proposing this motion.  The choreography of what happened in the House before and since is well-directed by the press offices of the Government or Fine Gael — or rather, Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">These attacks by Fianna Fáil Ministers on the tribunal are due to the tribunal's progressing with its work in finding the truth, a truth that does not suit Fianna Fáil.  As a number of speakers mentioned, in 1997 the Taoiseach said in the Dáil that the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry is to follow the money trail, and the tribunal is doing that.  A number of speakers referred to the cost and length of time of the tribunal.  The delays are due to the obfuscation and contradictory statements by many of the principal participants in the tribunal, including the Taoiseach.  The reasons for the attacks on the tribunal by Fianna Fáil Ministers will be revealed only when the findings of the tribunal are published.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_305">I wish to share time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.  The Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, established by the Oireachtas has today, as it has had for the last ten years, all the resources, powers and independence it requires to complete its work.  In his speech opening the debate Deputy Kenny clearly outlined that he and his party have no difficulty prejudging the tribunal's findings.  At the same time, without a hint of irony, he suggested that any Minister raising a question is a "boot boy" who is "intimidating" the tribunal.  Fine Gael has also denounced as "sinister" statements which come nowhere near the type of criticisms levelled by judges of the High Court and Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The course of this debate has confirmed the suspicion that Fine Gael's motion is all about politics and nothing to do with a genuine concern that the tribunal be free to fulfil its terms of reference.  This superficial and complacent motion betrays the motivation of a party which is desperate for others to achieve for it what three leaders have failed to do.  Only in the completion of its work and the publication of its final report will we be able to form a real judgment on the tribunal.  In the interim, Members of this House are entitled to raise concerns if they so choose.  To seek to gag them with the idea that such questions interfere with the tribunal is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The largest and most consistent attempt to undermine the tribunal has been from those who have sought to manipulate its proceedings in different ways, including through the near decade-long selective leaking of documents.  The tribunal has heard evidence of it receiving allegations culled from media reports and passed off as first-hand.  It has heard of a principal witness being used by a journalist to pass on rumours in the form of allegations.  It has confirmed the receipt of forged material designed to back up a false allegation.  In concluding its work, and to demonstrate that it has been balanced, the tribunal will have to pay attention to these and other examples of the abuse and manipulation of its proceedings.  The tribunal should also explain how it can justify bringing <i>The Irish Times</i> to the Supreme Court and threatening its journalists with jail over one leak when no action is being taken to follow up the tidal wave of leaks printed by others.  A circulation policy which all but guarantees these leaks requires either amendment or a better justification than has been provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">All parties agree that the cost of the tribunal is excessive.  It is a pity that the new lower daily rates which former Minister Charlie McCreevy proposed were not accepted by the tribunal's personnel.  However, we would today be hearing even louder attacks if the Government had insisted on these new rates to such an extent that the personnel had resigned.  The solution to the obvious shortcomings of the tribunal on cost and duration is to be found in the Bill published by the last Government.  It is only by enacting it that we will have the right framework for ensuring that inquiries on serious public matters can be carried out more effectively in future.</p>

Since 1997 the legal and administrative framework within which politicians at local and national levels operate has been transformed.  Many of the abuses which have been dealt with at the tribunal have been addressed comprehensively.  We need the tribunal's work to proceed to a conclusion, which includes treating all persons fairly and to the same standards.  It should also involve seeking to challenge those who have caused it serious difficulty through attempting to manipulate it.  The legislation we have enacted for the tribunal and the resources which the Government has provided for it ensure it is free to carry out its work with full independence.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">This debate is important and should not be trivialised by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, because it gives us a special window on the future of Irish politics and the standards that we must all embrace.  It provides a real opportunity for those on the other side of the House who have been conferred with leadership status or have leadership ambitions, like the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to place a distinctive footprint on the political stage.  It also allows those, such as the junior Ministers and junior Government partners, who present themselves publicly as being wed to principle, probity and the public good, to put substance behind their public posturing.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">There are times in politics when people believe they must take a stand on what is right and proper.  They must be brave, courageous and act out of real concern for the wider community rather than their own personal interest.  They must display true leadership, conviction and integrity, even if that discommodes long-standing friendships, upsets personal convenience or threatens the preservation of patronage and power.  They must eschew political loyalties, if that is required, to do what is right and proper.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The Mahon tribunal arose primarily as a result of the actions of dishonest, dishonourable and deceitful people who put their personal gain above the achievement of the public good that they were either elected, or employed, to serve.  The dishonour they have conferred on what should have been a noble calling to the profession of politics, an honour and a privilege that has been given to us by our constituents, is incalculable.  The actions of the few have cast a slur on all politicians and it will take at least a generation of politics before that slur is lifted.  They have blighted us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">What is equally important to recognise is that the Mahon tribunal arose because of an inadequate ethics and public standards regime.  Since the mid-1990s, we have introduced a new regime of ethics in public office, which has played catch-up ever since.  We have a bolt-on ethics regime, one which has evolved and developed as each political scandal unfolds, and we discover the inadequacy of the previous legislation.  The ethics regime seems to be arriving breathless at each new scandal and requires the topical treatment of new legislation to allow it to prepare for the next ethics crisis.  The Minister for Finance has impeded and frustrated the resourcing and reform of the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">One section of the Government amendment deals with the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005.  That Bill provides for the suspension, under section 9, and the dissolution, under section 10, of a tribunal of inquiry, on notice to the Chairman and after a resolution has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill applies to tribunals already established and any which may subsequently be established by the Oireachtas.  Enacting this Bill while the Mahon tribunal is in session is an implicit threat to that tribunal and its operations.  True independence of the tribunal requires that the Oireachtas does not purport, either by accident or design, to undermine or threaten it, personally, in terms of its members, or institutionally, as an operative body.  The debate and enactment of this Bill should be delayed until the tribunal has concluded its business and presented its report to this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The Government amendment also supports the opportunity to discuss procedures and practices involved in investigating matters mandated by the Oireachtas.  Fine Gael opposes this element of the amendment on the grounds that it formalises the explicit and implicit undermining of the tribunal by Ministers in this debate forum.  This is nothing more than a cover for sniping at the tribunal in the manner which we have seen in the past couple of months, when the heat is rising in respect of the Taoiseach's evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Ministers have, on many occasions, referred to leaks from the tribunal and cast a shadow of doubt over whether the tribunal was the source of the leaks of confidential information.  Such behaviour is completely unacceptable.  In response to these attacks by Fianna Fáil on the tribunal, Judge Mahon had to use up valuable tribunal time to engage in an intensive investigation to refute these attacks.  This investigation involved questioning all relevant tribunal staff and Judge Mahon concluded that no evidence was found that the tribunal was in any way responsible for leaking any confidential information.  However, Fianna Fáil continues to attack the tribunal and lay the blame for leaks firmly at its doorstep.  What is Fianna Fáil's real motive?  Perhaps it should look closer to home for the source of the leaks.  In the words of Judge Mahon, perhaps the reason information was leaked was "to try and damage the Tribunal itself by allowing it to be suggested, or inferred, that the Tribunal has been the source of leaking of confidential material to others".</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I am sure Deputy Noel Tracey can remember telling everyone, over the airwaves, that the tribunal was responsible for the leaks and that he even knew who was doing it.  However, he was forced into an incredible and humiliating admission that he had no evidence, or any basis to form this opinion, once he was questioned by the tribunal.  Again, this was a diversionary tactic by Fianna Fáil to keep attention away from the Taoiseach.  I have no doubt that this tribunal will continue its work to find the truth, despite continued Fianna Fáil sniping and obstructionist tactics.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I support the amendment proposed by the Labour Party, particularly with regard to fees.  The Government had an opportunity in 2004 to deal with the fees, if it was serious about reducing them.  It went up the hill but came back down again when it discovered that its proposals were not acceptable to tribunal personnel and, effectively, that the tribunal could be closed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I wish to make a number of additional remarks concerning the passport issue that I raised yesterday.  On 8 July 1994, Mr. John Hynes, chairman of the national lottery board, wrote to Deputy Bertie Ahern, then Minister for Finance, advising him that the National Lottery was studying the feasibility of a casino and invited his views.  On 4 August 1994, Mr. Ray Bates, Chief Executive of the National Lottery, informed the Department of Finance that Mr. Hynes had informal contact with the Department of the Taoiseach and had been in touch with the Vector Ogden group about proposals which involved a casino on the Phoenix Park site.  On 31 August 1994, Mr. Hynes briefed the Department of Finance, of which Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister, on his involvement with the casino project.  He indicated that he had a series of meetings with the promoters of the Vector Ogden group and that the real driving force regarding casino matters was Mr. Norman Turner.  Mr. Hynes reported that he had explained to Mr. Turner that the casino project would involve amending gaming and lotteries legislation, something which successive Ministers for Justice had been loathe to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">According to the Department of Finance file, "Mr. Turner said that he had had a series of meetings with Government Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, from which he claimed to have received assurances that there would be no problem about the amending of legislation".</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Mr. Hynes's briefing on 31 August 1994 also involved confirmation that he had briefed the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on his contacts with the casino promoters.  In the course of that briefing Mr. Hynes expressed concern about the scale of gambling operations envisaged.  According to the Department of Finance file, the then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, apparently shared Mr. Hynes's misgivings about the extent of gaming machines involved in the project but, other than that issue, there is no indication that he expressed opposition to the concept of the casino project.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">There was chaos and contradictions, and now there is cowardice.  That is the sum total of this Government's assault on the Mahon tribunal.  For the past year or more, Fianna Fáil Ministers have relentlessly attacked the tribunal.  One Minister after another has come out to attack it.  One Minister after another has impugned its integrity.  One complaint after another has been made in an effort to distract from the chaos of the Taoiseach's evidence.  Let me be absolutely clear, particularly when addressing the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan — I am not referring to the chaos of the Taoiseach's personal finances.  Rather, I am referring to the chaos of his evidence.  One day, black is white.  The next day, the suggestion is that he never stated black was white and that he meant black was pink.  In the context of the coalition Government, black is green with a tinge of blue, the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Chaos is a great distraction from truth.  The Taoiseach is a past master at creating chaos.  Around the inescapable contradiction, he blames the passage of time, the media and the tribunal.  Out come his Ministers, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in support of the unsupportable.  Out come his Ministers cloaking their protection of their leader by discussing the cost of the lawyers, about which they failed to do anything and in respect of whose fees they agreed originally, or the time taken by the tribunal.  They do not discuss whether witnesses such as Ray Burke, Liam Lawlor, Frank Dunlop or the Taoiseach himself spoke honestly in private or public session at or in correspondence with the tribunal.  If they spoke honestly when asked the relevant questions, the tribunal would have concluded years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">The Taoiseach has difficulty divvying up the truth.  He has forced the tribunal to keep digging, as was its right and remit.  However, cowardice came into play this week.  Suddenly, the Government was not really attacking the tribunal.  In Fianna Fáil's amendment, it accepts the independence of the Mahon tribunal and has removed any of the references to bias and lack of fairness made by successive Ministers before Christmas.  Fianna Fáil accepts the tribunal is doing its job independently and well, for which I thank the party, but this is a new variation of the Fianna Fáil characteristic of opportunism, namely, opportunism by cowardice.  It is watering down what it stated originally and relying on the pathetic acquiescence of the Progressive Democrats and the equally disgraceful collusion of the Green Party.  Play the numbers game and the Taoiseach will hang on.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">A firm commitment was made by the Taoiseach during the Twenty-ninth Dáil that a full-scale debate on collusion would be held following the publication of the report of Patrick MacEntee, SC, into the Garda and Government investigation of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974.  The MacEntee report was published in April 2007.  The promised debate was not held soon thereafter as promised, nor was it held during the remainder of the Twenty-ninth Dáil.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_794">Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Only now has the Government finally scheduled this statement opportunity.  This has been especially disappointing and frustrating for the families of victims of collusion.  The form of the so-called debate is unsatisfactory as there is no motion and no proposal for action.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">It is also frustrating in the extreme that this debate has been given a title that does not mention the word "collusion".  The investigations by Mr. Justice Barron, the reports of the joint Oireachtas committee and the inquiry of Patrick MacEntee, SC, were not, as the title states vaguely, on "violent incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland".  They were on attacks, including mass murders, where British State collusion with Unionist paramilitaries was strongly indicated.  Throughout the long search for truth on collusion, there has been an attempt by some to muddy the waters, a process that serves only further to shield those at the highest level in the British State who bore ultimate responsibility.  I hope that muddying of the waters is not repeated in the remainder of this two-day opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Every singe death in the conflict was a tragedy.  No family's grief counts less than any other and there should never be a hierarchy of victims.  That is the overall context in which we address deaths arising from the conflict.  However, it is necessary to be specific and to deal frankly and honestly with the issue of where responsibility lies and how and why many of the tragedies of our past took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">In Ireland, as in conflicts across the world, the Government in power held all the advantages in terms of controlling the apparatus of the State, the legal system and, to a great extent, the mass media.  The British Government tried to convince the world that it was a peacekeeper, a policeman, a neutral force keeping the warring sides apart.  It tried to mask its central role in the conflict.  It was for this reason that it resorted so extensively to collusion.  It was better to have Unionist paramilitaries front the war than to have the international embarrassment of the British army and the RUC carrying out an open campaign of terror in the manner of the Black and Tans.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">To the shame of successive Irish Governments they co-operated to a great extent with the British Government in its so-called security strategies.  They turned a blind eye to collusion.  British agents worked within the Garda.  There was open co-operation with the RUC during the worst phase of its repression against the Nationalist community in the Six Counties.  Political prisoners were extradited to face the Diplock Court system.  Even as the Irish Government politely protested about the fate of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and other victims of British State injustice, it was sending its citizens into that system.  This is the reality which many in this House, now as in the past, are unwilling to state.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Let us make clear what this debate is about.  It primarily concerns the acts of collusion or direct action by British forces which led to loss of life in this jurisdiction.  These acts included the bombing of Belturbet, County Cavan, in December 1972 in which two teenage civilians were killed, Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley; the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973 in which three bus workers were killed, George Bradshaw, Thomas Duffy and Thomas Douglas; the killing of Briege Porter and Oliver Boyce by the UDA near Burnfoot, County Donegal, in 1973; the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974 in which 33 people died, 26 in Dublin and seven in Monaghan, including people I knew personally, Peggy White, Jack Travers, Archie Harper, Patrick Askin, Thomas Campbell, George Williamson and Thomas Croarkin; the killing of IRA volunteer, John Francis Green in County Monaghan in January 1975, probably by a British army operative; the stabbing to death of civilian Christy Phelan near Sallins, County Kildare, in June 1975; the explosion at Dublin Airport in November 1975 in which John Hayes was killed; the Dundalk bombing of December 1975 in which two civilians were killed, Hugh Watters and Jack Rooney; the Castleblayney bombing of March 1976 in which one person, Patrick Mone, was killed; the killing of Seamus Ludlow in County Louth in May 1976; the killing of Sinn Féin councillor Eddie Fullerton in Donegal in May 1991; and the killing of IRA volunteer Martin Doherty in May 1994, having foiled an attempted bombing and mass murder at the Widow Scallan's pub in this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">To these tragedies in this jurisdiction should be added the killing of three members of the Miami showband near Newry in July 1975.  The web of collusion links their murders to that of the Dublin and Monaghan May 1974 bombings and to the John Francis Green murder.  The link with British army Captain Robert Nairac and the Portadown UVF is also well known and is but one facet of the long history of collusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Understated as it was, the MacEntee report highlighted a massive failure on the part of this State to properly investigate the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974.  The only logical explanation for what took place is a cover-up of collusion.  Gross incompetence is not enough to explain the failure to investigate and the apparent destruction of records.  The report again exposed the refusal of the British authorities to co-operate with a commission of inquiry established by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The Taoiseach expressed incredulity at the short duration of the so-called Garda investigation that followed.  He can initiate an independent investigation of Garda inaction and into the mysterious loss of the relevant files in the hands of the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Why has he not acted on this element that is solely within his gift?</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Prior to the publication of the MacEntee report, Sinn Féin published a Dáil motion on collusion that was drafted in consultation with groups such as the Pat Finucane Centre, the Justice for Eddie Fullerton Campaign, Justice for the Forgotten and Relatives for Justice.  Such a motion should have formed the basis for this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The key points we made in that motion must be restated.  The findings of a variety of reports justify the demand for full, independent, public judicial inquiries including the Barron report which concluded that a cover-up involving British forces, the Garda and the Irish Government could not be ruled out in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings; the Cory report into the murder of Pat Finucane and the involvement of at least five agents of the British state in that one particular killing; the report of the independent international panel on collusion in sectarian killings, which concluded that in 24 of the 25 cases examined, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, there was "significant and credible evidence of involvement of police and military agents of the United Kingdom, both directly and in collusion with loyalist extremists"; the various Oireachtas committee reports on various acts of collusion; and the investigative report of the former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, into the circumstances surrounding the death of Raymond McCord junior and related matters which exposed the systemic reality and extent of collusion, including collusion in attacks undertaken by loyalist paramilitaries in the 26 Counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Both the British and Irish Governments have failed to establish the inquiries repeatedly sought by relatives seeking truth and justice.  This is despite statements such as those by the Taoiseach as recently as 10 December 2007 when he said that the suffering of victims had been sharpened "by the clear evidence of collusion by the security forces in many murders".  It is now nearly two years since the all-party Dáil motion of 8 March 2006 which called for the immediate establishment of a full, independent, public judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  The British Government has refused to establish such an inquiry.  It persists in proposing a flawed form of inquiry which would be under the effective control of a British Minister.  The Irish Government's case in calling for a full inquiry has been undermined not only by its own failure to establish collusion inquiries, but also its own Tribunals of Inquiry Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">No one can deny we are in need of new legislation to govern the work of tribunals.  The existing legislation dates back as far as 1921.  It must be clear to everyone that spiralling legal costs and the refusal of witnesses to co-operate with tribunals needs to be addressed.  However, as the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill is currently drafted, Sinn Féin must oppose it.  We believe the proposed legislation could be used by future governments to stop public inquiries from delivering the truth to the public and to the families of victims of collusion in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The Bill as drafted is very similar to the British Inquiries Act.  That Act is widely viewed as having been constructed to act as a barrier to a full public inquiry taking place into the murder of Pat Finucane.  This Bill if passed would not only jeopardise the ability of any future tribunal to uncover the truth surrounding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the murders of Seamus Ludlow, Councillor Eddie Fullerton and Martin Doherty among others, but it would also undermine the cases of all those in the Six Counties who are seeking inquiries into state collusion because the British Government could point to this legislation in order to justify its own.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">This Bill would effectively give the Government power over whether to establish a tribunal of inquiry at all, its members and crucially its terms of reference.  It would also effectively give the Government the power to suspend or dissolve a tribunal for unlimited reasons and to prevent the publication of a tribunal's report.  These are very serious deficiencies.  In our view, this is completely unacceptable and will not instil any confidence among either the general public or more crucially those who have been specifically affected and are seeking the full truth about events.  The relatives and those representing victims of collusion have long sought full, independent and public inquiries.  We must work together to ensure that no legislation is introduced that would jeopardise and compromise the independence of future inquiries that we have been seeking for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Two months after the Dáil unanimously passed the all-party motion calling for an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, Ken Barrett, the only person convicted in connection with the murder, was released after serving three years.  He was brought by the British Ministry of Defence to a secret hideout outside Ireland.  In the case of Ken Barrett, a deal was done and a guilty plea ensured that there was no trial and no exposure of the central role of British forces in the murder.  The same thing happened with the other British agent involved in the Finucane murder, Brian Nelson.  Collusion is not only something that happened in the past, but it also continues up to the present day — a situation we must also confront.  The British are clearly still protecting their agents.  They have refused the demand of the Oireachtas for an inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">I repeat Sinn Féin's demand for the Taoiseach to hold a special summit meeting with the British Prime Minister solely focused on the issue of collusion.  It is the Taoiseach's responsibility to create such an opportunity to demand the British Government to provide access to all the original documents relating to the acts of collusion carried out in this jurisdiction that I have cited and indeed to the whole record of collusion in its possession.  The demand should be made publicly and the Government's efforts should be open and witnessed not only by all opinion here, but also internationally.  By such an approach the British Government's response, whatever it might be, would be equally open to global scrutiny.  If it continues to refuse, it should face the censure of all nations.  If the British Government continues to refuse, the Irish Government should act unilaterally and establish a full independent public judicial inquiry into all these British state-sponsored atrocities and with key international participation by invitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The Taoiseach and the Government must act on behalf of the citizens of Ireland and no further delay is excusable.  The search for truth and justice regarding all these atrocities is far from over.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Tom Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_812">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important debate.  I use the word "debate" deliberately.  There has been some discussion on the issue of having statements.  I wish to assure especially those in the Visitors Gallery and families of victims that this is an important debate affording people a chance to air their views and bring these issues into the public domain.  As the Taoiseach has said, we can then decide collectively where we go from here.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">With the extraordinary developments we have seen in Northern Ireland over the past year, no one on this island can doubt that this generation has an opportunity like no other — an opportunity for an inclusive society, a peaceful life and an agreed future, recognising the legitimate rights and aspirations of all.  Our present and our future have not looked so bright for a long time as we would all agree.  With that opportunity comes a profound responsibility.  We must seize this chance and build on it.  We must, in the words of the Good Friday Agreement, achieve the "peaceful and just society that would be the true memorial to the victims of violence".  It is not an easy or a straightforward task.  We must ensure that the future is built on stable foundations.  In a democratic society, that means respect for truth, justice, human rights, accountability and transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">In a peaceful society, that means a collective commitment to good relations across divisions.  It can also challenge people to move forward to some degree from the confrontation of the past to a shared future.  In this moment of achievement and optimism, it is entirely appropriate that we look at the legacy of the past and how we might address it anew, in a way that will contribute to continuing and imbedding this process of positive change.  To get there, we must look again at the awful legacies of the Troubles.  First is the appalling human loss — of life, of loved ones, of wholeness of heart and of body.  These cannot be made right.  We are left simply with the duty to meet as fully as we can the lasting physical and psychological needs of those who have suffered most.  The wider social and economic legacies of distrust and separation, sectarianism and deprivation, are enormous challenges that must be faced.  Lingering questions are outstanding from the past as are contested histories and justifications that sow division in the present.  Unsolved murders leave families in a cruel limbo, without closure or peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">It is the allegations of State collusion that are perhaps the most difficult, casting shadows as they do, both on the families of victims as well as on the relationship of trust and the duty of care between citizen and State.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The Oireachtas has played a valuable role in bringing to light such events.  Following a recommendation from the victims' commissioner, the late John Wilson, the Government established an independent commission of inquiry in 2000, initially led by the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton and subsequently by Mr. Justice Henry Barron.  Its purpose was to undertake a thorough examination of certain atrocities committed by loyalist paramilitaries in this jurisdiction, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the murder of Seamus Ludlow and the bombing of Kay's Tavern.  The commission produced four reports, each of which was subsequently considered by a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  The sub-committee published each of the Barron reports in the course of its work and held public hearings.  A corresponding series of four reports from the committee were published, which contained some stark findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The committee also acknowledged that the failure to make definitive conclusions in respect of the role of the security forces exacerbated the pain and suffering of the victims and their relatives.  I wish to extend my condolences to those relatives, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery.  It is not our intention that our discussion would re-open wounds but we wish to help shine a light on the way forward.  It is therefore important that their anxiety for truth and justice, arising from these reports, is widely understood.  This is the reason the Taoiseach has asked the British Government to examine the findings of the Barron, Oireachtas sub-committee and MacEntee inquiries and this debate underlines that concern.  This is a matter which the Government will pursue relentlessly.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">We also remember just how difficult and deep-seated a conflict it was and how important it has been to change the political and security context in Northern Ireland.  Policing and justice reform was an essential part of the Good Friday Agreement and one of its great successes.  It was a project to reform the police and create an institution representative of, and working effectively for, all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">It was an enormous and emotive task to restore confidence across the community and build relationships around what had been a front line of conflict.  It required considerable courage and vision by political leaders and by members of the police and security forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The construction of effective institutions of accountability and public representation was absolutely crucial.  I pay tribute to the role of Nuala O'Loan as Police Ombudsman.  I was privileged to meet her when I visited Northern Ireland as Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I pay tribute to the independence, integrity and fearlessness she showed and which did so much to build the trust of the public in this new era of policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The policing board and district policing partnerships have also played a crucial role.  Through the leadership of the SDLP and since last year with the decision of Sinn Féin to nominate members, relationships have been developed which have introduced new levels of responsiveness and transparency to policing.  This is also shown by the efforts of the Police Ombudsman and the PSNI historical inquiries team to address outstanding cases from the past.  As a result the context in Northern Ireland has been changed utterly.  A new consensus on policing and justice adds greatly to the stability of the institutions and the stability and security of everyone.  We must ensure that in questioning the events of the past, we do not ignore the achievements.  Once more, the first reaction to failures and wrongdoing must be to ensure that measures are put in place to prevent them happening again and extraordinary progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I look to the consultative group on the past, chaired by Lord Eames and Denis Bradley, to come forward with proposals on all the issues under discussion.  It will be of great importance to look at the question of dealing with the past in a comprehensive way and I commend the group for its wide consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">There are examples from across the world of how difficult periods from the past have been addressed by different countries.  I refer to South Africa and East Timor.  I remind the Acting Chairman that he and I spent some time as parliamentarians in the southern African region dealing with many of these issues of healing the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">We have examined the structures in place in other countries.  I remember being in East Timor when I was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and working with people such as Tom Hyland and others who were working closely with NGOs on the ground.  They were dealing with the transition from a period of violence to one of peace.  Irish Aid was known at that time as Irish Development Co-operation and it funded this process.  The move from conflict to a peaceful society has been a challenge to deal with in South Africa, East Timor and in many other parts of the world.  We have spoken to many people in these countries and studied how they have dealt with such situations.  We can learn from each other.  These are sensitive, complex issues but they all point to one fact, that we must get to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The variety of these approaches in different parts of the world confirms that any mechanism we might consider will have to take full account of the unique situation and nature of the conflict and settlement.  Any new comprehensive approach will have strengths and weaknesses, difficulties and opportunities and it is only through proper consultation and dialogue that a way forward can be agreed, and it must be agreed.  This is not an area where something can be pushed through or imposed from any quarter.  We must recognise the great diversity of views on this question.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Everyone who has suffered has the right to be heard, North and South, elsewhere in these islands, victims in cases of collusion and victims of terrorist bombs.  In all these cases those who simply wish to know the facts of what happened to their loved one, must be heard.  Those who want to see the perpetrator of their own awful loss tried and put in jail, must be heard.  Those who just want to tell the story of what happened to them and for it to be acknowledged and remembered, must be heard.  Those who want nothing for themselves except to take their own suffering and story and make it part of a wider reconciliation, must be heard.  Those who simply want to forget, to stop the debate on the past and be left to their own mourning and their own lives, must be heard.  All these voices will be raised and listened to with emotion.  Often people will hear only the other side being talked about and they will see selectivity and political motives at work.  Sometimes they will be right and if the discussion is approached in a spirit of confrontation or sterile recrimination, then it will achieve nothing.  However, I have heard many inspiring voices of those who have suffered most.  I have heard many people who have experienced unspeakable suffering say that they wish to move on, that reconciliation not retribution is needed.  I have heard straightforward requests for more services to help them cope, more facts to help them understand and more recognition by politicians of what has to be done to ensure their tragedy never happens to another family.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">With the progress we have seen since last year it is perhaps a time when the questions of what we do from here can be asked with more generosity and openness than before and with a genuine mutual respect and the objective of a shared and honest understanding of our recent past.  This objective has been taken forward by the work of a great number of civil society and community groups across Northern Ireland.  This is a vital part of this public debate.  It is a dialogue beyond the political level, inclusive of the whole of the society and within local communities most affected by the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I commend to the House the work of Healing Through Remembering, a cross-community organisation bringing together representatives from North and South and Britain, of victims' groups, churches, academics, community and youth organisations.  They have produced reports and recommendations on issues including truth recovery, commemoration, acknowledgement and story telling.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">These are thoughtful and well-researched documents that deserve careful consideration.  They would serve as a very useful reference for the work of the consultative group on the past.  There are no easy or straightforward answers to these issues.  However, I am confident that this House, and the people in general have a positive role to play in this debate and in this collective effort to ensure the peace we have found on this island is a just and a lasting one.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_830">I wish to share time with Deputy Crawford.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">First I wish to express my sympathy to the relatives of the victims of terrorist atrocities which is the subject of the discussion, many of whom have come to listen to this debate.  They have suffered a great deal but they have also been tireless in their efforts to establish the facts surrounding the loss of their loved ones.  My colleagues and I have supported their calls for today's debate and I welcome everyone to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Notwithstanding that the party Whips have agreed to set time aside for statements on this important topic, I regret that we did not achieve an all-party motion which was my understanding and which was reported in the media.  I am not sure of the circumstances surrounding what happened but I wish to place on record that in spite of what the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt said, no formal contact was made with the Fine Gael Party with a view to agreeing or constructing a motion which would have given far greater effect to the debate taking place yesterday and today.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The victims of crime and terrorism and their families are often ignored, neglected and overlooked by official authorities and organs of State.  The weak position of victims in Irish law is an issue that Fine Gael is striving to address, having recently published an extensive Private Members' Bill aimed at enhancing victims' rights and placing the victim at the centre of the justice system.  In regard to the atrocities investigated by the Barron reports, the fact that the victims and their families were overlooked is exacerbated by the incompetent handling of the investigations into the various atrocities.  Quite simply, the victims and their families were let down by the State.  Today's Dáil statements are part of an effort to redress this wrong.  We fully recognise the desire of victims and their families to establish the truth and the facts and not only to learn from what happened but to be able to piece together the difficult issues that remain outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I acknowledge the work of my colleagues on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in this area.  Four sub-committees examined the four Barron reports and, reading the sub-committees' publications, it is obvious that a huge amount of work went into the committee hearings.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">The legacy of the Troubles casts a long shadow over the lives of people on the island of Ireland.  Nowhere is this more deeply felt than among the victims of violence and their relatives.  I agree with much of what the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has said in this regard.  We have made great strides in moving on from a painful past when politically-motivated violence was a daily occurrence.  The fully functioning power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland is a living testament to how far we have come in the past decade since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in April 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">A vital component of the peace process included a recognition that the suffering of victims of violence be recognised and addressed and, to this end, a victims commission was established, the work of which I acknowledge.  The commission's 1999 report identified the need for further investigation into certain specific crimes, primarily the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which was the worst single day of violence during the Troubles, but also including other bombings in Dublin, Dundalk and elsewhere; and the murder of Seamus Ludlow on 1 May 1976.  That no prosecutions were made following these crimes has, naturally, been a cause of great distress to the victims' families.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The consequent establishment of what became known as the Barron inquiry constituted a key turning point for those who had sought an inquiry into atrocities perpetrated in the Republic during the Troubles.  The detailed consideration of the Barron reports by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the establishment of the MacEntee inquiry and today's provision of time for statements in the Dáil underlines the commitment of the Oireachtas to honouring the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, and, in particular, its recommendations in respect of the victims of violence during the Troubles.  The purpose and value of any inquiry is not just to establish facts; it is vital that lessons be learned from the past.  Where procedures and practices were shown to be flawed or wrong, it is essential that we learn from these and put mechanisms in place to improve systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The Government in power in 1974 at the time of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings has come in for severe criticism for its handling of the aftermath of the atrocities.  While I recognise that in many cases criticism is warranted, it is impossible to judge the past by the standards of the present.  The fact that it took 25 years for the victims of relatives of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to secure a meeting with a Taoiseach gives some sense of the vital role played by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 in creating the circumstances in which we could move forward into a better future while taking important lessons from the difficulties of the past.  I understand the deeply felt desire of the families of the victims for truth and justice and I reaffirm the commitment of the Fine Gael Party to do all we can as Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that those responsible for the crimes investigated by the Barron and MacEntee reports are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The range of reports into various atrocities perpetrated during the Troubles, including the Barron, MacEntee and O'Loan reports, suggest that in some cases there was a degree of collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries.  This shocking finding reminds us of the warped political culture that existed in Northern Ireland until very recently.  The collusion by those entrusted with the safety of the citizens with terrorists in the murder of innocents is a gross violation of trust, principle and law and a situation that should never be tolerated by any Government.  Collusion has exacerbated the suffering of victims of terrorism and their families and must be condemned in absolute terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">From a personal point of view, as Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am particularly concerned with the revelation of the MacEntee report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings that the Garda Síochána failed to maintain the integrity of its files.  This finding is extremely disturbing.  The destruction or loss of documentation in regard to the bombings is totally unacceptable and can only add to the pain of the victims' relatives, friends and communities.  It is vital that lessons are taken from this revelation and that we can ensure this never happens again.  In recent years many changes have been introduced to the Garda Síochána as a result of various inquiries and tribunals and the essential import of maintaining files and carefully preserving evidence is underlined for us by the MacEntee report.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Notwithstanding our own bleak record to preserve documentation and evidence, like my colleagues, I am disappointed by the lack of co-operation from the British Government in regard to the attempts by the Irish Government to investigate atrocities carried out here during the Troubles.  I acknowledge what the Taoiseach said and I urge him and his colleagues to do all they can to secure the release of the necessary documents from the British Government archives and files.  I hope that a mechanism can be found through the various British-Irish bodies, in particular, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, of which my colleague, Deputy Crawford, has for many years been a proud and active member.  I was a member of the body myself.  Perhaps consideration might be given at some level towards moving on matters through the auspices of that body.  I hope the Taoiseach will avail of the opportunity presented by his meetings with Prime Minister Gordon Brown to ensure we can advance this issue which, regrettably, has been neglected by the British authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I again express my sympathy to the families of the victims.  I understand the need on their behalf and on behalf of all of us for the establishment of the facts in regard to the loss of loved ones in order to achieve closure and honour their memories in an acceptable way.  Fine Gael will continue to support the victims in that quest.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_843">I welcome this opportunity to speak on issues which affected so many people north and south of the Border during the past 40 years.  I, too, offer my sympathy to all those who lost loved ones or whose loved ones were maimed.  I purposely decided not to name any individuals in this debate.  As the Taoiseach stated last night, 3,700 people lost their lives by various means in the Troubles in the past 40 years and 40,000 suffered serious injury.  That is the legacy we have to debate today.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I decry the fact that when names were mentioned the only Member of this House who lost his life in those Troubles was ignored.  The former Deputy and Senator, Billy Fox, was a close personal friend of mine.  He was shot in the back solely because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  That is part of the legacy of the Troubles.  My party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, and our spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, who has already spoken, deal with the legal and structural issues, not just today but over the years, in trying to get as much information as possible for those who have suffered as a result of bombing and murders from whatever source.  Those in this House who accused me of not getting involved may have seen in the past 24 hours how the structures work.  It is not the ordinary backbenchers but my party leader, Deputy Kenny, who leads the questions on issues like this, as does the parliamentary party leader of Sinn Féin, Deputy Ó Caoláin, and others, but I have been there to support every effort to bring forth information and inquiries where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Clearly, the issue of the Monaghan bombing has been close to my heart.  Some of those murdered by the bomb were among my closest friends.  Others maimed for life were similarly close.  After my election to Dáil Éireann, I made it my business to contact as many as possible of the families who had suffered from that bomb and all but one made it clear to me that their main interest was in moving on with their lives rather than in getting involved in any public debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Since then, much of the debate during Taoiseach's question time has been led by my party leader not just on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, but on the Pat Finucane case and others and it is clear that there are still many questions to be answered.  I encourage the Taoiseach — I was a little disappointed by his speech last night — and his Ministers to use their current close relationship with their counterparts in the UK to co-operate fully with the different inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">For me, the main issue is that we move on and that we cement the peace process which, hopefully, will see an end to the times, which I remember as and which some seem to forget were nothing short of open war.  In war, things happen of which nobody or no party can be proud.  Only this morning I spoke to a young man who was travelling right behind an unmarked van when it blew up in front of him, murdering all those inside.  If his mother had driven their vehicle up along the side of the van at the traffic lights, he certainly would not be here today.  He was a close friend, in fact, a grandson, of one of those murdered in the Monaghan bomb.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I also clearly remember the Omagh bombing to which there are still no answers, even though it happened much more recently than the others.  Many victims of the Omagh bomb have come to my office over the years in desperation to find answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The death of Mr. Paul Quinn is another tragic example of recent times and, unfortunately, we have learned only in the past few days that other young men are under threat.  It is important to remember that while the work of Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, as First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, rightly gets much good publicity, there are still serious intimidation and beatings which go virtually unpublished, together with other types of intimidation within both the hardline republican and loyalist areas.  I know this from first-hand advice from friends living in both types of areas.  While we must support in every way possible those who have suffered, our main object is to ensure it stops and never happens again.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I was in a house one night and said to the family that we must move on.  I did not know at that time that the lady's brother was one of those murdered, shot in the back at his place of worship.  There was no inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">I, too, want to be associated with the sympathy expressed to those who died not only in the Monaghan bomb, but in Belturbet, Castleblaney and the other places.  I live only a few miles from the Border and I knew many of the small farmers who died north of the Border.  I knew many of the people from both sides of the religious and political divide who were murdered just because they were from the wrong religion or in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">I urge the Taoiseach, as has been sought in the letter from Justice for the Forgotten, to ensure that access is given to all information relating to the atrocities that are being inquired into.  It is vital, if there is to be true reconciliation, that these matters are dealt with in a proper fashion.  Above all else, we must deal with the small number of those on both sides who want to continue to create trouble and are in the process of buying guns, bombs, etc.  They must be brought to justice and stopped, once and for all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_853">I wish to share time with Deputy O'Connor.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate.  It is a significant debate at a time when the steady progress with the peace process in the North has come to a stage where we are examining historically, reflecting on and considering both the short and long-term implications of many of the incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">A number of speakers have raised as a starting point of this debate the 3,700 people who were killed in the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  There were countless more seriously injured, with families bereaved and traumatised as a result.  These statistics tell us forcefully why thousands continue to question why loved ones had to die or suffer grievous physical and emotional injury through the period of the Troubles.  These sufferings must be addressed if reconciliation is to develop, grow and take hold in the Six Counties.  We all accept that it will take time.  I am sure both Governments appreciate that and I am sure the Ministers directly involved on both sides realise it as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">My constituency of Louth was at the coalface of the Troubles in the North from the late 1960s until the peace process took hold in the 1990s.  Too many brutal murders were committed during that time.  A number of them have been the subject of inquiry, notably the Barron inquiries, and two cases in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The first of these was the brutal murder of an unmarried forestry worker, Mr. Seamus Ludlow, just north of Dundalk in May 1976.  To date, nobody has been prosecuted for that crime.  The brutal murder of Mr. Ludlow has had a profound effect on his family.  Over the years they have worked tirelessly to get to the truth of his murder and it is a great credit to them that their determination to get to the truth is as strong today as it was in May 1976.  I sincerely hope that a suitable public inquiry formula can be agreed to allow the circumstances surrounding the case to be fully and satisfactorily examined and reported on.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The bombing of Kay's Tavern in Crowe Street in Dundalk in December 1975 was another incident in Louth.  Two people were killed and many were injured.  The Barron inquiry reported that the UVF and the British security forces colluded in the attack on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge the same evening.  The obvious question is whether the British security forces were aware of the bombing in Dundalk on the same day.  The Barron report concluded that a UVF gang from Glenanne were behind the shootings in Silverbridge.  The Barron report further concluded that the British security forces should have known who were responsible for the Dundalk bombings.  However, without proof of identity of those involved in the bombing, it is difficult to prove or disprove collusion in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">At this point in time, so many years on from the much desired and appreciated peace process, is it possible to develop a template to bring about reconciliation and forgiveness in the North?  One has only to listen to the family members of those who have been bereaved to understand that the need for truth is essential for healing.  The feeling that somebody knows something they are not divulging clearly prolongs the agony for families.  At a minimum, it seems to me that an evaluation of the truth and reconciliation formula in South Africa is obligatory.  Regarding the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa and its operation over a long period, I suppose people will argue that the circumstances in South Africa and in the North of Ireland are different in many respects.  In other respects, there are many similarities between the two and, at a minimum, we in this House should keep an open mind about the possible benefits of having a truth and reconciliation commission established for people who have been bereaved and who have had unexplained brutal murders visited on their families and on their circle of friends.  This offers the opportunity for them and perpetrators to come before the commission and explain the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Recently in Monaghan, just across the Border from south Armagh, the brutal murder of Paul Quinn occurred.  One need only attend some of the numerous public meetings being held and organised by members of the local community in the area where he lived, Cullyhanna, and the wider area to appreciate the significant impact his murder had on the community as a whole.  One can only speculate on the divisiveness this has caused.  The perpetrators live in the community and neighbours of Paul live cheek by jowl with them and must meet and pass them on the road each day.  I cannot forget either the sadness visited on the Cooley Peninsula when the late Tom Oliver was brutally murdered.  I know his family well and I am aware of how they have been affected by his murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Dealing with these issues is part of the healing process.  I am concerned, however, that our approach is on a piecemeal basis, with no real comprehensive approach.  The down-off-the-shelf formula to suit every circumstance may not be readily available, but we need to look further than providing an inquiry here and there.  We need to consider the totality of the murders, beatings and terrorism visited on so many people over the period of the Troubles and get a structure in place that will allow bereaved people to come and get answers and find out the circumstances of the murder or bereavement they suffered.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_267" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_862">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I regret there was some criticism yesterday on the Order of Business of the terms under which we are taking this item.  The Taoiseach made a reasonable statement in that regard.  He also set the tone for this debate when he said the debate was on a matter of the greatest national importance.  He went on to say it was about a series of atrocities perpetrated on innocent people in our country, including the bombings of May 1994 in Dublin and Monaghan, which saw the greatest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.  The Taoiseach said the debate is about murder, pure and simple, responsibility for those murders, justice for victims and how victims and survivors were and are treated and that while it is certainly about the past, it is also about the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The Taoiseach was accurate in what he said and I support him in that.  It is vital we have this debate and that while we deal with some issues of the past, we also look forward.  This message was borne out for me several times recently.  When I was appointed by the Taoiseach as a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, an appointment I was pleased to accept, I was welcomed at my first meeting in Oxford by the joint chairpersons, our own Deputy Niall Blaney and Mr. Paul Murphy, the former Northern Secretary.  We spent some of the time at that session reminding ourselves, as Members from all the parliaments on these islands, that we had moved on from the past and from a time when people were killed and maimed and now need to look forward.  This very much sums up for me where we are at with regard to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The effect of the message also came home to me when I drove from Tallaght through the North in the autumn of last year to Armagh to act as a delegate to the SDLP conference.  I found my journey a remarkable experience, although some colleagues who travel that road often may not understand the effect it had on me.  I had not crossed the Border for some time and hesitated as I entered Keady, expecting to be stopped, but of course I was not.  Simple changes like that show how we have moved on.  It is important that in debates such as this we are not afraid to point out that things are more normal now.  There are still some who do not agree with our peaceful ideals and we must deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Deputy Crawford mentioned the terrible murder of Paul Quinn.  I spoke to a number of people about the murder at the SDLP conference and at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting.  I also raised Dáil questions on the matter.  I express my solidarity and sympathy to those affected by that horrendous murder.  I offer my sympathy to all the victims of violence over the past 30 odd years.  I appreciate the contact I have received from victims' families, including some in my constituency, in recent months.  It is only right that we articulate the concerns of these people and I would be happy to be part of that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The extent of the historic breakthrough that has been achieved in Northern Ireland is remarkable.  Since May 2007, we have shared devolved Government in Northern Ireland, commanding support from both communities and all political parties.  I am glad that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, representatives of two communities which had long held opposing visions for the North's constitutional future, are working together effectively in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.  I understand disagreements are worked out through negotiation and compromise.  It is clear that centuries-old divisions are being left behind, which is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I welcome in particular the establishment of the Consultative Group on the Past and the Northern Ireland Victims Commission, which was established by former British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain.  I am not sure whether I should send him good wishes, but all politicians should be sorry when they see another politician in some bother.  While not everyone will agree, he made a contribution.  I understand the purpose of the consultative group is to seek views from across the community on the best way to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.  The group is co-chaired by Lord Robin Eames and Denis Bradley, people we know well.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, have welcomed the establishment of the group.  The Government has consistently stated that dealing with the past is crucial and requires our ongoing attention.  It has also stressed the importance of wide consultation, as well as adequately addressing the needs of victims, something I support strongly.  The Taoiseach met the consultative group during its visit to Dublin last November.  I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs will meet the group as its work continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Many issues will fall under the remit of the group's agenda and I welcome two in particular.  There are always issues with regard to commemorations.  A constituent of mine, for example, contacts me regularly to suggest the famine should be commemorated, which is something I support.  I understand there is a proposal on the table for a day of remembrance or reflection, as suggested by the healing through remembering group.  This would be a worthwhile exercise and I hope it will be undertaken as a joint North-South initiative.  In my community and public life I have done much networking with Northern politicians and as a result I feel it is important we do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">There was a little criticism about this debate and how it is being handled.  I have listened to much of the debate here and feel it is right we in this Parliament should take the opportunity to voice our concerns about these matters.  Deputy Finian McGrath and I were members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights when the Barron report and other reports were furnished.  I sat through much of that horrendous evidence.  There are issues in the North but there are also issues in the South where there is a need for closure.  The Taoiseach was correct yesterday to put it up to the British Government again to do something about this.  I recall Paul Murphy, when he was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, delicately declining an invitation for him and his predecessors to appear before the justice committee.  That was a pity.  However, contacts in that regard should continue.  I am pleased to have had this opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_871">As a public representative for a Border area, representing a vast area close to Derry city, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I also welcome the opportunity to put on record how far we have come and the further journey we must make, probably a similar distance, to find truth and closure for the people and families who have lost loved ones.  The quest for truth and justice is paramount at this important juncture of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">In 1996 we were fortunate to have an extensive peace and reconciliation programme, in which all Governments and parties were involved, including Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  I also acknowledge the efforts of Sinn Féin, the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and Independents.  It was an ADM/CPA funded peace and reconciliation programme.  That was a first stage where communities could interface with each other and begin the journey of building trust by seeing they could be in the same room as people they perceived to be different in disposition and attitude.  I commend everybody involved in the peace and reconciliation programme through to PEACE II.  They were not just ambitious but also courageous people who decided to work on a cross-Border basis.  They worked hard and diligently bringing communities from different sides of the divide and different religious backgrounds together.  They brought the peace process to where it is today.  At community and grassroots level they created an interface that had not happened previously.  That built a platform and mechanism whereby the peace process could evolve, as it subsequently did.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">The next chapter of the peace process was the political ambition to get the Assembly up and running.  Fortunately, that did take place.  We believed it would happen but many of us still watch in disbelief the politicians from different poles of the political spectrum sitting and working together.  It is most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The next stage in the process is the most important, the quest for truth and justice.  This seeks to bring closure for families and campaigners who have worked vociferously and diligently to have independent investigations carried out to get to the truth about collusion among the security forces and terrorist organisations.  We must heed these representative groups and the individuals and families who have lost loved ones.  We have a political obligation and are accountable to these people.  If we do not get closure on activities that happened over the past 30 years, we will not evolve as a democratic society and the peace process will be derailed.  We must open some type of forum which people can enter safely, where the truth can be told and where proper information can be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I commend my party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, on taking a courageous step yesterday in terms of using the east-west plank of the Good Friday Agreement to secure the release of documentation and information on many examples of collusion over the past 30 years.  I represent Donegal North-East and today I received a telephone call, for the first time, from a member of the Fullerton family, Amanda Fullerton, about the murder of her father over 30 years ago.  It is an example of the maturity of spirit that exists in politics in Ireland at present that people are reaching out to all political parties in seeking the truth and getting investigations started into the murder of their loved ones.  Similarly, Deputy Seymour Crawford, who spoke earlier, lost a very close friend with the death of Billy Fox 30 years ago.  People such as Amanda Fullerton and Deputy Seymour Crawford are simply looking for the truth to be told and to overcome the insurmountable obstacles that were placed in their paths during the past turbulent 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Deputy Brendan Smith from the Border county of Cavan who is present today is a former co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  He was vociferous and proactive in working for a peace settlement.  Yesterday, the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body called for proposals and suggestions on how the body should move forward.  I do not wish to see the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body dissolve.  An element of trust has been built up over the years through the good work it has done.  The current co-chairman is Deputy Niall Blaney from my constituency.  It is important that we use the body proactively to explore how best to move forward in the quest for an international truth commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The body offers that unique opportunity.  It includes politicians from Scotland, Wales, England, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  My colleague, Deputy Arthur Morgan, shares a strong relationship with many of the politicians across the water.  In fact, only recently he shared a beer with Lord Dubbs in Oxfordshire.  It is an example of how this democracy has moved forward.  We should build upon that and use the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I seek support in this regard from Deputy Morgan and Deputy Brendan Smith who have strong relationships with current members of the body.  I notice that Deputy Pat Carey, another former Chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, has just come into the House.  A tremendous amount of trust has been built up with that organisation.  We should use it to explore the truth.  Perhaps we should consider establishing some form of commission, in line with international best practice.  We should look at what was done in places like South Africa before we debate the possibility of developing a similar structure.  The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body will not be moving forward if we do not have something to cling to.  I am sure the Ministers of State, Deputies Smith and Pat Carey, will agree in the context of a discussion on legacies that it would be wrong to allow good work that was done over the years in building trust within the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to dissipate.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I commend Robin Eames and Denis Bradley on the pivotal role they played in starting this process, particularly with their work on the Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland.  It is important that we keep them involved in this process, which is in its embryonic stages.  Their expertise could be used if we are to proceed with the proposal I have made in respect of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  It is important that Mr. Eames and Mr. Bradley meet the interparliamentary body at the earliest possible stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">Various groups like Justice for the Forgotten have been campaigning for years.  They possibly think they have been campaigning for too long.  They do not have a proper platform on which they can air their own suggestions.  This is not just a political process in which politicians try to make progress — it is important that representative groups and families are also involved in the debate at this juncture.  As I have already said, the peace process is at a watershed at this point.  Proper lines of communication should be kept open with each of the many people who have been affected by the Troubles.  At the same time, we have a duty to provide for accountability in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I wish to return to the initial point I made about the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  Its successor, PEACE ll, focused on the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  Funding opportunities are available to those who wish to explore the legacy of the conflict.  It is not a question of funding, as moneys and people with expertise are available to bring this forward.  All that is required is the actual political will.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he is willing to go the extra yard to move this process forward.  In fairness, we have not heard any proposals about how that might happen.  My party leader, Deputy Kenny, who is also willing to go the extra yard, has placed a great deal of emphasis on the third element of the Good Friday Agreement — the development of east-west bodies.  We cannot do this in an insular or self-determined way.  We cannot solve these problems on our own because they are shared by everybody in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland.  These issues do not affect people in small or parochial areas, such as the Border counties — they affect everybody.  It is important that we think thoroughly about the process we will undertake.  The only way to make progress is to bring everybody into the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">As politicians, we are obliged to get on with our day-to-day business.  We spend a great deal of our time reacting to events.  We tend to look two or more months down the line — at the next budget, for example.  We can facilitate proper procedures if we take the representative groups seriously.  The Government has a duty to invite such groups to address the Cabinet as well as forums like the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  The Taoiseach said he has met these people in his clinics in St. Luke's and elsewhere.  A proper mechanism is needed so these people can be heard.  I am not sure how that will happen.  Politicians should be guided by the experience and expertise of those who have been through the ordeal of campaigning for over 30 years.  We sometimes get carried away with ourselves and think we have all the answers.  We feel we have to tell those in the gallery and the electorate what they want to hear.  We all fall into that trap.  We need to tap into what people have learned from their experiences.  Those who have been looking for justice for over 30 years should be invited to participate in this debate.  We need to communicate with them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Rory O’Hanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_884">I recognise the input of the Taoiseach, who established the original investigations which led to the publication of the Hamilton report, the Barron report, the McEntee report and the Cory report.  The various investigative commissions, which did great work to bring us to where we are today, have produced excellent reports.  The conclusions in the fourth interim report confirmed what many of us living in Border areas knew for some time — that there was collusion in many of the atrocities.  A report published by an Oireachtas sub-committee states that there is "no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many if not all of the atrocities that are considered in this report".  That is obviously a matter of great concern.  The sub-committee states in its report that it dealt with 25 cases, involving 76 murders, and found evidence of collusion with the security forces in 24 of those cases, involving 74 murders.  As a representative of a Border area which is obviously close to counties like Armagh, Tyrone and Louth, I am concerned by the sub-committee's findings, particularly in relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">I recognise the contribution of Justice for the Forgotten and people like Don Mullen over many years.  It is encouraging that so much progress has been made at this stage.  However, it is a matter of concern to everyone in the House that the different commissions, the Oireachtas sub-committee and the Oireachtas joint committee, which is also entitled to some praise, were unable to conclude their work because they did not get the co-operation of the authorities in Britain.  It is not too late for those authorities to hand over their documents.  It would help to bring these investigations to a conclusion, satisfy the people and, above all, bring some comfort to the relatives and friends of the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">Some 3,700 people were killed and approximately 40,000 people were injured during the Troubles.  While we can look at individual atrocities, it is important that we recognise that every one of the atrocities in which those people were killed or injured was a tragedy for the relatives and friends of the deceased.  We must be sensitive to that when we select some cases for further examination.  It is important that we recognise that it does not matter which side of the community or the Border those who were killed and injured came from.  Recently, there was an appalling atrocity in my constituency.  A young man, Paul Quinn, was beaten to death with iron bars and it is alleged that the perpetrators came from County Armagh.  This murder has rightly been condemned by all Members of the House and all decent people outside the House.  It is important that people who have information about this crime, of whom there must be many, go to the Garda or to the PSNI.  This is not just so that the Quinn family can have some closure in this tragic situation but also because it is important, particularly for the people of County Armagh and for those of Ireland, that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">We gratefully recognise the establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and the progress that has been made over the years and we look forward to a much more normal society in which people can live.  However, it is important for the victims of the many atrocities that have taken place and for their families, relatives and friends that we bring closure to these cases.  This can be achieved, from the point of view of today's discussion on the Barron report, if the British Government comes forward and gives the information it has in its possession.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretConlon" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_888">I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Like my constituency colleague, I too come from a Border county, where the Troubles, and this event in particular, have had a major impact.  As has been said, the terrible atrocities that took place in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974 represented the greatest loss of human life in any single day during the Troubles.  For me it is a vague memory, but unfortunately for the survivors and the victims' families the memory is all too clear.  I am disgusted and horrified that collusion took place.  It is evident that the British Government has indeed frustrated attempts to obtain the truth about these and similar incidents for which there is credible evidence of collusion.  There cannot be true closure for the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings until the full truth about collusion comes to the surface and responsibility is apportioned.  This must no longer be swept under the carpet.  Somebody must be held accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">It is a bit rich for the British Government to take a strong and vociferous stand on international terrorism while remaining mute on the issue of its former State-sponsored terrorism in the form of collusion.  As Mr. Justice Barron noted, the value of his report "was reduced by the [British Government's] reluctance to make original documents available and the refusal to supply other information on security grounds."  I request that all documentation and information of the British state be made available to allow, once and for all, a truly complete report on collusion.  If this does not happen, the issue will follow the British Government for ever until it eventually releases the documents.  It should do this for the sake of the survivors and the families and in view of the current era of political accommodation, with co-operation taking place between the DUP and Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I concur with the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights sub-committee on the Barron report that a historical inquiries team be established to investigate unresolved crimes connected with the Troubles and that this link up with a similar body in Northern Ireland.  I believe and hope this will be recommended by the Eames-Bradley Consultative Group on the Past.  I welcome the clear intention of this group to tackle collusion.  It is also important that a full and independent inquiry be established into the murder of Pat Finucane.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Although progress is slow, it is taking place.  For example, last week's announcement of the establishment of four victims commissioners for Northern Ireland to work on behalf of victims and survivors is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge the work of my constituency colleague, the late John Wilson, as a victims commissioner and of Nuala O'Loan, whose tireless work as Police Ombudsman did a lot to instil Nationalist confidence in the North's new police force.  In recent times we have witnessed the co-operation of the Garda Síochána in the murder investigation following the death of Paul Quinn in my constituency, which is a welcome advance and which I hope will bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Although these are all progressive steps, the British Government's current intransigence prevents closure for the survivors and the victims' families.  As a Government TD, I call on the British Government to provide this closure.  It is necessary to realise that those affected by the tragedies are entitled to the truth.  We have come a long way since 1974, but the memory of this terrible event lives on in the minds of the survivors and the victims' families.  They must no longer be forgotten.  They have a right to truth and justice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity of speaking on this very important debate on violent incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland.  I wish to use this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families.  As part of the healing process they deserve truth, openness and, above all, justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">I was a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights sub-committee on the Barron report.  The oral and written submissions had a tremendous impact on all the sub-committee members.  I took a minority view and supported the calls of the family members for a full public inquiry.  I thank and commend all those who spoke at our hearings.  Today I will focus my views on that report and, in particular, on the issue of collusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">There are some in this State and in other jurisdictions who wish to walk away from this issue, but I have no intention of turning my back or staying silent in the face of strong evidence that the British security forces were involved in collusion.  We owe it to the victims, their families, our citizens and future generations.  The reality is that the conflict in the North, which continued for more than 30 years, was a dirty war.  The only way to ensure that these or similar actions do not happen on this island ever again is to send out a strong, clear message that such actions will not go unchecked.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">I wish to highlight the strong findings of the sub-committee on the fourth Barron report, which explicitly acknowledged the reality of British security force collusion in criminal activities in this jurisdiction.  Collusion is a separate, discrete facet of the Northern conflict that needs to be specifically addressed by this House, and I share the concerns expressed yesterday about the absence of the word "collusion" in the original statement.  I also support the idea of putting a motion to the House for debate on which we can all agree.  We owe it to the families and to those who genuinely want truth and justice.  I emphasise that these are governmental findings and that the committee requested the guidance of the House on the actions to be taken with regard to these findings.  The Taoiseach, in his speech at the unveiling of the memorial to the Miami Showband last month, acknowledged the clear evidence of collusion by the security forces in many of these murders, as has been made clear in several reports over the years, and reiterated the Government's support for the families in their quest for answers.  We will take another step when there is a full debate in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">These issues demand and deserve the attention of our national Parliament.  We must ask ourselves what steps must be taken.  Today I propose a step.  I call on the British Government, as a sign of its good faith in dealing with the legacy of the Northern conflict, to provide access to all documents relating to atrocities in this jurisdiction which are currently being withheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">On a more general level, I note that the issue of collusion is more significant now than at any time for many years, with the British Government appointing the independent Eames-Bradley Consultative Group on the Past to make recommendations on the legacy of the past.  Members of the group have stated that they saw the Stevens archive on collusion and were deeply shocked by it.  I say again that they were deeply shocked by it.  What will come out is worse than many people think.  The group will make its report to the British Government in June 2008 and has made clear that recommendations regarding British responsibility for collusion and criminal activities will be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The report of the Barron sub-committee contained the following important conclusions:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_900">The sub-committee was left in no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many if not all of the atrocities that were considered in this report.  It was horrified that persons who were employed by the British administration to preserve peace and to protect people were engaged in the creation of violence and the butchering of innocent victims.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_901">The sub-committee believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there cannot be closure for the families.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_902">The sub-committee further believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there is always the risk of what occurred in the 1970s occurring again some day.  We are of the view that these matters cannot be swept under the carpet.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_903">The sub-committee is of the view that given that we are dealing with acts of international terrorism that were colluded in by the British security forces, the British Government cannot legitimately refuse to co-operate with investigations and attempts to get to the truth.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_904">The sub-committee notes that the British Cabinet was aware of the level to which the security forces had been infiltrated by terrorists and we believe that its inadequate response to this knowledge permitted the problem to continue and to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">The sub-committee has the support of all Members of this House.  The sub-committee has no doubt that there was collusion between members of the British security forces and loyalist paramilitaries and that this was known at Cabinet level.  The British Government has frustrated attempts to get to the truth about these and other incidences where there was credible evidence of collusion.  This debate is an opportunity for the Irish Government to put pressure on the British Government to help those bereaved as a result of collusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">Our Government should at least call on the British Government as an act of good faith to make all original files which may relate to the issues inquired into by Mr. Justice Barron accessible to the appropriate bodies in our jurisdiction.  This would show the British Government is genuine in its support of the peace process and, more importantly, of the families of those murdered as a result of collusion.  I want to send a strong message to the British Government that these acts should not have been allowed to happen in the past and will not be allowed to happen again.  In the words of our sub-committee: "What occurred in respect of these atrocities must, quite simply, never ever be allowed to happen again".  The only way to ensure that these or similar actions do not happen in this island again is to send a clear message that these actions will not go unchecked.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I commend Justice for the Forgotten, the Pat Finucane Centre and the Fay, Finucane, O'Neill and other families for their work, courage and dignity in their search for truth.  I will always support them to the bitter end.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_908">I wish to share time with Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this issue, particularly as I had requested a debate several times from the Government on this issue.  I am not happy that the format is a series of statements rather than a debate on a motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Many terrible, unforgivable atrocities were committed in the name of Ireland and Ulster over 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.  The violence occasionally spilled over into this jurisdiction.  In many cases, nobody was brought to justice for those atrocities and many relatives still grieve for the loss of loved ones and the absence of answers.  Various paramilitary organisations, loyalist and nationalist, waged a vile sectarian war and were responsible for the majority of the incidents where 3,500 people lost their lives.  We should recognise that the overwhelming majority of the security forces in both jurisdictions were honourable men and women, many of whom lost their lives in efforts to protect the civilian population from the violence of paramilitaries.  The atrocities that are the subject of this debate are of particular significance to us because they are among the worst of the Troubles, they occurred in this jurisdiction and there is strong evidence of collusion between those who carried them out and members of the security forces in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">It is important that we express our gratitude to Mr. Justice Barron for undertaking his four inquiries, making his reports and his co-operation with the justice sub-committee.  The work was arduous and demanding and was undertaken in a painstaking, methodical and impartial way.  The sub-committee, the public and members of the families affected understand that, notwithstanding the serious limitations that surrounded the process, the results added to our understanding of the events he examined.  He particularly highlighted the outstanding issues that still face us.  In the words of the final report from the sub-committee: "It should be remembered that all of the Barron reports have been frustrated by the absence of any real co-operation from the British security forces."</p>
          <p eId="para_912">We are talking about a period during which there was systematic collusion between state security forces and unlawful paramilitary organisations.  In its last report, the sub-committee summarised the position as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_913">The sub-committee is left in no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many if not all of the atrocities that are considered in this report.  We are horrified that persons who were employed by the British administration to preserve peace and to protect people were engaged in the creation of violence and the butchering of innocent victims.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_914">The sub-committee believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there cannot be closure for the families.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_915">The sub-committee further believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there is always the risk of what occurred in the 1970s occurring again some day...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_916">The sub-committee is of the view that given that we are dealing with acts of international terrorism that were colluded in by the British security forces, the British Government cannot legitimately refuse to co-operate with investigations and attempts to get to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">It is against this background that the Labour Party protested so strongly yesterday at the Taoiseach's decision that the Dáil should confine itself to a series of statements on this issue, rather than debating and approving any concrete steps to move the matter forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that we should debate a motion.  It is a pity that Deputies who today say we should debate a motion did not take the opportunity yesterday of voting with the Labour Party's proposal that we should have a motion.  Instead, the Taoiseach said he considers this a debate where we can express our views and that whether it is structured as statements, a debate or a motion is a technical point.  There are more than enough people in a position to make statements such as statements of sympathy with families or concern on State actions.  More is expected from Dáil Éireann and the Government that is answerable to this House than statements.  The people concerned are entitled to expect action.  The series of sub-committee reports on which we are making statements contain specific recommendations for action by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government, yet we are refused the opportunity to endorse those reports or approve their recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The first report stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_920">3. The sub-committee considers that a public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act 1921 in this jurisdiction would have represented the preferred form of inquiry.  However, because the perpetrators, information and witnesses are outside of this jurisdiction, there are legal and procedural difficulties arising from an inquiry initiated in this jurisdiction as set out previously.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_921">4. The sub-committee considers that a public tribunal of inquiry in Northern Ireland and-or Great Britain is required and represents the best opportunity to be successful.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_922">5. Before any inquiry would proceed the sub-committee is of the view that what is required in the first instance, is an investigation based upon the Weston Park proposals.  The terms of reference should be agreed between the two Governments and should be based upon the terms agreed at Weston Park, in particular paragraph No. 19.  The letter of instruction to Mr. Justice Peter Cory and the relevant portion of the Weston Park protocol is at Appendix 11.  The sub-committee recommends that such an investigation be conducted on the following basis:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_923">(i) That the judge conducting the investigation be of international stature.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_924">(ii) That the investigation would have the power to direct witnesses for interview, the power to compel the delivery of documentation and to inspect premises.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_925">(iii) That there should be time limits agreed for the commencement, duration and conclusion of the investigation.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_926">(iv) That the judge conducting the investigation could recommend further action including whether a public inquiry in either jurisdiction should be held or not.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_927">(v) The relevant government would be obliged to implement any recommendation within a defined time limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">It went on to recommend that, if that process failed, the Irish Government should consider instituting proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It recommended specifically that a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas be passed, endorsing the report and its recommendations and inviting the UK Parliament at Westminster to pass a similar resolution.  We are not being given that opportunity.  Therefore, at the very least, if we are to live up to the expectations of those who wrote and read the reports, the House should pass a resolution receiving, endorsing and approving the reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">Second, as recommended, our presiding officer, the Ceann Comhairle, should be instructed to inform the Speaker of the House of Commons of these facts and to send copies of the relevant reports, and other documents, with a request that the matter be considered by the Members of that House.  Third, we should formally call on the Taoiseach to renew his efforts to secure the agreement of the British Government to the course of action recommended by the sub-committee and to report to the Dáil on a regular, comprehensive and timely basis.  Finally, we should resolve that if there is no progress of substance on these issues, the Government should report to this House on the steps it will take to institute proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Anything less than such a basic course of action is just lip-service to the survivors and relatives of what the late Mr. John Wilson described as "some of the bloodiest and most chilling days" of the whole period of the Troubles.  Those survivors and relatives have been relentless in their commitment to finding the truth.  The Government should help them and this House should have been given the opportunity to instruct it accordingly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_931">I was a member of the Oireachtas sub-committee which dealt with the final report from Mr. Justice Barron.  I listened to the stories of the relatives and some survivors and it was a time that will change every one of us forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The reports by the Oireachtas Joint Committee into collusion between the British security forces and loyalist paramilitary organisations relating to a series of murders during the 1970s are extremely shocking and disturbing.  Even taking into consideration the context of the era, the extent of collusion is much greater than many would have assumed existed prior to these investigations.  I share the views expressed yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Joe Costello, that the British Government must now co-operate fully with all investigations into these atrocities.  Its continued refusal to co-operate with these investigations prevents the full truth from emerging.  The picture that emerges of the level of collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries is shocking, with repeated references to information not being shared, information being withheld and a lack of co-operation between security forces in Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána on this side of the Border who were attempting to investigate these incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The families of those killed have campaigned for years to find out the truth about the circumstances that led to the deaths of their loved ones.  Throughout that time, their firm belief and insistence that there was security force involvement in these killings was often disregarded or blatantly ignored.  However, that will not happen any longer because all the reports confirm what they believed in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee which conducted the hearings and compiled the fourth and final report on Mr. Justice Barron's investigations.  Overall, we were left in no doubt that there was collusion between members of the British security forces and loyalist paramilitaries and that this was known at the very highest level in Whitehall.  There should be no misapprehension about the role of the Barron commission or the Dáil hearings.  They were not public inquiries and were never intended to be regarded as such.  As emphasised by the committee chairman, Deputy Seán Ardagh, the purpose of the Dáil hearings was to draw lessons from the Barron exercise and decide whether further action was warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">If I, as someone who sat on the committee, am really frustrated and annoyed, I can only imagine what the relatives of the victims and survivors are feeling today.  This debate is simply further adding to their list of questions.  The main question now being added to that list is where do we go from here?  There is no conclusion to what is being done here today.  There is no stepping further.  None of the recommendations of the committee is being dealt with and there is no action planned for the future.  This issue is not closed.  Just as for the past 30 years, these people will not go away.  They will insist on closure and on knowing all there is to know.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Clearly the level of implementation of the recommendations in the various reports has been totally unsatisfactory to date.  Ten years of formal Government and Parliament sponsored investigations, reports and recommendations since the establishment of the initial Victims Commission in 1998 must be acted on.  However, there appears to be no way that we can move forward from this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Persistent reports of collusion also demand that Britain opens its files to scrutiny.  While its track record in the murky world of espionage makes co-operation unlikely, the Government must use its close relationship with the British Government to ensure evidence of collusion is shown the light of day.  While credit can be given to the British Government for introducing reforms, and particularly for the establishment of the historical inquiries team, under the PSNI, it does not meet international standards for investigation.  Furthermore, what is most annoying is the fact that its findings will not be published.  The committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is scrutinising British compliance with several judgments of the European Court of Human Rights relating to Northern Ireland.  However, despite these developments, the serious concerns and unanswered questions of those affected by past collusion have not been addressed adequately, if at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">For many years, the relatives of the victims have felt they have been abandoned, misled and marginalised.  After 30 years of despair, it is imperative that our Government insists that the British Government puts these atrocities, which claimed so many lives, under the penetrating searchlight of the public gaze.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">There is no need for us to sympathise with the people in the Visitors Gallery today.  There is no need for us to tell them what happened.  They know, they were there, they lived it.  They relive it every day.  What they want from us is to know how they will get closure.  They are not getting closure as a result of this process.  We should take seriously the recommendations of the committee and put them in place.  We should deal with this as one sovereign Government to another.  The days are long gone when we tread on eggshells for fear of bringing everything down around our ears.  We must say to the British Government that these people deserve to know and we, as a Government, demand to know.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">The Good Friday Agreement acknowledges that "We must never forget those who have died or have been injured, and their families".  As someone who has, with my colleagues in the Green Party, consistently campaigned for truth and reconciliation, including calling for investigations into collusion and a debate on collusion in both Houses of the Oireachtas, I welcome the fact that this debate has eventually come about.  I hope that the debate adds political impetus to the investigation of collusion and to the identification of measures to bring closure to victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">I regret that this debate is not specifically on the issue of collusion and that there is no motion before the House. My contribution will focus on collusion, which is a fundamental human rights issue for victims and their relatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">It is very important that the concerns arising from this and other reports are widely understood.  I support the Government's efforts, and urge that such efforts continue, to impress upon the British Government that it must examine the findings of the Barron, Oireachtas sub-committee and MacEntee inquiries.  The British Government must address the issues raised by these reports, including by full disclosure of information as highlighted by Mr. Justice Barron.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">A significant number of the 3,700 murders remain unsolved and families on both sides of the Border still have no explanation as to why their loved ones were snatched away from them so cruelly.  Justice needs to be served.  Every effort must be made to uncover the truth for these families to provide them with some closure on the terrible events of the past 40 years.  We are reminded today by the presence of representatives of Justice for the Forgotten and others that the turmoil of the past 40 years was not confined to the Six Counties.  The greatest loss of life in a single day of the Troubles occurred on Friday, 17 May 1974 when 34 people were killed in four separate explosions in Dublin and Monaghan.  Approximately 258 people were injured in the blasts, with many continuing to suffer to this day.  I was on Abbey Street, one of the many people in the centre of Dublin on that day and I felt the blast like hundreds of others, but we were spared the injuries suffered by many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Bereaved families and survivors of the 1974 bombings joined those affected by the Dublin bombings of 1 December 1972 and 20 January 1973 to ensure that their loved ones were not forgotten.  Their campaign led to the establishment by the Government in 2000 of the Barron and MacEntee commission of investigation.  Regrettably, important questions remain unanswered.  Many survivors and those who lost loved ones are still battling today, demanding to know the truth as to why their loved ones died.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland and the Historical Enquiries Team of the PSNI in reviewing past investigations have important roles to play.  Their work is difficult, painstaking and often frustrating.  They must rebuild memories, locate papers and challenge accepted wisdoms, and that could perhaps reopen the scars of that troubled time.  They can uncover disturbing truths.  Both offices have been subject to criticisms, some valid and some unfair.  However, the importance of shining a light on events, if just to say how someone died or to return personal belongings kept in evidence, cannot be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The Consultative Group on the Past under the chairmanship of Lord Robin Eames and Mr. Denis Bradley has been tasked by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to see whether there is a consensus on how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.  There are myriad opinions on how best this can be achieved, but there is no single answer.  The group has cast a wide net in its attempt to listen to and incorporate as many voices as possible.  It has held private consultations and public meetings and its members have heard about people's pain.  They are talking to victims, their organisations, political parties, the two Governments, the security forces, paramilitaries, lawyers and others in gathering the thoughts, insights and emotions of all stakeholders, whether citizens or office holders, with a view to building a better future for Northern Ireland.  Members of the group are in attendance today and they have the Government's support for the difficult work they are undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">Victims' groups, including Justice for the Forgotten, have articulated various approaches to dealing with the past that I am sure are receiving close consideration.  One proposal was a recent call by a consortium of groups for the establishment of a truth commission.  This approach was advocated by the Green Party and I am pleased to see that it is being considered by the Consultative Group on the Past.  When the group makes its report to the British Government in June, I hope that whatever solution it recommends deals adequately with all aspects of the atrocities in question, including collusion.  A truth commission would be intended to prioritise the search for truth over the desire for retribution.  The group believes that the criminal justice system has frustrated the process of truth recovery.  It argues that fear of prosecution means that those who know the real story about the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan and many other atrocities that have scarred this island in the past 40 years will never come forward.  It articulates a process of individual and societal healing through an acknowledgment and a deeper understanding of the history of the Troubles.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Consideration of any such approach would need to be balanced against the desires of others to see justice done or to leave this possibility open should the necessary evidence be collected.  Progress would need to be contingent on respect for the law, including obligations under international law.  On this island, we have the potential for a good future, but to get there we cannot blind ourselves to the past.  We must ensure that the wounds of the Troubles are not allowed to fester because we need healing.  The announcement on Monday of the new Victims Commission for Northern Ireland was an important step forward and I wish the commissioners well as it begins its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The Good Friday Agreement states that building a peaceful and just society would be the true memorial to the victims of violence.  Addressing serious issues, including collusion, can contribute to building that society.  We owe it to the victims, to those who can no longer speak for themselves, to learn from the mistakes of the past so that we are not doomed to repeat them endlessly.  It is only right that we have this debate now.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanArdagh" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Deputy Seán Ardagh</from>
          <p eId="para_951">In reading through the literature related to this debate, I noted that it has been 40 years since the start of the Troubles.  It was in October that the first marches occurred and the North's civil rights groups started their actions.  The British army then unleashed its power and weapons and the Troubles started.  I am delighted that, 40 years later, there is a peaceful, prosperous and shared society in Northern Ireland and a working Northern Executive and that our Government and the Northern Executive work well together.  It is a change-about.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The one matter that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the first day of the committee hearings on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  In the committee room downstairs, the victims and relatives of victims gave their first-hand accounts of what occurred on that day and what has occurred in the 35 years since.  It has been seven or eight years since those hearings commenced, but I remember distinctly Charlie Bird on the 6 o'clock news on RTE.  It was riveting television.  The members of the committee, including Deputy Costello, were stunned into silence by the harrowing stories told to us that day.  The people in question have remembered those events not just for 35 years, but up to today.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">I welcome the Taoiseach's comments yesterday on the Order of Business that he was prepared to accept a motion put to the Dáil and agreed among all party Whips.  I hope they will make every effort to agree a wording on the question of collusion between the perpetrators of the violence and the British security forces.  It is important that this work be done behind the scenes so that an agreed motion can be developed in the House and put without replaying the entire debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Mr. Justice Hamilton began the inquiry, Mr. Justice Barron continued it and four reports have been made on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Dublin bombings, the murder of Seamus Ludlow in Dundalk, Kay's Tavern and many other atrocities.  As we went from report to report, it became more fixed in my mind.  Initially, I was unsure and I accepted the possibility that there was no collusion, but as reports came one after the other, it became fixed in my mind that there was collusion between British security forces and the perpetrators of some of those dastardly crimes.  I would not claim that it was in an overt manner, but it certainly occurred through a nod, a wink and turning a blind eye.  Sections of the British establishment took the view that whatever their intended end justified the means.  Why was full co-operation not given to Mr. Justice Barron by the Northern Ireland Office when he sought it more than once?  This co-operation would have included the files of MI6, MI5 or whoever the British security forces in the Northern Ireland Office comprised.  These security forces were not prepared to allow the files to be seen by Mr. Justice Barron, which, in itself, indicated that there was something to hide.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">We found that members of the security forces in the North were engaged in these terrorist activities in the Republic.  It is inconceivable that the colleagues and superiors of these people were not aware that these men were involved.  A blind eye was turned to many of their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I thank the members of the sub-committees, all of which I had the privilege and honour of chairing.  Deputy Joe Costello was very much an active participant in all those hearings.  A number of people, including Deputy Finian McGrath, were also involved in those hearings, but one person I must name is Senator Jim Walsh, who took a very active role in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">These inquires would not have happened unless the Taoiseach had at the beginning asked John Wilson to act as the Victims Commissioner.  He produced a report and recommended that an inquiry be held into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the other bombings I mentioned.  Again, the Taoiseach ensured, and the Government agreed, that first Mr. Justice Hamilton and then Mr. Justice Barron would continue with those inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">The sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights received full co-operation from all of the gardaí and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach.  In addition, the Taoiseach attended a meeting of the sub-committee and answered questions on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Mr. Paddy MacEntee SC looked at some matters as part of the first commission of investigation set up under the Commissions of Investigation Act.  I know that Deputy Costello was the justice spokesperson at the time.  The Commissions of Investigation Act, which was very useful legislation, went through our committee.  It was the first time this Act was used and it was used effectively.  It is a template for further use in the future, probably in place of tribunals, but that is another day's work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_962">While I welcome any opportunity to raise the issue of collusion, highlight the predicament of the families and recognise their huge effort in campaigning for justice, information and, above all, truth, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, and members of the Labour Party that it would have been much more constructive to have an agreed motion before the House and to have a debate around it.  This motion should have contained some firm direct action as a follow-on to the statements expressed this afternoon and yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">However, these statements have again seen agreement across the parties in the Oireachtas that the British Government has failed to co-operate with inquiries established by the Oireachtas into attacks in this State, including mass murder, in which there is overwhelming evidence of direct or indirect involvement by British state forces.  Two years ago, we unanimously called on the British Government to establish an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  This was no small matter.  This was the democratic Parliament of this State speaking with one voice and demanding that the British Government establish an inquiry into one of the most serious crimes any Government can commit, namely, the murder of a person under its jurisdiction by its forces.  The British Government, first under Tony Blair and now under Gordon Brown, has refused the call of this Oireachtas and refused to establish this inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">We now need to know what efforts have been made by the Government led by the Taoiseach to press this issue with the British Government.  We also need to know what real action the Taoiseach has taken in an effort to prise information about collusion from the British Government.  He has repeatedly claimed that he raises these matters every time he meets the British Prime Minister but is that it?  For example, are all British MPs even aware that the Dáil and the Seanad have made this call?  Have copies of all relevant reports, including those by Mr. Justice Barron, been sent to the British Parliament and have MPs been informed of their existence?  Have there been meetings with party leaders and have key parliamentarians been lobbied?</p>
          <p eId="para_965">The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, stated earlier that these statements give us the opportunity to consider what further action can be taken.  It is a pity the Government did not convene a meeting of all parties before these statements and agree a motion proposing such action.  We could then have had a real debate and a productive outcome.  The Government can make amends for mishandling this matter by meeting with parties in the coming days and agreeing a motion to be put before the Seanad, which is also due to have a debate on collusion.  That motion can then return here and we can proceed with a plan of action.  The survivors and relatives of the victims of collusion deserve a serious and concerted approach that goes beyond simply stating our views.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">One case where we cannot simply blame the British Government for not enabling us to achieve significant closure is the case of Seamus Ludlow, who was murdered in County Louth.  Much of the missing information relating to that case lies in Garda files in this State.  The Taoiseach could order a full public inquiry this afternoon.  Why does he not do so?  Perhaps this is where he should start his quest for assistance for the families of the bereaved.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Reference has been made to the Consultative Group on the Past.  I take this opportunity to put on record my position and that of my party on the work of that body and the various proposals which have been flagged.  The British Government cannot credibly establish a mechanism for dealing with the past which is capable of commanding sufficient truth or credibility, whatever the virtues or good intentions of those involved in a consultative group which it has appointed.  The British Government's handling of this issue has consistently resulted in adding to the pain and suffering of this large constituency of people.  This inevitably results from the fact that the British Government is not neutral.  This was most clearly evidenced in the Bloomfield report.  This report gave "special consideration" to members of the British security agencies who lost their lives during the conflict and devoted a mere two paragraphs to the people killed by these same agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Some families have spent decades in pursuit of the truth, coming up against one closed door after another.  In only a few instances have inquiries been conceded.  Even in these few cases, new obstacles and delays are still a fact of life.  In the vast majority of cases, however, those who have lost loved ones have been pointedly denied the truth.  In fact, every effort imaginable has been made to hide and obscure what happened to the many hundreds of people killed directly by British state forces in collusion with their proxies in the Unionist paramilitary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">This cannot be allowed to continue.  Political posturing and self-interest cannot be an obstacle to moving the situation forward.  All of us have responsibility to create the circumstances in which the needs of all victims are met.  Sinn Féin is committed to finding a way forward.  We accept that dealing with the legacy issues is an onerous task.  However, it is of crucial importance that the past is dealt with and a mechanism found which treats all victims equally and allows families of victims an avenue of acknowledgement, apology and, above all, truth.  We are keen to assist in such a process.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">A firm motion proposing a series of actions, following a debate in this House, would have been more efficacious in achieving what the families most desire.  When we look across the incidents in this State, at Kay's Tavern, Dublin and Monaghan, I have no doubt the families of the victims of these atrocities are as hurt today as they were on the day of the incidents.  Each of us must do what we can to bring truth to these people.  Reference was made to working with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in trying to achieve progress in this matter.  There are many agencies that could contribute substantially to achieve truth, not just in the case of collusion but beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">First, there is work to be done in this House.  We must deal with the incidents that occurred in this State.  It is crucial and I hope the Government will change its mind, return after a motion in the Seanad and put the motion to this House for further debate.  That is a mechanism to move this forward and to give the families most affected by these atrocities in this State an opportunity to get truth and closure.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_972">In the context of the peace process, the handling of the legacy of the past is crucial.  In Northern Ireland, the appointment of the Eames-Bradley group, as well as some recently appointed victims commissioners, was not free of controversy.  I congratulate the members of the sub-committee on the vast volume of work over a long period.  When I was in the Seanad I spoke with my colleague Senator Jim Walsh and I know how much work went into it.  I am sure that is true of all members, including Deputy Costello.  The committee members had to sift through the Barron report and hold hearings.  This shows that the State and the Government has gone to considerable lengths to try to clarify issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">All of us share deep sympathy with the families of the victims who, in the vast majority of cases, were simply blown apart on a certain day without warning.  Those wounds do not heal over a lifetime and going through these reports there is a strong desire for the search for truth, knowledge of what happened and why it happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">All the attacks have in common that they were carried out from Northern Ireland, mostly at a time when co-operation between the two jurisdictions was limited, certainly more so than at present.  Relationships between governments could be strained at times and these were periods of high tension.  The violence in the North reached its peak in 1971-76.  I remember seeing the events of the 1972 and 1974 bombings on the television in Tipperary.  I had the feeling that if the perpetrators managed to escape across the Border without being apprehended there would not be much more to do that was in the power of this State.  We must remember that there was no extradition at the time and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, which might have allowed reciprocal prosecution across borders, did not exist until the end of 1976.  The State and its organs were chary of demanding too much of counterparts north of the Border because facilities such as hot pursuit, questioning and handing over suspects would be requested in return.  In this State, public opinion was at a certain state, far removed from the present position.  It is important, particularly in sensitive matters such as security, that there is a broad consensus as far as possible among the vast majority of the population on what the State and the Government is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">An unfortunate feature of some of these cases is that many official papers have been lost or removed.  Frankly, I do not know which.  Those who have not worked in Departments underestimate the vast quantities of paper that were generated, particularly in the pre-electronic age, even in non-sensitive matters.  As a young civil servant I had the experience of having great difficulty in retrieving files on non-sensitive issues, even if they were only two or three years old.  One lesson I hope has been long since applied is the need to improve the archiving of Government papers, especially those relating to any matter that is particularly important and sensitive.  That includes murders, terrorist attacks and so on.  One of these reports suggests that perhaps it was because files were put in a special place that they became lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Notwithstanding the vast improvement in intergovermental relations, I deeply regret a recurring feature in these matters over the period is the very limited, not to say minimalist co-operation, from the British Government.  I interpret this as an attitude of the British Government, its senior officials and security authorities, not to be prepared to lift the lid on the methods used to fight the war.  They might have officially called it something different but for those involved, fighting the war was effectively what they saw themselves as doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">We know there was considerable infiltration of and relationships with paramilitary groups, especially but not exclusively, loyalist ones.  The question arises as to what extent they were used as proxies to fight the war.  The British Army came to Northern Ireland from various colonial engagements in Aden, Cyprus and Malaysia where it was able to do very much what it liked with minimal scrutiny back home.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Earlier this week I saw an interesting film, "Charlie Wilson's War", set during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.  It claims to be based on a true story of how certain American agencies provided the Afghan mujahidin with the equipment with which they were able to claim victory in that conflict.  In theory, the mujahidin won the war but the film made it obvious it was because of American aid.  An open question in my mind is to what extent loyalist paramilitaries were used to hit targets, communities and intimidate this State through attacks and bombs.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">The timing of the 1972 Dublin bombs changed the outcome of a division in this House.  The then Government was on the point of falling but after the bombs went off the outcome of the division was different.  One can argue this was pure coincidence but I do not believe so.  At the time I believed — and still do —  that they had a political intent.  The question is what was that intent.  However, one can only speculate about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974 must be seen in the context of the struggle to bring down the Sunningdale Executive reaching its climax.  There is no doubt they were intended to deter this State in all sorts of ways.  From a Unionist and loyalist point of view, an Irish dimension in northern affairs was a no-go area.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">When I worked with Fianna Fáil in Opposition in the mid-1990s, a former member of the northern security forces — but from Northern Ireland, not from Britain — gave me details which I noted and subsequently supplied to the secretariat of the Department of the Taoiseach for fitting into the Barron inquiry.  The information I was given was not very different from versions given to several other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">The question arises as to whether British operatives fitted into a larger context.  We know the British Labour Government of 1974 to 1979 was deeply unpopular with right-wing elements in Britain, including the intelligence services.  It has been suggested this could be seen as the wider context to the bombings.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">During the past ten years I have the sense the British Government's control of its security services is limited.  There is the famous remark by the Queen, a very well-informed individual, about shadow forces in the country of which we know nothing.  Did the British Government know or want to know about these events?</p>
          <p eId="para_984">There was the disgraceful episode of collusion, referred to by the last speaker, relating to the murder of Pat Finucane.  I am glad the public career of the British Minister of State who made disgraceful comments in the House of Commons at the time did not prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">We must keep an open mind on these matters.  More evidence will come to light but there must be pressure for this to happen.  We must encourage those concerned to tell their stories and not to take secrets to the grave.  There were lessons from that period.  The Government was not intimidated by threats of loyalist attacks.  I recall in the mid-1990s being given a list of targets in Dublin which I promptly passed to the then Department of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">We have an important duty to ensure any misconceptions or myths about what the then Government was about are dispelled as quickly as possible in case they form a basis for attacking people.  I commend the reports and after the debate further consideration must be given in how this process can be carried forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_989">Yesterday was the 35th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.  How many of us in this House remember what we were doing when we heard the awful news from Derry?  If our memories of the events of 30 January 1973 remain sharp, I can only imagine how deep emotions run in families that mourn lost loved ones.  I speak of the families of the victims of the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings, of the Miami Showband, and of the families bereaved on days like Bloody Friday, or in places such as Kingsmill, Loughinisland or Enniskillen, where terrible deeds were done.  I speak of all those touched in whatever way by the long catalogue of murders and attacks which marked a low point in the history of this island.  So many paid a heavy price in death, injury and loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">Death and suffering visited my home town of Dundalk.  I remember it as a teenager and in my 20s.  The bombing of Kay's Tavern just before Christmas 1975 and the murder of Seamus Ludlow barely six months later are still remembered across the community in my area.  In particular, their families remember.  I have seen their grief, their loss, and heard their demand that wider society listen to and recognise the families' experiences.  The State failed them in the 1970s.  The previous Government at my request included the Dundalk bombing as part of the Barron remit and I am delighted that it was readily accepted.  I hope the work of Mr. Justice Barron and the Oireachtas committee, and the ongoing follow-up by the Government will help give them the comfort they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">We can never bring back what they have lost, but we can show solidarity with all those who suffered loss as a result of the conflict.  Those who suffered as a result of collusion have their own grief mirrored by the grief of other families who have suffered not perhaps because of collusion.  They include families like the families of Robert McCartney and Frank Kerr, who was murdered in 1994 in Newry.  The finest tribute we can pay is to redouble our commitment to the creation of a better future for everyone on this island, regardless of kith or kin.  To get there, it is clear that there needs to be engagement with the painful lessons and legacy of the past.  I do not underestimate this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Deputies referred to the late John Wilson, in his capacity as Victims' Commissioner.  His 1999 report, A Place and a Name, which was very aptly titled, not only describes the often difficult situation of survivors, but also recommended how some of their needs might be addressed.  John took a great personal interest in individual cases, using the experience he gained as a Deputy to help victims secure what they were due.  It was he who recommended the establishment of a remembrance commission, whose remit the Government recently extended.  He also played his part in the search for the disappeared through his membership of the Commission for the Location of Victims Remains.  That commission has of course yet to finish its work, and too many families have yet to have the comfort of burying their missing loved ones.  Over the years since becoming Minister and before I have met people who have suffered from the Troubles.  Of them all my heart goes out in particular to those who are not yet able to able to bury their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The report, A Place and a Name, gave direction and impetus to further inquiry into particular cases arising from the conflict.  This was taken forward in the work of the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton and Mr. Justice Henry Barron in the Independent Commission of Inquiry, and by Mr. Paddy MacEntee in his investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Their reports shine a light on many violent incidents whose effects had for too long been compounded by confusion and misinformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">I pay tribute to Deputy Seán Ardagh, who spoke earlier, and to all the members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, who meticulously advanced the work of Mr. Justice Barron and Mr. MacEntee.  They heard testimony from those whose lives were dramatically impacted by violence.  Many of their families, friends and advocates have been with us, in the Visitors Gallery, during this debate.  The committee dealt with issues which go to the heart of the democratic process — the failure by the state in its duty of care to its citizens.  This is an area where many questions remain unanswered, but face it we must if we are to be true to our responsibilities not only to those touched by the loss of loved ones, but also to the goal of better relations across communities and between these islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The findings of the Oireachtas committee that collusion occurred and that it was widespread are of the utmost seriousness.  The Taoiseach and I promptly ensured that copies of the reports of the Oireachtas committee were brought to the attention of the British Government.  We made clear that the findings regarding collusion were deeply troubling and a matter of serious concern.  We have consistently pressed the British Government to co-operate in the investigation of all these incidents.  Its response to date has been inadequate and unsatisfactory.  We continue to stress to the British Government the absolute importance of co-operation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I appreciate that there are many issues on all sides arising from the past.  I have consistently emphasised, not just as Minister for Foreign Affairs but as someone who saw the damage the Troubles inflicted on my home town of Dundalk, the very deep anxiety and widespread concerns arising from these reports and the need for the British Government to play its part in addressing these concerns, including the need for full disclosure, as highlighted by Mr. Justice Barron.  It is in everyone's interests to try now to secure closure with clarity in respect of these dark and troubling cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">Not only have the institutions in Northern Ireland been restored, but also there is a real prospect of the devolution of police and justice powers to the Executive.  This island is being transformed, by progressive steps, brave decisions, creative thinking and often painful exchanges.  As this change is embedded, through working institutions and increased trust between communities, the quarrel is becoming history.  However, just as we must learn the hard lessons of peace so that conflict on this island never happens again, we have a responsibility to share the insights of the peace process with others.  That was why I have established a conflict resolution unit in my Department.  Through this initiative, I believe that Ireland can make a distinctive and effective contribution to international peace making, peace building and lesson sharing.  The unit is leading the development of an Irish academic centre for conflict resolution, overseeing a stability fund, and will manage a system of roving ambassadors to crisis regions in the world to impart the practical know-how we garnered over decades during our own peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">We have achieved much, but the process is not over.  The success of the peace process will be measured ultimately by its effect on the lives of people.  In this House we often focus on the economic benefits of peace, the normalisation of relations and the landscape, and increased investment.  These are without doubt essential building blocks towards a better future.  However, people in Border areas frequently speak to me about the return to normal social contact which is the foundation of a healthy community.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Some of those who have impressed me most during my political career are those touched by the awful events we have been discussing today.  I have been moved by their embodiment of the power of the human spirit, by their bravery, their patience and their capacity to forgive.  They are in some cases taking the difficult, but important, step of engaging with neighbours, breaking a silence which may, for whatever reason, have endured for many years.  I acknowledge the tremendous dignity which victims of violence have displayed in the face of horrible adversity.  Many struggle to understand why things happened to them or to their loved one.  Some seek truth, others justice.  Some cannot forget.  Others want to break the chains of memory.  For some, the traumatic impact of violent attacks on them or their loved ones remains a huge burden, one which precludes an easy normality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">That is why the announcement this week of the four Victims Commissioners for Northern Ireland was a welcome development and I wish them well.  If, as individuals or as a society, we are to move on, we need to understand better the dynamics of the particular time through which we have just come, and the manner in which individuals and groups responded or failed to respond, to events during this period.  This process of discovery can take place in a number of ways, particularly through public inquiry.  At Weston Park in July 2001 the two Governments asked Judge Cory to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in a number of cases.  He recommended that inquiries be established in this jurisdiction and in Britain.  This has led to the establishment in this jurisdiction of the tribunal of inquiry into the heinous murders of Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan and to separate inquiries in Northern Ireland into the murders of Billy Wright, Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Judge Cory's recommendation that there be a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane remains outstanding.  I take this opportunity to repeat this House's call for the immediate establishment of a full, independent, judicial inquiry into this terrible murder and I will continue to do that with our British colleagues.  It is time that his family, like so many others, were given greater clarity as to what happened to their loved ones, and who was responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">In other cases, different and less formal processes may also play a useful role and this debate is one of them.  There are issues that will come before the consultative group on the past, led by Archbishop Robin Eames and Denis Bradley.  This group is considering how the legacy of the events of the past decades can best be approached.  I welcome the establishment of this group and offer to co-operate with its work.  I look forward to the work they will be doing as they continue to investigate these matters.  I await with great interest the recommendations which they will present later this year.  The group's public consultations earlier this month highlighted the complex and sensitive issues with which they are engaging.  I have no doubt they will bear this in mind when considering this report.  Building the peace in a way which is respectful of the suffering of the past and which leads to a better future for everyone on these islands is the best way we can honour the dead and serve the living.  Today and yesterday this House has heard many of the reasons we need to face up to our difficult past if we are to arrive at a better future for all and we should not shirk this challenge.</p>

            <p eId="para_1004">The investigation by the Health Information and Quality Authority into the care provided by the HSE to the named individual commenced in June 2007.  In December 2007, information came to the attention of HIQA that led it to decide that further work was needed.  I have been informed by HIQA that it expects this report to be published before the end of February 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">The HSE has advised my Department that a report on the reviews of mammography services and ultrasounds in Portlaoise will be published when the necessary legal requirements have been completed.  The legal process is ongoing.  Due process and natural justice must apply in respect of this report and any report where the findings in that report may affect the professional reputation of any individual.  The report on the review of circumstances which gave rise to the placing of a radiologist on administrative leave in Portlaoise is complete and is with the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The report I requested from the HSE board into the events following the HSE decision to initiate a clinical review of breast cancer services at Portlaoise, being carried out by Mr. John Fitzgerald, is currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The review team carrying out the review of breast services in Barrington's Hospital and medical centre expects to finalise the draft report in the next few weeks.  Following the completion of the necessary legal requirements, the report will be submitted to me and to Barrington's Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The investigation by the Health Information and Quality Authority into pathology services at University College Hospital Galway was commenced in September 2007.  I am informed that significant progress has been made in this investigation.  While it is difficult to predict precisely at this stage when the work will be completed, it is hoped that the investigation will be concluded by the end of March 2008 and the report will be published as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The pathology review in Cork University Hospital is currently being finalised.  It will then be submitted to the director of the national hospitals office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">The greatest health scandal to have hit this country in the last 25 years has been the manner in which women were treated by the breast cancer service in Portlaoise.  The Minister was informed of this in 2005 and her response was appalling; she passed the buck and nothing was done with the consequence that 11 women were misdiagnosed and hundreds of women had to go through the worry and mental anguish of waiting while the results of repeat tests  had to be checked.  I refer to the appalling manner in which files were left stacked up in boxed lots in the corner——</p>

            <p eId="para_1014">I think it is important to set the tone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">They remained until the cohort was reached and until it was decided by the HSE — the Minister's invention which she created by legislation and whose ethos has evolved under her — that it was then the time to deal with these people.  It seemed to be a case of "It is all right, Mrs. Reilly, you might have a breast lump and in fact, you might have cancer, but we will deal with you when we are good and ready.  When we feel we have enough people to warrant taking action, we will take action".  This is the lowest point which the health service has reached for a long time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The Minister promised this House on 7 November 2007 that the Ann O'Doherty report would be available by the end of November, yet we are now at the end of January 2008 and we are being promised the report again.  The reason given for the non-production of this report is that natural justice must be allowed for and we all agree this should be so.  However, the specific reason I was given was that an individual is not in the country having returned to South Africa and must be given sight of the report before a conclusion can be reached.  Is the Minister telling the House and the people of Ireland that if this person does not return to Ireland for two years, we will not have a report for two years?  This is not the case because it is absolute, errant nonsense.  Fax machines and e-mail mean that people can be contacted within 24 hours anywhere in the world.  A person's response can be received and his or her rights can be preserved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Will the Minister ensure that this and the other reports come to hand by the end of next month?  Can she make a commitment that can be kept this time, rather than all the false promises given on this and so many other matters which will be referred to in later questions?</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">I have one other supplementary question.  I ask the Minister to ensure the independence of the Portlaoise second investigation on how the matter was handled and whose terms of reference are broad.  She has asked for the good services of Mr. Fitzgerald but has asked him to report to and work with three members of the board of the HSE.  This does not inspire confidence in the people who were so badly let down by the very same HSE which the Minister is now asking to investigate itself.  On behalf of the people of Ireland and the women who have suffered so badly at the hands of the State's health service, I ask her to assure them that Mr. Fitzgerald can act in an independent fashion, select his own team to help him complete his report and report directly to her so that she can report to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1023">That is a fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">It is the case that nine women were misdiagnosed.  Unfortunately, errors of this kind that happened in the past went unreviewed, unnoticed.  We are not unique in Ireland in recalling patients.  I refer to an article in a French newspaper which states that last week, 7,000 cancer patients were recalled for review and the Deputy is aware of this.  It is not unusual.</p>

            <p eId="para_1029">We have the report.  The HSE had the report by the end of November but it was not in a position to publish the report because of the contents of the report until it went through what I will term the process of natural justice.  I will give the Deputy this assurance that as soon as that process is completed, the report will be published.</p>

However, the board of the HSE does not meet every week.  When I asked the board to carry out a review, it appointed a sub-committee to take charge of the review and this is normal practice.  The sub-committee is neither to write the report nor to vet the report nor to approve a draft of the report but rather simply to deal with some of the logistics associated with his investigation.</p>

         her views on whether the national emergency which she acknowledged due to the number of patients on trolleys in 2006 has re-emerged in winter 2007 in view of statistics and of concerns expressed by the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine; the action that will be taken to address this problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1034">Improving the delivery of accident and emergency services continues to be a top priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">There have been considerable improvements made over the last two years in the delivery of services in accident and emergency departments.  The number of patients awaiting admission to a hospital bed from accident and emergency departments reduced by 50% between December 2005 and December 2007, from an average of 155 to 78 a day.  However, there was an increase in the numbers in recent weeks which the HSE attributes to a number of factors, including increased levels of virulent norovirus, winter vomiting bug; increased levels of influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and an increase in the number of delayed discharges, particularly in the Dublin area.  These are patients who remain in hospital although they have finished the acute phase of their treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">The HSE is working intensively with the hospital system to bring about further sustainable improvements.  One of the key issues being addressed is the system of discharge planning.  A major focus is being placed on ensuring that all patients have an expected date of discharge within 24 hours of admission; the expected date of discharge is actively managed on a daily basis against the treatment plan and any changes are communicated to the patient; patients can be discharged in a more proactive manner at weekends; there is an increased emphasis on nurse-led discharges; and ward rounds are scheduled in a way which facilitates a more timely review of treatment plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">The HSE is also working closely with a number of hospitals reporting significant numbers of patients awaiting admission.  This includes a specific focus on the establishment of clinical decision units and short stay units to accelerate the throughput of patients who present at accident and emergency departments.  Additional measures are also being put in place to deal with the issue of delayed discharges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">In light of the successful conclusion of talks regarding the new contracts for consultants, I hope that progress will be made in advancing the recruitment of additional consultants under the 100 Plus initiative previously announced by the HSE.  The initiative is designed to reward hospitals which are operating in line with established performance targets.  The additional consultants are to be employed in specialties which can alleviate the problems which manifest in accident and emergency departments.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_298">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1039">Does the Minister really believe the reasons given that the numbers have gone up again?  Is she satisfied that the state of accident and emergency services does not amount to a national emergency similar to the one she indicated a relatively short time ago?  The Minister gave very encouraging information about what is being done but can she equate the reality with what she just read out?  Whether one goes by the Irish Nursing Organisation figures or the Health Service Executive figures, the number of people on trolleys is high.  There were up to 400 people on trolleys on one day alone.  The figures from the Irish Nursing Organisation tell us there was an increase of 89% in the number of people on trolleys in December 2007 compared to December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">An ambulance driver who spoke on the radio this week said he has to sit around waiting for trolleys before he can move his ambulance away from the hospital because the trolleys are occupied in the accident and emergency units.  A man in Wexford General Hospital in the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stated on the radio that he waited from Thursday to Saturday to get a bed.  While we heard something reassuring from the Minister, does she believe that is the reality and what will she do to ensure that the accident and emergency crisis is addressed?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1041">I believe what I said and I believe the matter is being addressed.  A number of factors must be taken into account and I have instanced some of them.  If one takes the example of one hospital in Dublin where because of the performance in the hospital in regard to accident and emergency services and other matters, the Health Service Executive employed consultants to go to that hospital.  The recommendations which were produced last September, if implemented, would lead to the freeing up of 64 acute beds.  The Health Service Executive had to write to that hospital only last week to remind it of the measures it was to put in place by the end of March.  I hope that hospital implements these changes because, if not, the Health Service Executive has stated in its letter it will have to make alternative arrangements for those patients with private providers and use the funding that would otherwise go to the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">I got a report about another hospital in this city which has a patient there since 2006 who was fit to be discharged at the end of that year.  There are issues there around long-term care which the new legislation setting up the fair deal scheme will address.  A number of factors in particular influence late discharges.  The affordability and availability of long-term care, particularly around the greater Dublin area, is a factor.  With the new legislative process in regard to those matters we will certainly make enormous progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">There are some places in the country like the north east where the rate of admission into the acute system is twice what it is in other parts of the country.  Deputy O'Sullivan's area of Limerick, for example, rarely has a problem.  I do not say it does not have pressures but in fairness to the hospital in the area it never has the kind of pressures experienced in some big hospitals because that hospital adopts a very good integrated approach with community primary care in the area.  It also has better discharge policies and practices than others.  We can learn from hospitals like that and Waterford Regional Hospital and other good performers such as St. Luke's in Kilkenny.  It is not rocket science, it is already happening in this country and we want it to happen in more places.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_300">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1045">The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop modern, high quality mental health services over a seven to ten-year period.  The Government has accepted the report as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  The Health Service Executive has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of A Vision for Change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its vote.  The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the Health Service Executive that the additional €51.2 million development funding was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the Health Service Executive to live within its approved overall allocation.  As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed.  However, some of these developments will proceed in 2008, for example, the recruitment of eight child and adolescent mental health teams and the provision of 18 beds for children and adolescents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">In regard to the sale of property, I assume the Deputy is referring to The Lie of the Land report recently launched by the Irish Psychiatric Association.  The report gives examples of proceeds of assets allegedly lost to psychiatric services over a 20 to 25-year period.  A small number of assets disposed of in the past two years are identified.  A Vision for Change is very clear on this issue and recommends that resources, both capital and revenue, should be retained in the mental health service.  It also recommends that the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands should be professionally assessed towards identifying appropriate future use and maximum value and benefit.  The value of these assets significantly counterbalances the capital cost of the new mental health services infrastructure requirement.  I have asked the Health Service Executive to provide for me a report on The Lie of the Land report, especially in so far as it relates to the disposal of assets in the past two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has also made it clear to the Health Service Executive in the context of its service plan for 2008 that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in regard to core services.  I will meet the Health Service Executive shortly to pursue these issues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_1049">A Vision for Change recommended the establishment of one child and adolescent mental health team per 50,000 people.  In total there should be 78 teams but only 47 teams have been established and of the 47 teams only 60% of their staffing complement is in place.  That is appalling, given that there were 3,598 children on waiting lists at the end of 2007, with approximately one third waiting more than 12 months for assessment.  These are our children; these are our future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">A Vision for Change also recommended that there should be 100 inpatient beds for children and adolescents and in 2006 the Minister of State's predecessor, the former Deputy, Tim O'Malley, promised 80 beds would become available by 2007.  To date we have only 12 dedicated child and adolescent beds but we are to get an additional 18 beds this year.  Like so many other things we will wait and see whether it will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">We now have a problem because of the Children Act where a young person is considered to be a child until the age of 18 years.  We have no adolescent service in Swords, the fastest growing town in Ireland with a population of 40,000 and expected to reach 100,000.  We have no adolescent service for young people between the ages of 16 years and 18 years.  Adult psychiatrists do not feel competent to deal with them and the junior adolescent service does not have the resources to deal with them.  In effect, they have no service as GPs have stopped referring them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">The question is coming.  Last week the Irish Mental Health Commission revealed that almost half of the €50 million allocated for the implementation of A Vision for Change, to which the Minister of State referred, had been spent in other areas.  On "Prime Time" the Minister was not able to tell us how much of the €50 million had been spent on mental health.  Can the Minister explain why moneys allocated for the implementation of A Vision for Change are not being used for this purpose, why there is no allocation of the €25 million for the implementation of A Vision for Change in the budget of 2008 and why mental health services are being stripped of their assets?</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">I wish to add a supplementary question on the psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital which was promised over 25 years ago.  A unit was built, but it was used because there was overcrowding in the hospital and now there is equipment stored in it.  A further application was made a couple of years ago for a psychiatric unit and now the co-located hospital, although not built entirely on it, impinges on that site and makes it unusable.</p>

On the child and adolescent services, Deputy Reilly correctly stated that there are 12 beds at present.  In the past two weeks I have visited St. Vincent's in Fairview and St. Anne's in Galway and the beds in St. Anne's are ready to be opened while construction is under way in St. Vincent's in Fairview and in St. Stephen's in Cork.  I can guarantee to Deputy Reilly that by the end of this year there will be 30 beds.  In addition, the 20-bed brand new unit in Merlin Park in Galway has just received planning permission and the 20-unit building has gone to tender in Cork.  We expect that those two 20-bed units, allowing for the normal construction delays and planning permissions etc., should be on stream by the middle to the end of 2009.  I guarantee that 30 beds will be operational for child and adolescent psychiatry by the middle to the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1063">The national cancer screening service is planning to roll out the national cervical screening programme on a national basis around the middle of this year.  Women aged 25 to 44 years will be screened every three years while women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every five years.  The service will be available free of charge to eligible women everywhere in the country.  Approximately 230,000 women will be screened annually, assuming an 80% take-up by eligible women.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">All elements of the programme, call-recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  The service is in the process of procuring quality assured internationally accredited laboratory capacity.  The laboratories will be required to meet turnaround times of ten working days.  This process is due to be completed by the end of March.  The programme will be based on a turnaround time of four weeks for smear testing.  The service is also carrying out a baseline quality audit of existing clinical colposcopy services in the State to establish their fitness for purpose in the context of a national cervical screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">Additional revenue funding of €5 million was allocated to the service in 2007 for the roll-out of the programme and an additional €15 million has been allocated in 2008.  Thirty posts have been approved to facilitate integration and roll-out of the programme.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_1066">I will give a quick background.  Fifty years ago in Aberdeen a pilot study was started in this area.  Forty years later we undertook a pilot study, in 1999.  Here we are nearly ten years later and it is still promised.  With the best will in the world, the Minister told us last summer we would have it by the end of the year.  She told us in the autumn that we would have it on 1 January.  Then she told us later, coming up to Christmas, that we would have it some time in January.  Then we were told it would be March.  Now the HSE is stating it will be some time this year.  Is there any real intent to achieve this in 2008?</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">I do not believe the Minister can do it.  She has not put in place the laboratory facilities.  We do not have the necessary facilities such as the accredited laboratory.  She will outsource it to America or some place where we have no control of their quality and we have an issue with building into a system a factor that will make interpretation more difficult and, therefore, mistakes more likely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">This is an illness of which there is 240 new cases each year and where 74 people die each year.  Had the Department put this in place it could have saved hundreds of lives.  We are still here talking about it and promises are still being made.  It is the one cancer of which I am aware that one can detect before it happens because changes occur in the cell which allows one to treat such cells and get rid of them so the cancer never develops.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">I get the impression — I do not like to take this stance — that the Minister seems to be suffering from the disability from which the entire Government, and its leader, the Taoiseach, seems to suffer, namely, she does not seem to be able to give it straight, tell the story as it is, give us a deadline that she can meet and make a commitment that she can keep.  It is all broken promises and excuses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Furthermore, I want to know about the other part of cervical screening, namely, the vaccination.  When will the national immunisation advisory board make its recommendation?  I believe it is in a position to do it.  I cannot understand why it has been held up because the combination of the two could rid us of this terrible scourge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">I want the Minister to give this House a firm commitment.  I ask her to show us that she can do it, that she can give us a deadline that she will keep.  I ask her to give us a date because this carry-on of leading people by the nose causes the public to lose faith and causes a drop in morale among the people who must provide the service.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_313" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1072">First, I never announced it was to be introduced in 2007.  What we announced for 2007 was the provision of €5 million to begin the process of recruiting staff, etc.  As Deputy Reilly well knows, that must happen in advance and sometimes there can be quite a long lead-in time.  Second, we will do this on a full roll-out basis.  It will not be done in the way BreastCheck was done, namely, region by region.  The entire population affected will be done on one national basis and that is why we will be doing so many in one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">Third, I accept what Deputy Reilly stated about other countries.  If memory serves me, Canada introduced this service in 1969.  The cost of these roll-outs in countries like Canada or Scotland is a fraction of what it is here.  Among the issues that affect the cost here is the fee paid to general practitioners for vaccines, which Deputy Reilly well knows is three times higher here than in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">That brings me to the vaccine.  HIQA is undertaking a technology assessment of the vaccine and that will be completed shortly.  The vaccine is obviously preventative for the future and I hope that we will introduce it.  I believe we will, but I must await the technology assessment, which is now part of the law in this country, where we undertake a pharmo-economic assessment of new drugs and technology assessment so that we introduce products or treatments that are effective in an Irish context.  The CEO of HIQA informed me at my meeting with her in the past two weeks that the assessment to which I refer will be ready in the next couple of weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1076">I will not speak of deadlines.  The middle of the year is what I have been told.  I do not announce dates unless I can meet them.  Deputy Reilly attended the launch of this year's Estimates on budget day when we were going through the moneys allocated to health.  He was there and he was welcome.  I stated on that occasion that it would not be January, February or March because until we knew the budget allocation was available the national screening service was not in a position to enter into contracts with anybody, either the providers of laboratory services or general practitioners.  This will be a general practitioner-led service, as Deputy Reilly knows, and that is why it will be so accessible on a countrywide basis.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1078">The improvement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis has been a priority of mine.  The negative experience recounted by some patients is a matter of concern to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of €6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive.  Some 44 additional staff, covering both adult and paediatric services, have been appointed across a number of hospitals, throughout the country and necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the national adult tertiary referral centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.  A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities.  These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus ward and a new accident and emergency department, which includes single room accommodation.  However, I accept that these developments do not address the immediate needs of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">The HSE is currently fast-tracking the redevelopment of a ward which is adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area.  The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms.  On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms.  This will result in a total of 14 single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built, which will include 120 replacement beds in single en suite accommodation, including accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients.  Planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE capital plan and the contract is to be awarded this year.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period is to be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In 2008, a special allocation of €2.5 million capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont Hospital to provide outpatient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">I am keen to support and promote initiatives designed to increase the level of organ donation in this country.  I have supported the annual organ donor awareness campaign, organised by the Irish Donor Network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association.  I also want to ensure that the organ procurement and retrieval rate is maximised at hospitals around the country.  A national audit of potential organ donors commenced last September in 35 acute hospitals with intensive care units.  The audit will seek to identify any obstacles to donation and any measures which may be required to increase the level of donation and retrieval of organs at individual hospitals.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_1085">Would the Minister accept that the manner in which we have treated cystic fibrosis patients and their parents and families is a national disgrace and scandal?  Is she aware there are over 1,100 patients with cystic fibrosis in this country at the moment, the highest proportion of patients per head of population of any other country?  Is she aware that a person born in Ireland with cystic fibrosis has an average life expectancy that is ten years less than a patient in similar circumstances suffering from cystic fibrosis in the United Kingdom or in Northern Ireland and does she regard that as acceptable?</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">Does the Minister acknowledge that, as is the position in adult hospitals, many of the cystic fibrosis units, including those relating to paediatrics and the clinic in Crumlin hospital, do not have ring-fenced, dedicated inpatient wards with single en suite rooms to prevent cross-infection?  Will she acknowledge there is a need to urgently establish such facilities in tandem with providing them for adult patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_318" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1087">I can certainly acknowledge that the facilities we have in place are not what they should be.  However, I equally acknowledge, as have many of the families and the organisation, that the services have greatly improved, particularly with regard to the employment of clinical expertise.  I accept that in this and many other areas the need for single rooms is a priority.  That is the reason the new paediatric hospital for the country will be all single rooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The measures being taken at St. Vincent's Hospital, which will be completed by the end of the summer, are only temporary.  It was the hospital's wish that the cystic fibrosis facilities would be part of the 120-bed facility to be built there.  For many reasons, the hospital did not believe it was appropriate to build a cystic fibrosis unit separate from the 120-bed facility.  That is the reason a modular-type facility will be put in place and ready by the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">We have a long way to go.  The Deputy is correct that we have 1,100 cystic fibrosis patients, 45% of whom are children and 55% are adults.  The life expectancy has greatly improved here, as acknowledged by Professor McElvaney.</p>

            <p eId="para_1091">It is somewhat less, not substantially.  I accept that and I accept the incidence of cystic fibrosis is higher here.  The Deputy is probably aware there are many reasons for that.  The issue is a priority.  In each of the last three years, since I became Minister for Health and Children, we have put specific ring-fenced funding into the area of cystic fibrosis.  In the service plan approval I gave to the HSE before Christmas for 2008, I made special reference to the need to strengthen the facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_1092">Is the Minister aware that since 1983 all newborn babies in Northern Ireland have been screened at birth for cystic fibrosis?  Is she aware this not only allows an early diagnosis, but allows at an early stage for appropriate treatment to be commenced?  Is she aware the average age in Ireland for discovering whether a child has cystic fibrosis is two years?  There is also a gender gap as girls are diagnosed later than boys.  Will the Minister acknowledge there is an urgent need to introduce a neonatal screening programme?</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">In the context of the Minister saying the issue is a priority, can she explain how it is that while her Department was asked to commence such a programme in 2003 and it was promised in 2005, it has not yet been introduced?  How is it that the HSE is now intimating that it may or may not introduce such a programme in 2008?  Will the Minister indicate whether a neonatal screening programme will be commenced in 2008?</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">To return to St. Vincent's Hospital, will the Minister acknowledge that the number of rooms that will be provided by the short-term initiative now being taken are grossly inadequate to meet the need in this area?  Will she explain why the suggestion of a prefabricated unit on an emergency basis with a far greater number of rooms has been turned down?  Will she acknowledge she has now told the House something different about the proposed facility?  It was announced recently that within two years the construction in St. Vincent's would be completed and the single rooms necessary would be available.  Today she has told the House that sometime later this year contracts will be signed.  It will take 24 months for the construction to take place.  Presumably, the new unit will then have to be commissioned.  Will the Minister confirm we are probably four years away from the new extra badly needed facilities being available and will she admit this is unacceptable?</p>

She indicated to me that her counterparts in other countries can receive many of the services at community level for which she must go to hospital.

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_331" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1107">The National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is a 120-bed hospital which provides treatment and rehabilitation for patients with spinal cord injuries, head injuries, amputation, traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury, strokes, neurological disorders, children's disabilities and spina bifida.  It also provides wheelchair and mobility aids assessment, pre-vocational and vocational training programmes involving a wide range of social, personal and work-related skills with a view to enhancing opportunities for each individual for further training, employment and educational options.  There is also a 12-bed hostel to enable clients from outside the greater Dublin area to access day services in the hospital and the vocational training unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">A new hospital is in the planning stages and once built will provide additional capacity at the hospital.  This project would increase the bed capacity of the National Rehabilitation Hospital to 235 beds.  I understand that a project team is working with an appointed design team to develop the brief for the new hospital and plan for the development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The Health Service Executive has also informed the Department that a project team has just completed a needs assessment on the development of an acute medical rehabilitation unit of 25 beds which is recommended to be built at Beaumont Hospital.  This unit would provide acute medical rehabilitation services and early rehabilitation for those suffering from brain injury who access the national neurosciences unit at Beaumont and who currently have to access services at the National Rehabilitation Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Plans had been prepared in some areas for regional rehabilitation facilities. The Department and the Health Service Executive are aware of the need to review the potential benefits of a regional network of rehabilitation facilities and services.  The development of such a network should be considered in the context of a national strategy for rehabilitation services and the Department is currently considering this issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1111">Does the Minister agree that it is hugely distressing for families to know that immediate rehabilitation care is crucial for those who suffer brain injury, stroke or any other condition that results in people attending the National Rehabilitation Hospital?  Getting in quickly for treatment is crucial.  I welcome the fact that a new unit is planned, which will increase the number of beds from 120 to 235.  What is the timeframe for providing those extra beds?  Are there any plans for Cork?  There has been some confusion as to whether a unit is planned for Cork so perhaps the Minister will clarify the situation.  Will he also clarify if an acute stroke unit or one of the acute regional units he mentioned is planned for Cork?  There is serious concern in the south of the country that the beds currently available are all located in Dublin.  It appears the new beds will also be in the Dublin area.  What are the plans for the south of the country?  Will the Minister also elaborate on the plans for regional units?  I stress again how crucial it is for the projected recovery of these patients to get into hospital and receive treatment at an early stage.  When will extra beds and facilities be provided?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1112">The Department is currently considering the development of a formal policy on rehabilitation.  A number of issues must be considered, including a needs assessment on a population health basis, the structure of the service provision, the location of the facilities and the nature of the facilities, that is, whether they are hospital, step-down or preparation for independent living.  In other words, they would range from acute care to the stage just before going home.  The need for the rehabilitation strategy has been brought to the fore for a number of reasons, including population growth and increased trauma survival, especially in cases of stroke and road traffic accidents.  The national policy will inform the framework of rehabilitation services which the HSE, as the agency responsible for providing and contracting services, will have to develop.</p>

What is happening to the thousands of people in this country who suffer stroke or acquire a brain injury and end up in nursing homes?  Does the Minister not agree that what is provided in Dún Laoghaire at present is inadequate from the point of view of capacity?  Will the Minister state how Ireland compares to the rest of Europe, the United States and other countries in this area?  It is true that Ireland is not at the races and that it is a disgrace compared to Europe?</p>

            <p eId="para_1122">Does the Minister accept that part of the capacity problem arises as a result of HSE cutbacks?  Many patients in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire cannot be discharged because no home care packages are in place.  Those patients, therefore, are occupying urgently needed beds.  When will the cutbacks stop?  When will these crucial hospital beds be released by putting in place care in the community?</p>

            <p eId="para_1123">I agree it is important that acute beds are released for acute cases.  As Deputy Reilly mentioned, before Christmas provision was made to allow patients to be discharged from the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  I agree that stroke units have a better outcome in the immediate situation.  Obviously, rehabilitation is a different and complex area and, as such, the development of rehabilitative beds, be they acute, semi-acute or step-down, is a vital component of our infrastructure.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">As I mentioned in an earlier reply, considerable improvements have been made in the delivery of services in emergency departments.  Specific targeted actions are in train to deal with internal management in hospitals in order to improve patients' experiences.  The HSE is also arranging for 200 additional beds to be contracted in private nursing homes with a particular focus on major Dublin hospitals.  The HSE advises that 56 of these places have been filled since 18 January.  In addition, the HSE advises that it will open an additional 100 long-stay beds from March onwards in a new community nursing unit at St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  These will be used mainly for older people who have completed their acute phase of treatment.  These developments follow on from the opening last December of 94 additional long stay beds at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">The HSE is proceeding with the implementation of an additional 360 home care packages in 2008 at a cost of €10 million.  It is intended to prioritise these additional home care packages to support the Dublin area in particular, a number of the other large urban areas and some specific acute hospitals, such as Cork city, Waterford, Wexford, Limerick, Galway, Mayo.  A total of 120 of these are scheduled for implementation in the first quarter.  The combination of these measures and those outlined in my earlier reply will lead to continued improvement in emergency departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1129">Will the Minister acknowledge that we have a capacity problem and that demand is outstripping supply?  We can reduce demand by putting in place things such as prevention, national body tests, diagnostics in the community and one-stop-shops in the community where people can be seen and treated by their general practitioner without having to go to hospital.  We can increase capacity by getting better use of beds that are currently inappropriately occupied and by building more beds in the short term.  That will have to be done.  There is no point having long-term plans for 2020 with 4,000 fewer beds in the system.  Whether it is cystic fibrosis, psychiatry, mental health, care of the elderly, accident and emergency figures, neurology, urology or neurosurgery, the dreadful situation is an indictment of our health service.

Will the Minister use modular hospitals, as they do throughout Europe, to build 1,500 community beds, rather than 200 or 300 such beds, over the next six months?  I thank the Minister for alluding to such hospitals earlier in response to a question I asked.  The Minister for Education and Science plans to use schools in such a manner.  We need to get those who do not need to be in our hospitals out of our hospitals.  Will the Minister at least free up the beds that are currently there?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_351" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
            <p eId="para_1132">Although we may be political opponents, I have a great deal of respect for Deputy Reilly, as he knows.  As someone who has a lot of knowledge of this area, he knows it is not all gloom and doom and bad news in this respect.  Things have vastly improved.  In 1980, life expectancy in this country was two years below the EU15 average — it is now 18 months above that average.  Sweden is the only country in Europe where men live longer than they do in Ireland.  Just one third of the number of people who used to die from circulatory illnesses 30 years ago now die from such illnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">While we face challenges and pressures, we should put things in context.  I invite Deputy Reilly, as a member of as the Joint Committee on Health and Children, to visit Stockholm, which has twice the population of Dublin but just half the number of acute beds.  They do things differently there — they have better discharge policies and they do not keep people in hospital unnecessarily.  If one is in a hospital in Dublin on Friday, there is a 99% chance that one will still be there on Monday morning.  I hope the new contract will deal with some work practice issues, such as the availability of consultants.  I accept that we need more consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">I know of a hospital in Dublin that could free up 64 beds if it were to organise its acute beds system differently.  Consultants went in there.  Experts who have brought about change in other countries made recommendations about the hospital in September.  I have seen a letter sent to the hospital by the HSE asking why certain recommendations have not been followed, given that there are people on trolleys.  When I looked yesterday at data from another Dublin hospital, I learned that a patient who was fit to be discharged in 2006 is still in the hospital because the person is unwilling to go to a nursing home or a long-term care facility, or to go home on a home care package.  Some existing issues in that regard will be dealt with under the fair deal.  It is not appropriate for somebody to choose to stay in an acute hospital when alternatives have been put in place.  As Deputy Reilly is aware, it is dangerous for a patient to remain in such a hospital if he or she does not need to be there.  People should be in such hospitals only if they have to be.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">Just under 5% of people in Ireland over the age of 65 are in long-term care, which is in line with the international average.  The problem is that one third of those people would not need to be in long-term care if we had better home support systems.  Not only are more facilities being put in place, but new home support packages are also being provided.  They take a while to put in place because it is expensive to recruit the appropriate staff etc.  We have been building them up each year over recent years and they are making an impact.  It is a question of doing a number of different things.</p>

            <p eId="para_1137">While we might have a problem, a Leas Cheann-Comhairle, at least we are not facing a crisis, unlike the health service.  How can the Minister credibly claim to be dealing with the accident and emergency crisis when she is continuing to cut back hospital services?  Is she aware of a document that came into the public domain this week which advocates the closure of the accident and emergency department at Monaghan General Hospital?  That would have a significant knock-on impact on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which is already grossly overcrowded.  How can the Minister claim to be dealing with the accident and emergency crisis when more and more services are being closed?  When will she stop this approach?  When will she take charge of this problem and sort it out?  She is allowing HSE officials to tinker about with the health of people in this State as if they were dealing with cattle.</p>

            <p eId="para_1138">I would like to ask the Minister about home care packages.  Many Deputies attended a presentation made by the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament yesterday.  When one meets senior citizens, one is told that their preferred option is to stay at home, with support.  The Minister said that home care packages are expensive.  They are primarily privately procured.  We are privatising the care of elderly people in their own homes.  Why can we not build up the home help service so it is like it used to be?  The Minister talks about home help as if it were some kind of newfangled way of looking after people.  Is she abandoning the development of the public home care system, involving public health nurses and home helps etc.?  While I welcome the provision of an additional 360 home care packages this year, they do not represent much more than a drop in the ocean in terms of the number of elderly people in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">Rather than providing for such cutbacks in the HSE, would it not be more cost-effective to develop the public provision of care for people at home?  It would mean that elderly people would not have to stay in acute hospitals and we would not have to pay the private sector its top-up profit, not to mention the cost of recruiting professionals and paying their salaries?</p>

            <p eId="para_1140">We are developing the home care sector.  It is not something that has always been done, however.  It used to be all or nothing — one went into a public long-term care facility, where 90% of the cost of one's care was subsidised, or one went into a private nursing home, perhaps with the help of a subvention, and had to pay at least 60% of the cost of one's care.  It was totally inequitable.  There was virtually nothing else at home.  The home help service has been developed rapidly since it was initiated some years ago.  I am in favour of whatever works for older people, regardless of who provides the care.  I meet many families and hear their stories.  I saw a letter yesterday or the day before in which a family in Dublin was full of praise for a private company that is supplying the care.  There has to be some flexibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1157">A review of ambulance service provision in Dublin city and county, which was commissioned and jointly chaired by Dublin City Council and the Health Service Executive, was completed in February 2007.  The review was not formally progressed during 2007 because we were awaiting the receipt of the judgment of the European Court of Justice in a case against Ireland relating to the arrangements for the supply of emergency ambulance services in the Dublin area by Dublin Fire Brigade.  The judgment in that case was published on 18 December last.  The HSE and Dublin City Council are in a position to formally consider the recommendations arising from the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">The HSE gives Dublin Fire Brigade funding to provide an emergency ambulance service for Dublin city and county.  The HSE has provided over €9 million for this purpose in 2008.  Dublin Fire Brigade operates 12 ambulances for emergency services only, from a number of bases in the city and county.  The service operates on a 24-hour, 365-day basis.  The HSE operates its own fleet from four Dublin city bases — St. James's Hospital, Loughlinstown, Tallaght and Swords.  The service may be supplemented by ambulances from the wider Dublin and mid-Leinster area as required.</p>

            <p eId="para_1161">I tabled this question because I am concerned that on 18 January 2007, Dublin Fire Brigade had four ambulances tied up at the Mater Hospital for between two and three hours and three further ambulances tied up at Beaumont Hospital.  The seven ambulances in question, which represent over 60% of Dublin Fire Brigade's ambulance service, could not be used because the service could not get its trolleys back.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">When I asked the Minister a question about the matter, it was referred to the HSE, which issued a facetious response to me.  I asked why Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital do not provide portakabins where spare trolleys can be kept, thereby allowing ambulance personnel to deliver patients into the care of accident and emergency departments, to collect a spare trolley from the portakabin and to get back on the road to save someone else's life on the M50 or wherever.  The facetious response I was given was that patients cannot be moved off trolleys, which has nothing to do with what I asked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">The reality, as the Minister said, is that Dublin Fire Brigade has had just 12 ambulances for the last 20 years, even though the population of the greater Dublin area has exploded by 600,000 or 700,000 in that time.  Ambulances have to stay outside accident and emergency departments in a manner that seems designed to keep patients out of hospital, although for all the wrong reasons.  I would like the Minister to ensure I get a proper response to my question.  I ask her to give the House a commitment that she will instruct the HSE to ensure that spare trolleys are kept in portakabins in the manner I propose.  Given that ambulances are such scarce resources, and more of them are needed, I ask that those we have at least be used appropriately.</p>

They wish to discuss with the Government their real concerns about the legislation and, in particular, their concerns about its effect on the family home.  They are also concerned about the possibility of pressure being put on elderly people to sign over resources to other family members.  This is a real worry to people at that stage of their lives, when security, their possessions and their family homes are important to them.  There is concern about the effect of this legislation from this point of view.  What is the nature of the consultation the Minister has had with these organisations?  Was there an opportunity for them to engage directly, express their concerns and discuss how they might be addressed in the wording of the Bill?</p>

            <p eId="para_1174">I understand what the Deputy is saying.  Only two weeks ago I met with members of the Senior Citizens Parliament and a number of other bodies, allowing an earlier opportunity for consultation.  As we speak the Bill has not yet come before us as it is still with the Office of the Attorney General.  We are not in a position to discuss the Bill until it is published, which we expect to take place within the next couple of weeks.  On its publication we will be able to engage further with the stakeholders and the social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">Having met with the Senior Citizens Parliament representatives, I am surprised to hear they felt they did not have sufficient consultation.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Harney, has been in discussion with that group and with others.  An afternoon at Farmleigh was dedicated to the consultation process with a number of groups.  This opportunity will be there again once the Bill is published.</p>

            <p eId="para_1176">I confirm what Deputy O'Sullivan has said.  Representatives of Age Action Ireland have said they feel they were not properly consulted.  Perhaps the legal difficulties being experienced by the Attorney General with regard to this Bill are a consequence of this lack of consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">The Minister has given many good examples of how the new scheme, A Fair Deal, is expected to work.  In principle, I do not have an issue with this.  However, she omitted the difficult examples.  With regard to running down the other assets before the family home is affected, what about the shopkeeper who owns a shop and lives with Mammy?  What about the publican or the small farmer?  This must be clarified.  However, the most important issue is the standard of care and protection of patients.  A plan must be devised, implemented, monitored and enforced.  When I met with representatives of HIQA, they did not indicate they were in a position to do this within a reasonable time.  They have not even devised the standards yet, let alone obtained the resources for monitoring, enforcement and inspection of homes.  Unless there is someone to enforce standards, there is no point in having them.  We must have standards to protect our elderly people.  Will HIQA be given the funding to do this within the next six months?  My understanding is that it will not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">I hope the Minister will publish the heads of the Bill early to allow ample time for discussion, with no guillotines.  This is a major issue for our society for the reasons already outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_1180">The Deputy gave an example of a shopkeeper.  The immediate contribution by the applicant towards the cost of his or her care will be based on 80% of his or her assessable income.  In the case of a shopkeeper, this refers to his or her earnings, or for an older person, his or her pension.  Depending on the amount of assessable income there will also be a deferred contribution of up to 5% of the applicant's assets, such as his or her home.</p>

We did not know what resources it would have until the budget.  A total of €15 million was allocated to the board on top of the €5 million allocated last year.  On this basis it is now proceeding, as Deputy Reilly will have heard from his colleagues, with discussions on a proposed 12-month contract.

            <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1217">I raise this matter because of the appalling treatment received by a little five-year-old boy in my constituency, who is in urgent need of speech and language therapy.  Speech and language therapy is like life blood to persons who are speech or language impaired since verbal communication is the essence of modern life.  This therapy is as essential to a speech or language-impaired person as a wheelchair is to someone who is mobility-impaired.  Effective verbal communication will enable a person to make a positive contribution to society and live a normal life.  This child was placed on a waiting list for assessment, which transpired to be over a period of 12 months.  After waiting for 12 months, the child was assessed and was rated as being in "critical" need of services.  From this assessment, one would imagine that the child would be placed at or near the top of a priority list for treatment.  The parents have been informed that the child faces a minimum further 12 months on a waiting list before he can have access to speech and language therapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">What a sad and shameful commentary on the level of speech and language therapy services available in this country eight years into the 21st century.  This matter got some national coverage and, since I raised it, a number of parents around the country have been in touch with me.  Nothing has changed since I first raised this issue in the Dáil a quarter of a century ago in a similar case when I described speech and language therapy services then as "dire" and "in the Dark Ages".</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">Back then, just 25 speech and language therapists were graduating annually from the College of Speech and Language Therapy — barely enough to cover retirements.  The number of speech and language therapists in the country then was around 85, less than a quarter of the minimum optimum figure recommended by the Quirk report 10 years earlier in 1975, 33 years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">Let us fast-forward to 2002, when the Bacon report recommended that the annual output of 25 be increased fourfold to 100 in an attempt to make some impact on the waiting lists.  To his credit, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, committed to increasing the annual number of graduates to 100, as Bacon had recommended.  One would think this was signalling a new era for all those persons who had spent years in some cases on waiting lists for this vital service.  Unfortunately, when the first graduates came on stream and were available for appointment, they were turned down due to lack of experience.  How were they expected to gain the necessary experience except by being initially appointed to posts which had not been created?  The problem was that we trained people but did not create the posts.  The policy was so pig-headed and illogical that one wonders how people can seriously cook up such facile impediments to the provision of an essential service to persons in grave need of treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">The earliest possible intervention for children with speech and language disorders is crucial, since it can preclude the need for infinitely more costly intervention at a later stage, perhaps when the persons are in their teens or older.</p>

            <p eId="para_1223">I have had practical experience of children who failed to receive this essential service.  Between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, it is a scandal that we have gone through the so-called Celtic tiger while young, unfortunate children are left impaired because of the lack of commitment by the State to co-ordinate a service essential to young people whether in schools or outside.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">I will continue to raise this matter for as long as God gives me the health to remain in this House.  I first raised the issue 25 years ago about a particular individual whose parents were told that their child was mentally handicapped and that they should put him in an institution and have another baby.  Today that young man is a qualified architect.  When I think back I wonder how many unfortunate young people were cast into mental institutions, as they were then known, and are still there today who only needed psychological and speech therapy to lead normal lives.  I shudder to think how many people were left in that situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">I have given a practical example from 25 years ago and if the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, wishes to accompany me, I will be only too happy to introduce him to the parents of that man who is now a fully qualified architect, contributing to this society and to the health services through his taxes.  Something must be done immediately.  The Minister of State should examine what is currently being done in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  We should be ashamed of ourselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_1228">I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the important issues raised by the Deputy.   I wish to emphasise the Government's commitment to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment we have been making in disability services over the last number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The National Disability Strategy, which was launched in September 2004, reinforces equal participation in society of people with disabilities and provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities.  This programme, together with the enhancement of other key support services, are key factors in building the additional capacity required to ensure that services best meet identified needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">The strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in equality legislation.  It puts the policy of mainstreaming of public services for people with disabilities on a clear legal footing.  The  main elements of the strategy are the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, sectoral plans published in 2006 by six Departments, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the multi-annual investment programme for disability support services for the period 2006-2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">In launching the national disability strategy, the Taoiseach also announced the Government's commitment to a multi-annual investment for disability-specific services over a five year period.  To the end of 2007, €420 million, in revenue and capital, has been allocated to services for people with disabilities since the launch of the strategy in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Additional revenue funding of €50 million was provided in the 2008 budget in respect of the multi-annual investment package.  This funding is to meet the costs associated with a range of elements in the multi-annual investment programme.  The additional funding will continue to provide a base line to considerably enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for people with disabilities, in line with the Government's commitment to build capacity within the health services and to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the national disability strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1234">The Health Service Executive, which has statutory responsibility for the provision of services to individuals, states that it recognises that waiting lists exist for many services.  It is a reality that these lists are managed in different ways by different services.  Therapies divide their waiting lists into priority categories so that immediate need is first dealt with, followed by urgent need, and finally all other needs.  Some therapies further divide their waiting lists into assessment and treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">The management of waiting lists is an issue for the HSE to address.  Nevertheless, my Department is concerned about the lack of consistency in how waiting lists are managed as, in addition, each voluntary agency holds their own waiting list so it is very difficult to get a clear picture of waiting lists for services.  However, I understand that in relation to therapy services, clinicians manage and review these lists regularly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">In the period 2005 to 2007, the Department provided funding to the HSE for the employment of multi-disciplinary supports and other staff in the context of the implementation of the Disability and Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Acts.  A total of 446 posts were approved in the areas of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, psychology, physiotherapy and social work between the HSE and voluntary service providers.  The HSE states that the majority of these posts were identified as required to provide the assessments and ongoing service interventions arising from the commencement of the Disability Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">It continues to be a challenge to fill these important posts, which inevitably contributes to the development of waiting lists.  The HSE has advised the Department that it is currently finalising plans for a co-ordinated recruitment process in each region, in addition to recruitment abroad for senior therapists over the next number of months, to fill the remaining posts.  The filling of these key posts will help to address the waiting lists of the kind raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">I understand the HSE has explained the situation in relation to the individual case raised by the Deputy and that it will continue to do all it can to provide services to those assessed as in need of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1239">The courage shown by a number of young adults with cystic fibrosis, people like Orla Tinsley and Jennifer Tormey who told their stories on the national airwaves, must be rewarded with firm commitment and action by the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  That is why I am raising this matter in the Dáil today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">Their harrowing stories expose a system that is not responding to their most basic need, namely, to be able to get to hospital and receive treatment without being exposed to the kind of infections that could so easily shorten, or even end, their lives.  It is vital for cystic fibrosis patients to be able to access treatment in a dedicated unit with individual rooms, each with en suite bathrooms.  This does not seem too much to ask in a country as rich as ours.  I must point out that we did not only find out about this issue on the airwaves over the past few weeks.  In fact, Doctor Ron Pollock, who conducted a survey and independent review relating to cystic fibrosis, published his report on Monday, 7 February 2005.  At that time, he said that the majority of adults with cystic fibrosis are being treated in facilities that are dangerous.  That was in February 2005.  Tomorrow is the first day of February 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">It is entirely wrong that sick people have to resort to appealing for help on a radio programme to get the health care to which they are entitled.  However, by taking that action, despite its toll on their health, they have succeeded in getting certain commitments which I wish to ensure are clearly stated on the record of this Parliament.  My understanding is that a temporary unit will be provided at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, catering for 14 patients at a time.  I understand from the Minister that it will cater for six initially, and then a further eight patients, totalling 14, by the end of the summer of 2008.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to confirm that this is the intention and that agreement has been reached with the hospital and the HSE to make this happen.  Further, I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the rooms will have en suite facilities that will ensure there is no cross-infection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">I also understand there is a commitment to providing a 34 bed dedicated cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, as part of a larger development.  Again, I ask the Minister of State to confirm this on the record and to indicate the anticipated time frame.  The Minister said earlier it would be late 2010 when this would be finished.  I would like that to be placed on the record and the process speeded up, if at all possible.  Late 2010 is quite a long time to wait for this facility to be up and running fully.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">These are the most pressing issues on which clear commitments are needed.  However, a comprehensive service must address the requirements of patients all over the country.  Dr. Gerard Canny, of the cystic fibrosis unit in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, wrote a letter which was published in today's newspapers, in which he stresses the need for a continuum of care from babyhood to adulthood, with multi-disciplinary teams, as well as dedicated inpatient wards with single, en suite rooms to prevent cross-infection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">He argues for the introduction of a screening programme for newborns to ensure early diagnosis.  Such a programme has been in place in Northern Ireland since 1983.  It produces much better outcomes because early detection means early treatment and provision of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">I commend the bravery of Orla Tinsley, Jennifer Tormey and the many young people and families — in some cases, members of those families have died of cystic fibrosis at an early age — who took the initiative, went on the airwaves and continue to campaign for facilities.  That they have done something they should not have needed to do is a shame on us.  They deserve clarity and urgency concerning what will occur.  In particular, they do not deserve to subject themselves to the danger of infection by attending accident and emergency departments and wards comprising people with a variety of illnesses, including hospital-transmitted illnesses such as MRSA and C. difficile.  We must respond to these young people and I want to ensure a commitment to them on the record of the House.  We who have been elected by the people must ensure that their needs are met as quickly and comprehensively as possible.  I look forward to the Minister of State putting those commitments on the record.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1246">I will be taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The Minister acknowledges the need to improve services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  The negative experience recounted recently by a number of young patients is a matter of much concern.  I join Deputy O'Sullivan and others in acknowledging their courage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">The Minister identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in the Estimates process.  In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of €6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive to develop services.  The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the national tertiary referral centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.  Some 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date throughout the country, ten of these posts at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally, including a further nine posts at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">The Minister accepts the need to improve the infrastructural facilities for persons with cystic fibrosis attending St. Vincent's Hospital.  A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities.  These include a new ambulatory care centre with dedicated accommodation — eight suites in total — incorporating single room facilities on an outpatient appointment basis for cystic fibrosis patients in an environment that allows for improved infection control, the refurbishment of St. Camillus's ward, which provides 15 additional respiratory-cystic fibrosis beds, bringing the bed complement to 44, and a new accident and emergency department, including single room accommodation that may be used for the care of cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">It is accepted that these developments do not address the immediate needs of patients.  The HSE has been working intensively with the hospital and representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improvements.  The Department is advised that the option of developing a modular unit is being examined in this context and the position will be clarified shortly.  The HSE advises that it is fast-tracking the redevelopment of a ward adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area.  The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms.  On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms, which will result in a total of 14 single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single en suite accommodation.  The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and include appropriate isolation facilities.  Planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE capital plan and the contract is to be awarded by the end of this year.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design-build period is to be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.  The developments I have outlined will significantly enhance the level of service provided for persons with cystic fibrosis.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_424">
            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1251">I am glad to inform the House that I am not attempting to extend my remit into other constituencies.  This issue was dealt with in the first instance by my colleague and party leader, Deputy Kenny.  He adroitly and correctly referred to the appeals system, a hearing was held and the original decision upheld.  However, it has come to my attention that the refusal to award a respite care grant was in respect of two people, not one.  When I challenged the refusal, I was informed that it was the decision of the deciding officer that neither person qualified.  I pursued the matter further to discover that one of the people was elderly, the mother of the carer.  Given the decision, I assumed that she was in her 70s and did not require ongoing care and attention.  However, I discovered that she was aged 82 years.  It was concluded that she was ambulant and did not require care and attention as envisaged under the scope of the grant.  I reject that opinion in its entirety.  There is no 82 year old who does not require ongoing care and attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">To make matters more complicated, I discovered when pursuing the case further that the person concerned was also caring for a brother.  I assumed that the brother was in receipt of a disability allowance, was not severely affected and could get by on his own, but I was appalled to discover that he was a cancer patient who required ongoing care and attention.  It transpires that he qualified on medical grounds, but the Department overlooked this fact for some unknown reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Where two people were receiving care and attention of the nature provided by the carer, thereby ensuring that the State need not incur an expenditure by way of providing institutional care at a time when hospitals and other institutions across the country are overcrowded, would it not be in everyone's interests, including the Exchequer's, to make a decision in favour of the claimant?  For the life of me, I cannot understand how a decision could be made on medical or economic grounds to refuse a grant to someone claiming it on behalf of two persons.  As the grant is envisaged, the legislation provides that a person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where they require continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day.  That criterion applies in both cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">The Minister of State opposite me will probably read a history lesson.  With all due respect to Members — I listened to the plight of Deputy Barrett's case — we are wasting our time if we go down this road.  An appalling decision was made in respect of someone caring for two people, a cancer patient and a person aged 82 years.  I rest my case and I hope that the Minister of State will use his care and compassion as a medical practitioner to ensure the decision in question is overturned.  I hope he will contact the office of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and tell it that there are no economic or other grounds for a decision of this nature to be repeated.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_425" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1255">The main conditions for receipt of the respite care grant are that the person or persons in respect of whom the application is made must require full-time care and attention and that the applicant must be providing that care.  The legislation provides that a person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where they require continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or to avoid danger to themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">The person to whom the Deputy refers submitted an application for a respite care grant in respect of his mother and his brother.  In respect of the applicant's brother, the deciding officer refused the application on the grounds that the care given is in the nature of help around the house and farm which does not constitute the care and attention envisaged by the legislation.  In respect of the applicant's mother, the application was refused on the grounds that her condition is not such that she requires the level of care envisaged by the legislation.  The deciding officer based this decision on the advice of a medical assessor who reviewed the medical evidence submitted by her general practitioner.  Also, in respect of the applicant's mother, the deciding officer was not satisfied that the level of care being provided was consistent with that envisaged in the respite care grant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The decisions were appealed to the social welfare appeals office.  The appeals officer examined all the evidence submitted, including that adduced at an oral hearing, and upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  A decision by an appeals officer is final but can be revised if new evidence or facts or any relevant change of circumstances come to light after a decision is made.  It is open to the person concerned to make an application for the 2008 respite care grant if he feels that he may qualify.  The earliest date for receipt of any such application is 10 April 2008.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1259">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment and the Minister of State for coming to the House to debate the need to construct a new building for the gaelscoil in Midleton in County Cork.  As the Minister of State may be aware, Midleton is one of the fastest growing areas in the country.  In 1999, 159 students were enrolled in primary schools in Midleton, including Saleen outside the town.  Last year, the numbers rose by 226.  The total number of primary school students in the town is 1,661 and it is envisaged that this number will increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The gaelscoil is operating in premises that are unsuited to its needs.  It has an enrolment of 268 children.  We are told that this will increase to 310 next September and 346 in September 2009.  It operates out of an inadequate building with insufficient space, leaking roofs and insufficient toilet facilities which staff share with children.  There is no storage space and the school building opens on to the open road.  There is a huge demand for places due to the excellent staff and a desire by parents to have their children taught through Irish.  This year, the school will have to turn away children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">A site is available and planning permission has been granted.  Midleton is a growing town and I understand that it has been described by the Department as being in crisis where primary school places are concerned.  A construction company agreed to build a school and make a site available.  Everyone was happy with that and it was all systems go.  However, that company has recently written to say that it is not in a position to give a date for the completion of the school owing to the slowdown in the housing market.  On a positive note, however, it can and will make available immediately and free of charge to the Department of Education and Science a site with full planning permission for a school to the value of €6 million.  I know that until recently, the Department and the Office of Public Works were actively seeking a site for the school.  There is a great need for it and I urge the Minister of State to go back to the Department of Education and Science and impress on it the urgency of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">It appears that there will be another increase in numbers in the school next September.  Portakabins are being used and the situation is unsafe, yet it is a very successful school.  It needs a new building.  The site, plans and everything else are in place.  Unfortunately, the school wanted to and thought it could build a new school independently of the Department with no cost to the State.  That will not happen because of the downturn in the construction industry so we go back to the Department to see whether it will fund the building of the school on the site as planned as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">I would like the Minister of State to say it will happen and will proceed.  I will not hold my breath but I ask him and the Minister for Education and Science to use their good offices in the Department to ensure this happens.  There is great need.  All the schools in the area are full.  Building this school would serve to alleviate the problem of overcrowding in the schools in Midleton in the short term.  It is a growing town and will grow even more.  The projections are frightening.  I await the Minister of State's reply and hope it will be positive.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1264">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding Gaelscoil Mainistir na Corann.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nevertheless, since taking office, this Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As evidence of our commitment, national development plan funding of €4.5 billion will be invested in schools over the coming years.  I am sure the Deputy will agree this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">Gaelscoil Mainistir na Corann is a co-educational primary gaelscoil with a current enrolment of 268 pupils.  The Department of Education and Science received an application for capital funding towards the provision of new school buildings.  As the Deputy will be aware, the school authority and a private construction firm, without the direct involvement of the Department, were involved in an initiative to build a 16-classroom school on land owned by the developer at no cost to the school or the Department.  The Department has not been involved in the design of the school nor has capital funding been provided in respect of the proposed project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">I understand that the initiative to build a 16-classroom school on land owned by the developer has been changed to an offer of a site.  To progress the gaelscoil's application using the traditional method, an assessment of projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and housing developments in the area will be required to determine the long-term projected staffing figure on which the school's accommodation needs will be based.  Once the long-term projection has been determined and agreed with the school authorities, the required building project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter and allowing me to outline the position regarding Gaelscoil Mainistir na Corann.</p>

         if funds of €51m were allocated in 2006 and 2007 for the development of the mental health services in line with A Vision for Change have been diverted to other service areas; and if so, the areas in which this diversion took place and the allocation of extra funding for the continued implementation of the development of the mental health services recommendations contained in the report.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1289">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 45 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change", which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop modern, high quality mental health services over a seven to ten year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The estimated additional cost of the implementation of "A Vision for Change" is €150m over 7-10 years.  A total of  €51.2 million has been allocated since 2006 which represents over a third of the overall requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">There are substantial resources already invested in mental health. In 2007, it is estimated that €1 billion was spent on these services.  In addition to the extra funding required, existing resources need to be remodelled and reallocated.  Indeed, implementation of "A Vision for Change" is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources than on new funding.   Both aspects of the additional investment and  the reorganisation of  existing mental health services and resources must be managed in parallel. In view of the significant additional investment in 2006 and 2007, it is appropriate, in 2008, to pause and review the situation to ensure consolidation of the investment to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the HSE that the additional  €51.2m development funding was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its approved overall allocation. As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed. However, some of these developments will proceed in 2008 for example, the recruitment of 8 child and adolescent mental health teams and the provision of 18 beds for children and adolescents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney has made it clear to the HSE in the context of their Service Plan for 2008 that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures in relation to other services.  The Minister also pointed out that she believed there is scope within the HSE's overall allocation to deliver further service enhancements in 2008 over and above those outlined in the Service Plan through improved performance / productivity and realignment of existing resources.   I will be meeting with the HSE shortly to pursue these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">Prof. Tom Keane took up his post as National Cancer Control Director in November 2007.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant realignment of services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  The decisions of the HSE to designate four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  A detailed transitional plan will be put in place to facilitate the progressive, gradual and carefully managed transfer of services over the next two years or so.</p>

            <p eId="para_1304">Following engagement between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) under Mr Bill Shipsey SC in December 2007, at which the sides did not reach agreement, the HSE has offered a draft interim contract to pharmacists to address their main concerns regarding the alleged impact of the proposed revised wholesaler arrangements on GMS-dependent pharmacies. I am informed that the HSE intends to implement the revised wholesaler arrangements from 1st March 2008. The Executive also recently commenced discussions with the IPU and other parties on the development of a new substantive pharmacy contract. The details of the draft interim contract, and the HSE's other intentions in this regard, were set out in a letter to individual community pharmacists on 2nd January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">In the light of the legal position previously outlined in the House and after further consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Departments and the HSE on the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists in compliance with competition law, my Department is working to develop appropriate arrangements for the development of contracts and for the setting of the fees payable in respect of contracts with private sector undertakings for the provision of health services on behalf of the HSE.  These arrangements may include the establishment of an independent body which would consider the nature of the service to be provided and all other relevant factors in each case and make recommendations to the Government in relation to the fees it considers appropriate. The composition of such a body, its terms of reference and the timescale for its work are amongst the matters to be considered in this regard. In line with the legal advice received, the HSE may enter into discussions with community pharmacists on the non-fee aspects of their contract, with a view to developing a new substantive pharmacy contract.</p>

         the number of staff in the Health Service Executive on long term leave due to illness; if there is a strategic management plan for the delivery of health services in County Wicklow; and if the impact of the random job cuts in the health service has been evaluated on the ability of the health care service terms to deliver the services required.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1307">Data regarding the percentage of staff on long-term sick leave is collated as part of the HSE's Corporate Performance Measurement Report.  This report captures information on staff that are on reduced pay due to sick leave.  The last report (for quarter 3, 2007) indicated that 2.1% of staff employed directly by the HSE were on long-term sick leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">The 2008 National Service Plan (NSP) has been approved by me and laid before the Oireachtas.  It outlines the type and volume of health and personal services to be provided by the Executive on a national basis.  The NSP is supported by a business planning process which translates these national deliverables into local deliverables at area, hospital network, local and unit level.  I have been informed by the Health Service Executive that the Wicklow Local Health Office is in the process of completing its level 2 business plan which will set out the services to be delivered in 2008, including Mental Health, Primary Care, Disabilities, and Children &amp; Families services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">The recruitment pause put in place in September 2007 was initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan to facilitate the delivery of services on budget in accordance with the provisions of the 2007 National Service Plan.  This pause did not involve random job cuts but did mean that the recruitment of staff to approved positions was delayed.  The HSE put in place a derogation process to deal with the filling of essential posts to protect front-line services and close to 900 posts were approved under this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">This temporary pause in recruitment ended on 31st December 2007 and any posts falling vacant from 1st January 2008 can be filled subject to the provisions of a detailed employment control circular issued by the HSE on January 8th.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">It is very important that measures are in place in 2008 to avoid a repetition of the problems encountered in 2007.  In my letter to the Chairman of the HSE approving the 2008 National Service Plan, I have emphasised that the evident links between the Voted allocation, approved employment levels and service activity — within the HSE itself and in HSE funded agencies such as the major voluntary hospitals — need to be planned and actively managed from the very start of the year with appropriate action being taken in the event of any divergence from profile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">It is only through this integrated and managed approach that the HSE will be able to ensure that resources for services (including staffing) are directed as intended by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1325">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 46, 59, 72 and 135 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">The Health Service Executive  recently published a Review of Acute Bed Capacity carried out  by PA Consulting together with a HSE discussion document  which proposes an integrated approach to health service delivery that seeks to achieve the right balance between in-patient, day case and community based care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">The Review found that with future challenges, such as our ageing population and the increase in chronic diseases, we  will need to plan for a 60% increase in demand for health care by 2020.  It suggests that if current practices and processes continue the demand for public hospital beds would escalate to nearly 20,000 by 2020.  To meet this need we would have to provide the equivalent of twelve new 600-bed hospitals over the next thirteen years.   It concludes that such reliance on acute hospitals for service delivery is neither sustainable nor in the best interests of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">The Review examined alternative approaches to meeting this demand.  It recommends an integrated approach to health service delivery involving substantial change in the way care is provided.  Among the measures proposed are significant increases in day beds in hospitals, more long-term care beds, more rehabilitation beds and more services in community-based, non-acute hospital settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">The Review outlines a number of bed demand scenarios.  It suggests that if the proposed model of integrated health service delivery was 100% operational by 2020, the number of acute beds required could be reduced to about 8,800.  If the model was 75% operational, the number would be about 10,700; at 50% the number is estimated at about 13,000 and at 25% the number is about 16,000.  It makes the point that other developed countries, such as Australia, Canada, Denmark and England have achieved results of this kind through their reform programmes.  It also points out that some of our hospitals are already achieving the required efficiencies, such as shorter lengths of stay, more day surgery and admission on day of surgery.  The challenge is to achieve these standards of service across the entire acute system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Pending the implementation of such reforms, the Review estimates that 1,100 additional acute hospital beds are needed to meet current demand.  The Government has already committed itself to providing 1,500 extra acute beds through a combination of  direct capital investment (500 beds) and the co location initiative (1,000 beds).</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">The Review also advises that services in acute hospitals should not be altered until viable and appropriate community based alternatives are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">I believe that the Review forms a basis for discussion with key stakeholders on how best to plan for the provision of public health care delivery to 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_1367">The most effective strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer requires decisions based on an assessment  of the relative contributions of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening in reducing the burden of both existing and projected cervical precancerous changes and cervical cancer.  Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups and for differing levels of screening provision and uptake.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">The vaccine against HPV that is licensed for use within the European Union protects recipients against 4 types of HPV, including types 16 and 18 that cause 70% of cervical cancers and two other types that cause most genital warts. While it is 100% effective against types 16 and 18, there will remain at least 30% of women whose cancers will not be prevented with this vaccine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has  undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS), agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study. When I have received the results of this work I will then be in a position to take the necessary policy decisions based on the best available national and international evidence. In the meantime, the NCSS is planning to roll-out the National Cervical Screening Programme on a national basis around the middle of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1380">Under Section 31 of the Health Act, 2004 the Health Service Executive must prepare and submit its annual National Service Plan for the coming year to the Minister for approval. The National Service Plan (NSP) must indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the Health Service Executive for the financial resources provided in its Vote.  The format and content of the NSP has been improved and refined over the last number of years.  A great deal of effort was deployed to the development and synthesis of the NSP 2008 by the HSE and I would like to express my public appreciation for the hard work of all the HSE officials concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">The NSP is focussed on providing quantifiable data for planned service outputs for the inputs/resources being used and the progress of the Plan through the year is monitored by way of detailed monthly and quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports submitted by the HSE to the Department.  The quarterly reports in particular detail progress on all actions/deliverables that are included in the NSP.  The NSP also embeds more than 30 selected indicators/measures that can be used to assess the performance of the HSE in relation to the NSP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">High level quarterly service plan meetings are held between Department and HSE management teams to discuss progress on the implementation of the NSP and to raise and resolve significant issues.  In addition to these formal arrangements, there is ongoing contact and dialogue between the various sections in the Department and the relevant directorates in the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">The NSP for 2008 was submitted on 19th November, 2007.  In accordance with the Health Act, I approved the Plan on 10 December, 2007. In my letter of approval to the HSE, I requested the Board of the HSE to pay particular attention in 2008 to the absolute necessity for the HSE to operate within the limits of its Voted allocation in delivering, at minimum, the levels of service activity specified in the 2008 Service Plan. Clearly, this means that the Voted allocations, approved employment levels and service activities — both within the HSE itself and in HSE funded agencies such as the major voluntary hospitals — all need to be planned and actively and prudently managed from the very start of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">I do not propose to go into any of the details of the Service Plan here as it was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 December 2007 and, accordingly, is readily available to all Deputies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">Considerable additional funds, over and above those provided in the Estimates, are being made available to the HSE in 2008 as a result of the December Budget Day announcements. These additional funds are being provided for the further development of specific nominated additional services in 2008. At my request, the HSE has provided me with an Addendum to the National Service Plan setting out how the Executive intends to fund and to deliver these additional services and service enhancements in 2008. That addendum is under consideration within my Department at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1394">There are currently 12 GP vocational training programmes in the State and these programmes are accredited by the ICGP.  The HSE has indicated that there have been capacity issues within these training programmes and that this is the principal reason that it has not been possible to increase the number of training places as quickly as had been hoped.  I understand that the HSE has been working closely with the ICGP with a view to addressing these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Under Section 86 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the HSE has responsibility inter alia for the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">Promoting the development of specialist medical education and training;</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">Co-ordinating such developments in co-operation with the Medical Council and the medical training bodies;</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">Undertaking appropriate medical workforce planning for the purpose of meeting specialist medical staffing and training needs, in co-operation with the medical training bodies and after consultation with the Higher Education Authority;</p>

            <p eId="para_1400">Therefore, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address the matters raised and to have replies issued directly to the Deputies.</p>

         the reason she has departed from the policy as recommended in the report of the development of the mental health services A Vision for Change that the release of substantial resources both revenue and capital tied up in residual psychiatric institutions should form a significant part of the investment required in funding the new model of care; and if she will make a statement on asset loss and diversion of hospital buildings and lands from the mental health services.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1402">"A Vision for Change" the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which was launched in January 2006, has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services. The vision embodied in this policy is to create a mental health system that addresses the needs of the population through a focus on the requirements of the individual. The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all mental hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service. The Health Service Executive has primary responsibility for implementing this recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">I assume the Deputy is referring to "The Lie of the Land" Report recently launched by the Irish Psychiatric Association. The Report gives examples of proceeds of assets allegedly lost to psychiatric services over a 20-25 year period. A small number of assets disposed of in the past two years are identified. "A Vision for Change" is very clear on this issue and recommends that resources, both capital and revenue, should be retained in the mental health service, with the reconfigured mental health services having priority in their disposal. It also recommends that the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands should be professionally assessed towards identifying appropriate future use and maximum value and benefit. The value of these assets significantly counter balances the capital cost of the new mental health services infrastructure requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney has also made it clear to the HSE in the context of their Service Plan for 2008 that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in relation to core services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">I have asked the HSE to provide me with a report on "The Lie of the Land" Report particularly insofar as it relates to the disposal of assets in the past two years.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1407">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €90 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1415">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 41, 68 and 133 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">I acknowledge the need to improve services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  The negative experience recounted by some patients is a matter of much concern to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition and included representation from my Department, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Group idenitified a range of service improvements required for persons with Cystic Fibrosis, including the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in Cystic Fibrosis units around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">Arising from the Pollock Report and the emerging recommendations of the Working Group, I identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in the Estimates process. In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of €6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St Vincent's, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital. A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities. These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus Ward, and a new Accident and Emergency Department which includes single room accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">However, it is accepted that these developments do not fully address the immediate needs of patients. The HSE has been working intensively with the Hospital and with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improvements. My Department is advised that the option of developing a modular unit is being examined in this context and the position will be clarified shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">The HSE advises that it is fast-tracking the re-development of a ward which is adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area. The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms. On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms. The HSE advise that this will result in a total of fourteen single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation. The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.  Planning permission has been obtained and financial provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan. The HSE advises that contract notices will be published by the end of February 2008 and the contract is to be awarded in 2008. It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of €2.5m capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont hospital to provide out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">An independent registry for cystic fibrosis has been established.  As yet, the data is not available to fully inform analysis relating to median survival in this country. When it is available, the data from the Registry will allow for benchmarking against comparable countries around the world to measure the performance of our healthcare system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1427">The Health Service Executive (HSE) established an Orthodontic Review Group in 2006.

            <p eId="para_1432">The Orthodontic Review Group finalised its report last year. One of the recommendations contained in the report relates to the guidelines issued in 1985. The Review Group made a unanimous recommendation to the HSE to replace these guidelines with new assessment criteria based on Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (ITON). The national implementation of the proposed guidelines will ensure equity of access to treatment for all patients deemed eligible. The Review Group report has been approved by the HSE's Management Team, and it is a matter for the HSE to implement these guidelines. Orthodontics is one of a number of oral health issues which will be examined as part of the development of the National Oral Health Policy, which I am committed to publishing this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1434">There are a number of initiatives currently undertaken that aim to tackle fuel poverty.  Sustainable Energy Ireland, together with a number of government departments and agencies, is involved in a research project investigating the impacts of undertaking energy efficiency improvements in low-income households.  This research involves 600 homes in Cork and Donegal.

            <p eId="para_1435">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also undertaken initiatives to address fuel poverty.  The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme which was introduced in November 2007, and is administered by the local authorities, provides targeted support to assist older people in carrying out necessary repairs and improvements.  The provision of central heating and associated insulation works may be considered for grant aid under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">In addition, older people will benefit from the central heating programme introduced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in July 2004.

            <p eId="para_1442">At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances. Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means. The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services. In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards. For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">My Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible. As part of this general review, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of economic / financial, medical and social need is being undertaken with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card, and is expected to be completed by Autumn, 2008.</p>

The Programme is also in discussion with the Irish Cancer Society in relation to this issue and has reached agreement on the administration by the Society of a hardship related transport scheme, to be funded by the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">The HSE is also putting in place a structured programme of quality assurance, support and information services to underpin the re-organisation of services to ensure that cancer patients will receive quality services as close to home as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1455">As the Deputy may be aware, the draft National Standards for services for people with disabilities, which were produced by my Department in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA) were forwarded to the interim Health Information and Quality Authority (iHIQA) in March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Following the statutory establishment of HIQA, the development of standards is a matter for that Authority. However I can tell the Deputy that a 'Standards Advisory Group' was put in place by HIQA to consider the development of service specific standards including residential and community based services for people with disabilities in residential centres. The membership of the Standards Advisory Group is representative of a broad range of agencies and advocates within the disability sector.  The membership includes the National Disability Authority, Not for Profit Business Association, Inclusion Ireland, National Parents and Siblings Alliance, the Life Sharing Alliance, People with Disabilities in Ireland, Health Service Executive, Psychological Society of Ireland, National Economic and Social Council, National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, St Joseph's Parents Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, An Bord Altranais, Mental Health Commission, HIQA, a number of  service users and my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">In tandem with the development of service specific standards, I understand that HIQA is due to commence recruiting and training of personnel to build capacity to be in a position, when appropriate, to carry out inspections of services.  I understand that a set of draft standards will be available for public consultation in the second quarter of 2008 and completed later in the year.  A published set of standards is expected by the end of 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1472">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which, together with the earlier Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), are implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced from 1st January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  In addition, transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">When I announced the new scheme in July of last year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was to be forwarded to my Office in November and December as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed last month and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government:</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 is being introduced;</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which would otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.</p>

The IDA was advised of the legal situation and, in January, 2007, discussions on the fee aspects of the review were temporarily put on hold. It is clear now from discussions between officials of my Department and the Attorney General's Office, that there are complex legal difficulties associated with the traditional process for the negotiation of professional fees and that a new approach, in line with Competition Law, must be found.

            <p eId="para_1499">At the time of the drafting of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, children detained in St. Patrick's Institution were excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman for Children for a number of reasons.   Firstly, the Ombudsman Act 1980 exempted prisons and it was decided there should be consistency of approach in the Ombudsman for Children Bill.  Secondly, the remit of the Ombudsman for Children is for persons under 18 years. As St. Partick's Institution does not cater exclusively for children, young adults aged up to 21 years are also detained in this facility, it does not fall within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. The Inspector of Prisons has a remit to inspect all places of detention operated under the aegis of the Irish Prison Service. St. Patrick's Institution comes within this remit.  In addition, there is also a visiting committee appointed to St. Patrick's.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">Children detention schools come within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  Under the amendments to the Children Act 2001, contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, children detention schools will be extended to include all children under 18 years.  Plans are progressing to bring these changes into effect, after which all children under 18 in detention will come within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1509">As the Deputy may be aware, requests for assessment for inter-country adoption are continuously increasing. The recent study on inter-country adoption, undertaken by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for foreign adoption in Europe. In addition, as a result of the increased number of children coming from abroad, a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports from sending countries has been created. Both assessments and post-placement reports are being undertaken by HSE social work staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive. It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences. In a number of areas, the HSE has improved waiting times by contracting assessments out to non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">The HSE has also appointed an outside consultant to undertake a review of the inter-country adoption service. This review is examining staffing, business processes, resources, strengths and options within the service.

I would like to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1519">I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of services to prevent and reduce further tragic loss of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">In September 2005, "Reach Out" — a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched. The strategy provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.   The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy and has taken on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children regarding the "High Levels of Suicide in Irish Society" which are consistent with the actions identified in "Reach Out".</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">Additional funding of €1.85 million was provided in 2007 for the implementation of the Strategy bringing the overall funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to €8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">Initiatives funded by the National Office for Suicide Prevention include developing and implementing national training programmes, completing the availability of self-harm services through A&amp;E departments, developing mental health awareness campaigns, implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services, eleven dedicated suicide officers and supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">It should also be emphasised that a wide range of other expenditure on mental health services generally is of importance in measures to help prevent suicide.  A total of some €1 billion is now spent on mental health services, including consultant psychiatry and psychiatric nursing.  These services play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide, and should be taken into account when examining the level of total public expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.</p>

            <p eId="para_1527">I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 138 and 139 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">I would like to assure the Deputies that tackling Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA and C Difficile, continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  It should be noted that the HSE does not have a remit in relation to private hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">The European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) was established in 1999 in response to the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance in Europe.  In 2007, 43 Irish laboratories serving 64 acute hospitals (public and private) participated in EARSS representing an estimated 98% coverage of the Irish population.  In 2007, by the end of the 3rd Quarter (the most up to date figures available) there were 1,035 isolates of Staphylococcus Aureus blood stream infection of which 432 (41.7%) were MRSA.  The annual trends indicate that the proportion of MRSA in Ireland has levelled off at approximately 42% since 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">Clostridium difficile is not a notifiable disease and, as a result, it is difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  However, Clostridium difficile infection was examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had Clostridium difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.  Clostridium difficile infection increases with age and is eight times more common in patients over 65 years compared to those under the age of 65 years.  The emergence of more virulent strains of Clostridium difficile which is partly due to over use of antibiotics underlines the importance of strict antibiotic stewardship in our health care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">The extent to which hospitals are affected by MRSA varies with the type of hospital.  In the 2006 prevalence survey of healthcare associated infections, the prevalence of MRSA was 0.5% in tertiary/regional and general hospitals, and was zero in specialist hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">A National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our healthcare system:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1533">1. Staphylococcus bacteraemia;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1534">2. Antibiotic consumption;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1535">3. Alcohol gel use;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1536">4. MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">A report on the 2006 data from the system is expected to be made available by the Surveillance Centre in the near future and work has commenced on providing information in respect of 2007.  All of this will greatly assist in the monitoring of improvements in infection control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our hospitals in 2007 against hygiene standards developed by the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board.  HIQA published its report, the National Hygiene Services Quality Review, on 13th November, 2007.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  Hospitals generally performed well on hygiene in the service delivery area.  Most hospitals achieved either extensive or exceptional compliance with the standard in the service delivery section of the report.  However, the results were poor on governance.  While the good hygiene practice of front line staff highlighted in the report is vital, real improvement in this whole area also depends heavily on good leadership and a system of governance.  HIQA is currently working with managers and clinicians to develop national standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  When completed these, along with the national hygiene standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to help reduce the spread of infection and improve the quality of our health care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">The availability of isolation facilities is an important factor in the overall solution to the issue of reducing incidence of infection.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA and this policy has been adopted by the HSE.  New environmental building guidelines are being prepared by the HSE to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments and the HSE is committed to ensuring that such facilities are in line with best international practice including the provision of adequate numbers of single units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infections and to treat them promptly when they occur.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">The Report 'Early Detection in Cancer: A Needs Assessment of General Practitioners' was a joint study involving the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  The aim of the study was to identify the barriers experienced by General Practitioners to early diagnosis of cancer in order to improve early detection, increase the number of patients diagnosed at an early stage and maximise potential for cure.  The key findings of the study include a need for increased patient awareness, improved communications with hospitals, further education and clinical practice guidelines on identification of early stage cancer, appropriate investigative pathways and referral criteria for suspected cancer and identification and screening of 'high risk individuals' and elimination of inequity between public and private patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">I am firmly of the view that cancer patients should be seen and treated solely on the basis of medical priority.  The implementation of the National Cancer Control Programme will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome.  The recent decisions of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The Programme will identify gaps in the provision of existing services, address regional disparities in cancer treatment, and develop a national approach to timely access to diagnostic services for cancer.  Prof. Keane, Director of the Programme, has already made significant progress in this regard.  He has met with the President of the Irish College of General Practitioners and has received support for his plan to develop a national mechanism for referral of patients into the eight designated centres.  In addition, the Lead Consultant Surgeons in the eight designated breast cancer centres have agreed to a common referral process for breast cancer and will institute policy changes in relation to follow up practice.</p>

In my letter to the Chairman of the HSE approving the 2008 National Service Plan, I have emphasised that the evident links between the Voted allocation, approved employment levels and service activity — within the HSE itself and in HSE funded agencies such as the major voluntary hospitals — need to be planned and actively managed from the very start of the year with appropriate action being taken in the event of any divergence from profile.   In this regard, I understand that, under the Circular 01/2008, Area Employment Monitoring Groups have been established in each of the 4 administrative areas to ensure that monthly reports in respect of new or replacement staff being entered onto the payroll are rigorously assessed to determine whether any remedial action is necessary to ensure services are operated fully within budget.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Noel Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1596">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 to 90, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">The Government has assigned responsibility as lead Agency for the implementation of its policy in respect of flood risk management to the Office of Public Works as recommended by the review group.  The policy being pursued is fully in line with the recommendations of the review group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">The provision for flood risk management in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is €382m. The provision for this year is €50m. Expenditure last year amounted to €23.115m.  In addition to the capital provision, there is a provision in the OPW vote in 2008 of €22m for Channel maintenance and other work programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">The Department of Finance sanctioned the appointment of an additional 30 staff to enable the Office of Public Works to implement the recommendations of the report. The process of filling these posts is complex and is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">OPW is pro actively developing a range of non-structural measures to mitigate the effects of existing flood risk and to prevent the creation of future flood risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">A website, www.floodmaps.ie, which shows details of records of flooding throughout the State for more than 100 years has been developed and is accessible to the public. Planning Authorities are in a position to access more detailed information in relation to flood risk through the website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">Measures taken to date to raise the general level of public awareness of flooding as an issue include running a number of public awareness campaigns including the distribution of an information booklet and the setting up of a website www.flooding.ie, which contains information and advice under the headings Plan, Prepare, Protect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">OPW was actively involved, in co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in the negotiation of the EU Floods Directive and will continue to be responsible in co-operation with the Department for the implementation of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">Pilot Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Studies [CFRAMS] are currently in progress in respect of the Rivers Lee, Dodder and Suir Catchments.  Tenders are currently being sought for the Finglas/East Meath Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study. Progress on this programme is ahead of the requirements of the EU Directive, which requires that CFRAMS for all River Basins be completed by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">A project to update the hydrometric and hydrological methodologies and data used by engineers and designers, is at an advanced stage and will be completed and published this year. OPW has also carried out a review of it's own hydrometric stations to ensure that adequate data will be available in the future, to monitor flood risk and to inform decision making where action may be required in response to evidence of increased risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">OPW is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to develop a guidance document on the consideration of flood risk in the planning and development process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">OPW is also working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to develop a guidance document outlining best practice in respect of the emergency management of a flood event.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">OPW has initiated a review of the legislation under which it currently deals with flood risk management issues to determine what changes may be necessary to enable it to discharge the full range of its responsibilities in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">OPW is examining the criteria and processes that will be required to enable rivers, channels and flood defence assets to be designated for future maintenance where it is considered appropriate on economic, social or environmental grounds to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">All of OPW's major structural flood relief schemes are currently subjected to Cost Benefit Analysis. OPW has developed draft prioritisation criteria to enable it to prioritise between different elements of its work programme to make best use of staff, financial or other resources.  The process of striking the right balance between economic, social, environmental and other considerations is extremely complex and further research is needed before this work is completed. It is expected that this task will be concluded this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">OPW has established an Environmental Unit within the Engineering Services Division to advise in relation to the environmental considerations arising from its structural and non structural work programmes and to assist in ensuring that the best environmental options are selected, and where possible, environmental enhancement measures are incorporated in flood risk management measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">OPW has established a high level steering committee to co-ordinate the implementation of its flood management work programme. Met Éireann are represented on the committee.  The possibility of OPW providing assistance to Met Éireann to help improve flood forecasting has been discussed but no specific measures have been identified to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">OPW is also engaged in a programme of structural flood relief measures to alleviate existing flooding problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">The following flood relief works have been completed or are in progress since 2000 under the flood relief programme:</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">Mulkear River, Cappamore, Co. Limerick</p>

            <p eId="para_1629">New Ross</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">Spencer Dock</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">The first phase of Flood Relief Schemes for Ennis, Clonmel, Carlow, Mallow and Fermoy are at varying stages of the tender process at present and will commence this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">Detailed Design work on subsequent phases of these schemes will commence this year and it is anticipated that construction of schemes will commence in 2009 / 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">Flood Relief Schemes for Waterford, Woodford and the Dunkellin river and Mornington are at an advanced stage of design and it is anticipated that work on these schemes will also commence this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">Flood Relief Schemes for Templemore, Raphoe, Letterkenny, River Liffey (South Quays), Enniscorthy, Tullow, Bray, Arklow, Portarlington, Piltown, and Tullamore are at various stages of the design process. While it is too early at this stage to say when work on site will commence, it is anticipated it will be possible to commence work on most of these projects in 2009 or 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">In addition to the works listed above OPW is also engaged in assisting Local Authorities though the provision of advice, funding or the execution of works as appropriate in each case, to deal with localised flooding problems where economic, social and environmental considerations support such measures.  OPW also maintains an extensive network of watercourses, which were improved under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, to maintain them in proper repair and effective condition.  There is considerable evidence that this contributes to the prevention of flooding in areas drained by these watercourses.</p>

            <p eId="para_1637">Up to 2006, DIRT was deducted from a customer's deposit interest regardless of whether or not the customer was actually liable to tax. At the end of each year some account holders, provided they met certain conditions, were entitled to claim a refund from Revenue of any DIRT deducted during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">Section 34 of the Finance Act 2007 introduced a new scheme to allow the operation of DIRT exempt savings accounts subject to two conditions: the account holder must be aged 65 years of age or over or be permanently incapacitated and their total income must not exceed the relevant exemption threshold, i.e. in 2007 €19,000 (for an individual) or €38,000 (for a married couple).</p>

            <p eId="para_1646">From the details supplied by the Deputy, it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to comment on the actual case.  However, the general position is as follows.  Tax relief at source (TRS) is granted on a secured loan used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of a principal private residence. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an individual wishing to register for TRS on mortgage interest payments should complete the relevant form TRS1 available at www.revenue.ie and return it to Revenue. Alternatively, an individual can register online at www.revenue.ie/trs 1.</p>

            <p eId="para_1649">The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive, Member States can only apply the standard VAT rate to fuel. In Ireland the standard VAT rate is 21%.  Any reduction VAT paid on a litre of fuel for fishing vessels would have to apply to all goods and services subject to the standard VAT rate. For example, a one percentage reduction in the standard VAT rate would cost the Exchequer approximately €483 million in a full year and make little or no difference to the price of fuel for fishing vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">In relation to capping the amount of VAT paid on a litre of fuel for fishing vessels, the EU VAT Directive sets out the method through which VAT must be calculated which has been transposed from the VAT Directive by section 10 of the Value Added Tax Act 1972 as follows: "...the total consideration which the person supplying goods or services becomes entitled to receive in respect of or in relation to such supply of goods or services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever, but not including value-added tax chargeable in respect of the supply".

            <p eId="para_1658">"A Vision for Change"  provides a framework of 7-10 years for the development of mental health services, including services for children and adolescents.

Implementation of these recommendations is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">A total of €11.2 million revenue funding has been provided to the HSE over 2006 and 2007 for the development of child and adolescent services.

In 2008 the HSE plan to recruit 8 additional child and adolescent mental health teams and  commission 18 additional beds for children and adolescents, 14 of which will be for children over 16 years. Construction of two 20 bed units in Cork and Galway  is also expected to commence in 2008.</p>

My Office is drafting a bill to amend Part IVA of the Child Care Act 1991 to provide a statutory scheme for the High Court to have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear Special Care cases. The Heads of this bill were approved by the Cabinet and the drafting of legislation is proceeding. (ii) Sections 5 to 13 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007, which amended Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991, enabled regulations to be made which would allow school age childcare services to be brought within the 1991 Act on the same basis as pre-school child care services.

Due to Constitutional difficulties an agreement with Belarus is very unlikely and, in that light, negotiations have concluded. I appreciate very much that this is disappointing for the prospective adoptive parents involved. However, the authorities in Belarus, as in all "sending" States, must retain the absolute prerogative with regard to what children may be adopted, and what requirements must be satisfied to ensure children's best interests have been central to any decision regarding their placement and adoption at home or abroad. The Deputy will appreciate this is the same prerogative and minimum standard we require within the Irish State in respect of Irish children being placed for adoption in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1734">As part of the ongoing roll out of the Health Reform Programme, my Department is  responsible for overall organisational, legislative, policy and financial accountability for the health sector. The Health Service Executive (HSE) was established in January, 2005 and is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Policy for the delivery of health services is concerned with development of health services in all regions of the country, capable of providing safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients whether in primary care settings or when accessing a hospital service. My Department is informed by a broad range of strategy documents and associated policies to guide it in that work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The Health Reform Programme comprehends Quality and Fairness — The National Health Strategy, The Primary Care Strategy as well as the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly reports. These reports are guiding the future of the health service in that they lay out the overall direction for the major changes in the health services and how they should be addressed and delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">Under the Health Act, 2004, a core responsibility of the Department is that of holding the HSE to account in relation to its financial performance and performance of service delivery, as well as the effective implementation of Government policies. A number of Expert Advisory Groups (EAGs) have also been established by the HSE and are  located within its organisational structure in order to provide strategic leadership and expertise in the development and interpretation of national policy, strategies and service design in the delivery of health and personal social services. The EAGs are made up of a wide range of health professionals and will verify compliance with policy and legislation, monitor appropriate resource utilisation and ensure national consistency in implementation and service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">Another contributor to policy development in the delivery of health services is the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). HIQA will undertake health technology assessments and will evaluate information on health and social services and the health and welfare of the population, and advise the Minister and the HSE on these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Government policy in relation to health will continue to be guided by various strategic and policy documents and the recommendations which they contain, while taking into account the growing evidence base nationally and internationally on best practice  in healthcare, and the requirement that the patient and their needs be at the centre of service development.</p>

            <p eId="para_1741">The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of  general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years. I understand that the HSE has recently sought expressions of interest from the private sector for the provision of the Primary Care Team infrastructure, with the HSE proposing to enter into fixed term leases with such providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1763">The Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering the Repayment Scheme and the information sought by the Deputy relates to matters within the area of responsibility of the Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">The HSE has informed my Department that over 36,000 applications for living and deceased patients have been received by the Health Repayment Scheme. To date in excess of 16,500 of the claims received by the Scheme Administrator have been processed, which includes 9,471 offers of repayment totalling more than €180 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">I have been advised that the Scheme Administrator has given assurances to the HSE that the vast majority of claims submitted by the public will be dealt with within the 2 year time frame allotted for the Scheme which is due to end in June 2008. The HSE has indicated that if there are any outstanding claims at the end of June 2008 such claims will be kept to an absolute minimum and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">The HSE have informed my Department that the scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to settle claims as quickly as possible.  However, there are a number of different factors which have affected the length of time it takes to process a claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">A very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must be rectified before they can be processed. Over 13,400 estates who have lodged claims to date did not have a grant of representation, as required by law, and the Scheme Administrator has had to establish probate before the claim can be progressed. This is to ensure that the person entitled to claim on behalf of an estate is the person who ultimately receives the repayment.  Over 330 HSE facilities around the country have had to be visited by the Scheme Administrator to review and retrieve their records of payment.  In some cases, these records dated as far back as 1976.  The format in which this information was stored varied widely between institutions and usually included a mixture of paper files, handwritten files and computer files. All of this information had to be scanned and uploaded onto a usable database and this process took over 6 months to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">In an effort to address some of the issues mentioned above, the HSE and the Scheme Administrator conducted an intensive national roadshow campaign in nine locations around the country  (Dublin, Dundalk, Waterford, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Athlone and Cavan) in the run up to the deadline last year. The open days resulted in positive progress in resolving deficiencies and progressing applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">The HSE have informed my Department that the Scheme Administrator and the HSE continue to work closely together in dealing with issues under the scheme as they arise.</p>

HIQA propose to develop such standards for acute hospitals in 2008.  The standards will, in the first instance, be generic across the acute hospital sector.

            <p eId="para_1786">The National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre at Cork University Hospital was established in 2006 under a service level agreement with the HSE.  The aim of this centre is to improve clinical services for mothers and babies by monitoring all data from Irish maternity units.  The role of the centre is to record, monitor and analyse all births, important interventions, complications and outcomes.  The priorities for the Centre are the development of a national maternity chart for Ireland and standardised data collection across all maternity units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">The development of a single maternity chart for use in all of the State's hospitals and units should offer benefits such as improved harmonisation of data collection from different hospitals, facilitation of better patient movement between hospitals and co-ordination of a perinatal epidemiology monitoring service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1855">My Department supports the use of the Port Tunnel by any bus operator, whether it is Dublin Bus, Bus Eireann or a private operator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">On the 22nd March, 2007, Dublin Bus notified my Department of its proposal to re-route four of its existing Route 41X services from Swords via the Port Tunnel. At that time, my Department advised the Company that the proposal was in conflict with a prior application from a private operator for a high frequency bus service from Swords to the City Centre via the Port Tunnel.  Therefore, in accordance with legislative procedures, Dublin Bus was advised that a decision on its proposal was being deferred until the prior application was finalised. Applications from private bus operators and notifications from the State Companies are dealt with on a first come basis and Dublin Bus is aware of these procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">The prior application was finalised and my Department issued a licence on the 3rd October, 2007 to the private operator concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">The Department is currently considering the Dublin Bus proposal taking into consideration the introduction of the newly licensed service and the matter has been the subject of ongoing contact with Dublin Bus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">An issue such as that which has arisen in relation to the Route 41X only occurs where my Department considers that the proposal conflicts with a prior application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">My Department has previously approved Dublin Bus to operate the Route 33X (Skerries — City Centre) and Route 142 (Portmarnock- Malahide- City Centre — Rathmines) service via the Port Tunnel. My Department has no other outstanding proposals from Dublin Bus for services that would utilise the Port Tunnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_1865">In the year 2000, Ireland and the United Kingdom were granted the right to participate in some proposals that build upon the Schengen acquis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">In February and May 2004, the United Kingdom signalled its intention to take part in the adoption of Regulation 2007/2004 (EC) on the establishment of FRONTEX, and Regulation 2252/2004 (EC) on biometric passports. Both measures were intended to build on the provisions of Article 62(2) (a) of the Schengen acquis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">The Council subsequently refused to allow the United Kingdom to take part in these measures on the grounds that they constituted a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis to which the United Kingdom was not a party by virtue of Council Decision 2000/365 (EC).</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">The United Kingdom launched legal challenges through the European Court of Justice with a view to enabling it to participate fully in both regulations. In May 2005, the Government authorised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to present to the Court Ireland's written observations in relation to these cases. Subsequently Ireland, together with Poland and Slovakia, intervened at the court in support of the United Kingdom. Spain and the Commission were given leave by the Court to intervene in support of the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">The Judgements of the European Court of Justice were handed down on 18 December 2007 in which the court ruled that the Council was correct in refusing to allow the United Kingdom the right to take part in adopting the measures in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1976">I understand that a restructuring of the manufacturing activities of the company in question will lead to a cessation of production at its biscuit factory in Tallaght by early 2009.  The planned restructuring will include an investment programme and the company expects to employ 120 people at that stage in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1977">Enterprise Ireland has had a number of discussions with the company over the last twelve months in relation to its development plans, and assistance has also been given to the company's innovation agenda. After reviewing a number of options, the company has now taken the strategic decision to outsource its biscuit manufacturing operation. However, the company has also indicated its commitment to undertaking new product development in Ireland by deciding to establish an innovation centre of excellence in biscuit manufacturing.  The agency will seek to continue working with the company to assist it to develop new products and processes, and enhance its famous range of brands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">The redundancies at the company will take place on a phased basis from September 2008, through to early 2009. The role of FÁS, the Industrial Training agency, will be particularly important.  The agency has already written to the company and a response is currently awaited as to how and when the company wishes to proceed.  The agency is prepared to offer its full range of services to any employees who wish to avail of its services.  I am aware of the significance of the job losses in such a long established company and every effort will be made to assist the employees.  I understand the company is entering into talks with employees and unions immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">The State Development agencies will continue to work together and with local interests to promote employment opportunities for Tallaght.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued in the area by the agencies will maximise the flow of potential investors and convert these into investment and job opportunities.  The development of the Grangecastle Business Park, which Microsoft Corporation has selected for its new data centre, combined with the development of the City West Business Park will ensure that the overall area is an attractive location for investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1981">The number of complaints received in 2007 in respect of property management companies was 64, a 146% increase on the previous year's figure of 26.  This increase is likely to have been prompted by the publication of the ODCE's Consultation Paper on the Governance of Apartment Owners' Management Companies in December 2006, the attendant media interest in the subject and also the fact that there is an increasing number of people living in apartments in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">I am pleased that the Director of Corporate Enforcement successfully rectified difficulties in 43 of these cases by contacting the directors in question.  21 other cases are continuing to be assessed at year-end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">The enforcement of breaches of company law by property management companies, as with any companies, is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement. I understand that the Director is producing a Governance Handbook for property management companies in order to raise awareness of the responsibilities and rights that apartment owners have as members of such companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1986">In line with the Tánaiste's announcement, my Department was asked to provide the Department of Finance, by 1 March 2008, with a list of specific actionable proposals to maximise efficiencies gains in spending areas under the aegis of my Department.  An exercise to identify potential efficiencies in my Department, its Offices and its agencies is currently being carried out and will be completed in time to meet the 1 March deadline set by the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">The exercise is being conducted by relevant staff of my Department, its Offices and agencies as part of their day-to-day activities.  The salary and overhead costs of these staff are included as part of my Department's budget for 2008.  Therefore, no specific additional costs have arisen at this point in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">It is envisaged that proposals which my Department forwards to the Department of Finance under the Efficiency Review will be considered by the Tánaiste and the Government, along with proposals from other Departments.

            <p eId="para_1997">I have been advised by the Registrar General that the position is as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">The provisions governing the registration of births are contained in Part 3 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004. Section 22 (3) provides that, where the mother was married at the date of the birth of the child or at some time during the period of 10 months ending immediately before such birth, and where it is maintained that the legal spouse is not the father, there must be given to the registrar either a statutory declaration from the spouse rebutting paternity of the child, or a statutory declaration of the mother that she has been living apart from the spouse during a period ending immediately before the date of the birth of the child of more than 10 months by virtue  of a decree of divorce, a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro, a decree of nullity or a deed of separation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">Subsection 22(1)(<i>d</i>) provides for applications to register the father’s particulars where there is provided to the registrar a document purporting to be a copy of an order made by a court in proceedings referred to in section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987, and to be certified by or on behalf of the court to be a true copy of the order, finding that the person is the father of the child. The orders referred to are maintenance orders and orders relating to guardianship, for which applications may be made to local District Family Law Courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">These provisions stem from section 46 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, which provides that the husband in a legally subsisting marriage shall be presumed to be the father of all children of the marriage, unless the contrary is proved on balance of probability. The statutory declarations and court orders referred to above are required in order to set aside the presumption of paternity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">In the case (details supplied) that is the subject of the Deputy's question, the mother is still legally married to the father and is not in a position to obtain from her legal spouse a statutory declaration rebutting paternity. Consequently, she was informed by the registrar that a court order, naming the father of the child, is required under the legislation, in order to disprove the presumption of paternity and effect registration of the child's birth. To date, no such order has been supplied to the registrar. Once a copy of such an order is presented to the registrar, registration may be completed very shortly thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2012">I understand from contact with the Deputy that he is interested in the accounting systems in use in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2013">The Department produces two statutory accounts annually. These two accounts — the Appropriation Account and the Social Insurance Fund account — are subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Their annual outturn for 2006 was €7.3 billion and €7.7 billion respectively. This is the last year for which full information is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">These receipts and payments are brought to account using our financial and accounting system known as Oracle Financials, which is used widely across the public and private sectors and supports the normal range of accounting functions such as General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Inventory and Fixed Assets. The system was initially acquired in 1998 at a cost of €480,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">A separate query and reporting tool known as Business Objects was also implemented in tandem with Oracle Financials to provide management reporting facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">While there has been no specific review of Oracle Financials since it was implemented, the system is monitored on an ongoing basis and has been upgraded regularly to keep up with emerging business needs. The most recent upgrade in 2006 was implemented at a cost of €235,000. Planning for the next upgrade will commence this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">An integral part of the accounting process is the reconciliation of the sixty two million payment transactions carried out by the Department each year through the banks and Post Offices.  Systems supporting the existing reconciliation operations have been in place since 1986.  Following an in-depth review of these processes with expert consultancy assistance costing €127,000, a decision was taken in 2005 to seek a modern integrated solution to replace existing reconciliation systems.  After an extensive competitive tendering and evaluation process the most suitable solution was selected and a contract was awarded in 2007.  Phased implementation is now under way with planned completion in 2009.  The costs of the new system over 2008 and 2009 are projected to be €3.7 million (excluding VAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">In parallel with the new reconciliation project, a consultancy contract has been awarded to provide the Department's Accounts Division with essential additional expertise in business re-engineering, risk management and enhanced financial controls. The projected cost of this additional expertise over a two year period is projected to be €900,000 (excluding VAT). It is also clear that these and other modernisation initiatives will not only underpin a more effective accounting systems but will yield savings in excess of these initial costs over their lifetime particularly in terms of  the ongoing staff resources required to support these systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">The Department's Vote also funds five statutory bodies which come under the aegis of my Department. The organisations are Citizens Information Board, Combat Poverty Agency, Family Support Agency, Pensions Board and Pensions Ombudsman. Responsibility for maintaining proper financial systems and books of account primarily rests with each of the respective organisations under the terms of their governing legislation and such arrangements are subject to separate regular scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

            <p eId="para_2022">The primary aim of the awareness campaign will be to communicate the dangers of cocaine use, with a particular focus on so called "recreational cocaine users" in the 15-34 age group.  It will utilise appropriate media, such as social network websites, billboard and bus advertising as well as radio advertising to target this age group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">No specific funding is available from my Department to support the production of a community-based drugs awareness film and, broadly speaking I would favour a coherent approach involving an overall message through the Health Promotion Unit.  Having said that, it is open to community groups to approach the relevant Local or Regional Drugs Task Force for their area in regard to any proposals they might have. Alternatively, an application could be made under the "small grant scheme" of the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund which has a €5,000 maximum level of grant assistance.  Applications under that Fund, which is restricted to particular areas, would be made to the Local Development Group. Contact details for any of these agencies are available from my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2031">The dumping overboard of unwanted fish from a fishing vessel, usually referred to as discarding, is a complex problem and is a feature of many fisheries, particularly those that involve a mix of species (for example, cod, haddock and whiting).  In a mixed fishery, one species may be the target of fishing activity, but other species may be caught accidentally in the fishing gear.  This can result in the unwanted fish being discarded.  Discarding can also occur for economic reasons, i.e., when smaller, less valuable fish are dumped in favour of larger, more marketable ones (a practice known as high-grading).</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">Most of the fish discarded do not survive.  It is frequently the case that these smaller fish are juveniles of the target species or other species caught as a bycatch. As such, their capture in the first instance impacts on the future reproductive capacity of the stock and on the future viability of the fishery.  From a fisheries management perspective, since the amounts discarded are not usually recorded in logbooks and counted against the relevant quota, the real quantities of fish being taken from a stock are not known, and decisions in relation to the prudent management and conservation of the stock are compromised. The issue of high levels of discards in commercial sea fisheries is a global problem.  It is already being addressed at a European level, however, through measures regulating fishing gear, such as adjusting net mesh sizes or requiring acoustic devices to be attached to fishing gear.  Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing for action on the discard issue in the European Union (EU).  During its Presidency of the EU in 2004, Ireland made the theme of "fast tracking the development of environmentally friendly fishing methods a key focus.  A major international conference involving EU member states, Norway and Iceland was held in Dundalk in March 2004 to discuss how to reduce discards in commercial fisheries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">Following further consideration of the issue, a European Commission Communication on a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and discards in European fisheries was presented to Council in June 2007.  The Council adopted a range of conclusions on the Commission proposal and these will determine the agenda on discards at European level for the immediate future.  An effective resolution of the discards issue will likely require a combination of new policy and technical measures.  The development of policy on discards will be driven in part by reviews of existing stock recovery programmes during 2008.  Technical solutions are likely to involve the deployment of more selective gear types, particularly in mixed-stock fisheries.  Because the dynamics of discarding vary, depending on the characteristics of each fishery, any new measures may have to be implemented on a case-specific basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">Ireland will continue to press for progress on this issue, and I am confident that significant improvements can be achieved.  In addition, the current Programme for Government commits to increasing supports to assist fishermen make the change over to more environmentally friendly fishing gear.  I am confident that a combination of technical developments, management strategies and policy changes will assist in reducing the incidence and impact of discarding in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2046">The National Coastal Protection Strategy Studies in pilot areas have been completed and studies are being extended into new areas.

            <p eId="para_2055">Notwithstanding this and the fact that responsibility for the promotion and development of renewable energy rests with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I did meet with the promoters and representatives of the IFA prior to the recent official launch of a bio-refinery project proposed for the South East.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">In 2006 I participated in a Ministerial Task Force which agreed a National Bioenergy Action Plan. In accordance with this plan I subsequently launched a range of measures to stimulate the production of energy crops to complement measures on the demand side such as the major excise relief scheme introduced by the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">The measures introduced include a new National Energy Crop Premium of €80 per hectare, which is payable in addition to the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  I also launched a new Bioenergy Scheme in February 2007 to encourage farmers to grow willow and miscanthus for bioenergy purposes.  Land used for growing energy crops can also benefit from the Single Payment.  I had frequent meetings with farmers' representatives prior to the introduction of these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">With the introduction of the Single Payment, farmers now have the freedom to consider alternative land use options, while maintaining a degree of income stability.  The buoyant market for biofuels and the introduction of new incentives at farm level has encouraged many farmers to consider agricultural production for non-food uses.  Contact with the IFA and other farming groups in relation to non-food crops is continuing as required.</p>

In that regard an advance payment for €1,795.36 issued to the person named on 16 October 2007, based on the 79.69 hectares declared.  A balancing payment for €1,795.35 issued on 3 December 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_2071">The availability of systems of this nature has long been regarded as a priority in my Department.  The system is under constant review and necessary changes are made incrementally as new statutory obligations or business needs arise.  For example, the system has been adjusted to produce new statutory accounts and reports which are required from 2007 under the CAP Financing Regulations while fisheries functions are now being integrated into the system.

            <p eId="para_2083">In October 2007, I announced my intention to survey all parents and students in the school to establish the level and range of provision being sought through Irish or English that will cater for the spectrum of student needs.  I asked the Commission on School Accommodation to conduct the survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">The Commission on School Accommodation formally requested the board of management of the school to provide the names and addresses of parents and students in the school to whom the survey would be distributed.  This followed a meeting between the Commission and the school authorities, at their request.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">However, the board of management then indicated its belief that the provisions of the Data Protection Acts prevented it from supplying the Commission with the names and addresses as requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">I decided, therefore, to place public notice advertisements in local and national newspapers inviting parents of students in the school to write to the Commission on School Accommodation to obtain the survey form.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">I wish to reiterate that I am determined to ensure that the school continues to guarantee an education through the medium of Irish to those students from the Gaeltacht and from Irish speaking homes who wish to be educated through the medium of Irish.  Equally, I wish to ensure that to the greatest extent possible the new Community School should make a contribution to maintenance of Irish as the primary community language.  However, provision also has to be made for those who have no Irish at all or those who, because their Irish is too weak, are unable to learn in classes conducted exclusively through the medium of Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">The survey is intended to give parents of students attending the school, and the students themselves, an opportunity to directly express their views and preferences in relation to the language used in tuition and in other school activities during the course of their post-primary education.  The survey is part of an open process of engagement with all the parents and the students who are attending the school.  Through the survey my Department is seeking to ascertain the needs of all learners, from those that are fluent to those that may not have sufficient fluency to be able to fully engage in the curriculum through Irish.  This has been my clearly stated intention since the survey was announced and I do not share the Deputy's suggestion that there is any level of confusion involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">There has been extensive consultation and communication on this issue between my Department, the board of management of the school and the Joint Trustees of the school since August of last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">Responses to the survey are currently being examined by my Department and the results will be made known in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2096">My Department has issued guidelines to the Management Authorities of second level schools on meeting their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to ensure the safety and health of their employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">The Health and Safety Authority has also issued a Code of Practice on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying. It defines workplace bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at work. An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work but as a once off incident is not considered to be bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">As a supportive resource, teachers can now access an Employee Assistance Service (EAS) specifically tailored to meet their particular needs. The EAS now available to teachers throughout the country is designed to support the health and well-being of teachers which will in turn positively affect work quality and performance. The service will incorporate confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, addictions, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">Services include, single session or short term structured telephone counselling, face to face short term confidential counselling as well as critical incident debriefing. These services are intended to assist individual teachers and school communities to increase psychological resilience, improve communication, develop positive work relationships and enhance well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">A Whole School Evaluation (WSE) was carried out on the school referred to by the Deputy in October 2004.

The 2007 campaign covered walking to school safely, in 2008 the campaign is focused around the topic of Cycling to School Safely.  A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.</p>

            <p eId="para_2180">As part of initial teacher education, student-teachers access modules in special educational needs (SEN) to assist them in meeting the diversity of students in today's inclusive classrooms. Trainee teachers receive instruction with regard to the appropriateness of application of behavioural principles to learning.  The full-time pre-service teacher training courses for the primary education sector (in the Colleges of Education) contain specific elements aimed at enabling all student teachers to recognise and deal with children having special educational needs, such as pupils with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">The level of mandatory engagement of students in relation to SEN varies from College to College, however students may also have the opportunity to take elective modules in this area. The SEN/Educational Psychology content of initial teacher training generally introduces and explains a range of different approaches to a student's individual or behavioural needs, including applied behaviour analysis. As a rule an overview of the different approaches is given, and an explanation of how such approaches would be applied in the classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">In relation to the second level sector, there are elements to both the Higher Diploma in Education and the Education Degree programmes, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on a variety of learning difficulties which pupils may have. The provision in teacher training programmes is consistent with the Government's belief that as each child with autism is unique; such children should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Applied behavioural analysis, or ABA, is one of the methods used in special classes for children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate informs the Department of Education and Science's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention. By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methodologies, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">My Department, therefore, supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that it should be the only method used. Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.  Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has significantly improved in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.</p>

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully qualified professional teachers who have received additional training in autism, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis.  The pilot programme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot programme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism. I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2199">Freedom of movement is a fundamental right of European citizens enshrined in the EC Treaty.  The intention behind this principle is the removal of all internal borders of the EU.  The obligations on Member States to permit the free movement of European citizens are set out in Directive 2004/38/EC  which is transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2200">Provision is made in the Directive for a right of entry (in Article 5) to all Union Citizens to enter the territory of the Member state with the production of ‘a valid identity card or passport'.  The Article further provides that ‘No entry visa or equivalent formality may be imposed'.  The Directive also provides (in Article 27) that ‘ Member States may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of Union citizens', however, these measures ‘shall comply with the principle of proportionality and shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned.  Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures'.  The scope for a Member State to refuse entry to its territory is further restricted to the extent that the ‘personal conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat...' and that ‘ Justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted'.</p>
            <p eId="para_2201">Expulsion decisions by Member States on public policy or public security grounds are similarly restricted and may only be taken on ‘serious grounds' following full consideration of the persons circumstances including ‘how long the individual concerned has resided on its territory, his/her age, state of health, family and economic situation, social and cultural integration ... and the extent of his/her links with the country of origin'.  As can be read from the foregoing,  it is very difficult in EU law to impede the free movement of European Union citizens.  I have concerns in this area and have relayed them to the European Commission. It is essential that something as valuable and important to the success of the EU is not undermined by persons who abuse the privilege.</p>

            <p eId="para_2203">As the Deputy may be aware, the Explosives Act 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  Accordingly, fireworks may not be imported into the State except under an importation licence granted by my Department.  It is long standing policy that these licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by competent and professional operators.  The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which came into effect in August, 2006 to provide for new offences governing the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply.  The amendments also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  Officials of my Department meet, from time to time, with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss issues of mutual concern in relation to the control of fireworks.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, any possible change in Northern Ireland's fireworks policy is a matter for the relevant authorities in that jurisdiction to consider.</p>

That Report recognised the need for a procedure for dealing with complaints of judicial misconduct which, while serious in itself, might not warrant the ultimate sanction of impeachment by the Oireachtas.  Consultations on the proposed Bill have, as is usual in the development of any legislative proposals, taken place with the Office of the Attorney General.  It was also considered prudent, given the particular nature of the subject, to consult with the Chief Justice. While some preliminary views were received, the Chief Justice requested an opportunity to offer further views at a later stage.  The Chief Justice has confirmed that the proposals for a Judicial Council are being examined across the various court jurisdictions and has advised me of progress in that respect.  In that regard, I am advised that there will be a meeting shortly involving the Chief Justice to discuss the details of the proposed structure of the Judicial Council.  I welcome this progress on examination of the proposals and look forward to progressing the necessary legislation in thisrespect.</p>

The opening hours for the station are from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday to Saturday and from 12 noon to 1 p.m. on Sunday.  An increase in the opening hours of Dunboyne Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who are more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.  Local Garda Management report that Dunboyne is patrolled on a 24 hour basis.  Garda personnel assigned throughout the Country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Dunboyne Garda Station will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda members of Joint Policing Committees are aware of the Committees' function with regard to local policing plans.  The Committees provide a forum for consultations, discussions and recommendations on policing issues of local concern.  Those consultations, discussions and recommendations inform as appropriate the formulation of Garda local policing plans.  Following completion of the evaluation of the operation of the Committees in the pilot phase, revised guidelines will be drafted, taking into account the outcome of the evaluation and the experience of the pilot Committees.  Following consultations with my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I intend to issue as soon as possible revised guidelines to enable roll out of the Committees to all local authority areas in the State.  The guidelines will provide <i>inter alia</i> a timetable for the roll-out.  As the revised guidelines will be the output of the evaluation, it is not intended to publish the evaluation’s findings as such.</p>

            <p eId="para_2217">I am informed by the Garda authorities that in recognising the international dimension to the phenomenon of human trafficking the Garda Síochána is actively participating in a number of anti-human trafficking related initiatives involving law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions.  Liaison at international level between the Garda Síochána and other law enforcement agencies through the exchange of information, intelligence and best practice forms part of the approach of the Garda Síochána to tackling this crime.  A network of members of the Garda Síochána are employed as liaison officers in major cities of a number of EU Member States and in international organisations such as Europol and Interpol to assist in the anti-human trafficking work of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">Gardaí participate in high level meetings organised by Europol, Interpol and Frontex and also inter-act with countries of origin of those suspected of being victims of human trafficking.  The Garda Síochána and officials from my Department are taking a lead role in an anti-human trafficking initiative known as the G6 Human Trafficking Initiative.  This G6 Initiative involves Ireland, the UK, Poland, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands as well as the international organisations, Interpol, Europol and Eurojust.  The most recent meeting of the G6 initiative was hosted by Ireland at Dublin Castle on 15 January 2008.  As part of this Initiative the Garda Síochána has commenced an operation designed to prevent the trafficking of minors into, out of, and within the State.  The operation aims to ensure that the welfare of suspected victims of such criminal activity is adequately provided for, and to commence prosecutions where criminal activity has been detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2219">The signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the United Kingdom Immigration Service and the Garda Síochána facilitates the exchange of data and further enhances the working relationship between the immigration services within the Common Travel Area.  Co-operation is taking place in a number of ways, including intelligence sharing, joint training and operational cooperation where investigations have a cross-border, UK/Ireland dimension.  Operation Pentameter is a proactive and co-ordinated campaign of activity to tackle the trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation throughout the common travel area of the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Operation Pentameter 2 was launched by the UK Home Secretary on 3 October 2007.  The operation is led by Gloucestershire Constabulary.  One of the main objectives of Pentameter 2 is to raise awareness, particularly among those who purchase sexual services, of the scale and nature of the problem of trafficking of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation as a means of reducing demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">A senior officer at Detective Superintendent rank from the Garda Síochána has been appointed as liaison officer with Operation Pentameter and sits as an observer on the Operation's Gold Command Team.  He continues to meet his counterparts in the UK on a regular basis with a view to ensuring that coordination of activity between the two jurisdictions in tackling human trafficking is in place.  Joint operations by the Garda Síochána and UK Immigration Service continue to be part of immigration policy to prevent and detect abuses of the Common Travel Area by human traffickers.  Over 175 personnel, Garda and civilian, are allocated to the Garda National Immigration Bureau and members are deployed in relation to matters arising from Operation Pentameter and other anti-trafficking operations as required.  Personnel attached to bureau have received training in the investigation of human trafficking to an international level.  The Garda Síochána has developed its own human trafficking related training course.  The UK Human Trafficking Centre and the International Organisation for Migration have assisted in the delivery of the training courses.  The training has been delivered to about 150 participants in 2006/2007.  Through the Garda Síochána's involvement in Operation Pentameter a number of officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland have also participated in the training courses provided by the Garda Síochána Training College.  Within this jurisdiction, the Garda National Immigration Bureau continues to liaise with governmental and non-governmental organisations, including Ruhama and the International Organisation for Migration, to ensure the exchange of information regarding suspected trafficking in human beings.</p>

            <p eId="para_2233">The MOU was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office. It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction. Such information is being shared for the purposes of protecting the public from the risks presented by sex offenders and investigating serious sexual offences. The transmission of any information necessary to achieve these purposes is covered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2311">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.  The RIA is currently accommodating almost 7,000 people in 60 centres in 22 counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">In addition to direct provision accommodation, the Agency operates a very limited number of self-catering accommodation centres in certain parts of the country.  This accommodation is reserved for special needs and extreme medical cases in the main.  It is important to understand that in no circumstance  are persons resident within the RIA system entitled as of right to self catering accommodation irrespective of the length of time they are in the asylum system and the special needs involved.  No new self catering centres are planned and the value of retaining the existing centres is under review.  The RIA is satisfied that all of the material needs of asylum seekers can be met within the direct provision system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">I am informed that the person referred to in the question is currently accommodated at Glenvera Accommodation Centre in Cork City.  This person applied for asylum on 20 May, 2003.  The RIA received an application for transfer to self-catering accommodation (as per details supplied with this question by the Deputy) on 29 September, 2007.  This request was given due consideration and was referred to the RIA's Medical Referee for a recommendation.  There was no recommendation to grant and the request for a transfer was refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">In relation to food, the RIA places particular emphasis on meeting, to the greatest extent possible, the dietary needs of residents and, in this regard, 28-day menu cycles are in place in all large centres.  The menus offered reflect the reasonable needs of the different ethnic groups and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated in centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">All contractors are required to serve, breakfast, lunch and dinner each day.  At the centre at which the person referred to above is accommodated, breakfast consists of eggs, a choice of 4 cereals, a choice of 2 juices, a selection of fruit, milk, tea, coffee, toast, brown and white bread and a selection of spreads, jams and preserves.  Lunch consists of a choice of 3 light main course (varied daily) together with vegetables, pasta, rice, potatoes, juice, tea and coffee.  Dinner includes a choice of 2 starters (1 hot and 1 cold) or desert or yogurt and a choice of 3 main courses (varied daily) to include a meat dish, a fish dish and a vegetarian dish.  Tea, coffee, toast, are made available outside of normal meal times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">All contractors are required to consult regularly with residents to ascertain what foods they prefer and how such foods should be cooked.  These meetings are particularly important where many ethnic groups may be accommodated in the same centre and where there are residents who have special dietary requirements.  Menus are kept under review and are revised from time to time with a view to meeting the ethnic and special dietary needs of residents to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">Regular inspections of centres by RIA staff and by an Independent Inspectorate are carried out and appropriate measures are taken where the requirements of residents are not being met.  In addition, RIA staff, including senior management, regularly eat in centres to ensure that the fare on offer is of the standard required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">In relation to the running of centres, residents are provided with a copy of the House Rules and Procedures, which incorporates a complaints procedure.  Management organises regular meeting with residents where issues can be addressed.  Moreover, RIA staff regularly hold ‘clinics' in centres where residents can raise issues in relation, <i>inter alia,</i> the running of the centre, the provision of services at the centre and any problems with quantity, variety or quality of the food.</p>
            <p eId="para_2319">The RIA is committed to facilitating the needs of asylum seekers in direct provision, including their dietary needs.  The person referred to in the question should discuss their requirements with the manager and chef at Glenvera accommodation centre so that they can facilitate her dietary needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2325">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.  I am informed that the person is currently accommodated at Camden Hall accommodation centre in Dublin.  She applied for asylum on 13 February, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">To provide an update on the situation since my Dáil answer last October, this person has made five requests for self-catering accommodation in just over 2 years.  The first three were made on the basis of the length of time she was residing in direct provision accommodation.  Her most recent dated request was received on 12 October, 2007 and was referred to an independent medical referee who was of the opinion that she did not have adequate medical grounds to be considered for self -catering accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2327">It should be noted that no new self-catering centres are planned by the RIA going forward and, moreover, the value of retaining the existing centres is under review.  The RIA is satisfied that all of the material needs of asylum seekers can be met within the direct provision system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2328">Records indicate that the person referred has never complained to centre management about the food or asked for any special dietary concessions.  As her transfer request has as its basis a diet-related medical condition, she was requested on 14 September and 16 October, 2007 to provide centre management with a diet sheet from her doctor.  This has not yet been provided.  When it is provided, centre management will endeavour to facilitate her dietary requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2343">Under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) households pay a contribution towards their rents to the local authority.  The level of contribution is determined by the local authority by reference to each authority's Differential Rent Scheme, and will vary from authority to authority.  Over time this contribution will vary to take into account changes in the income and family circumstances of the household concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">Arrangements regarding the treatment of extra income under the Rent Supplement scheme are a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and I am advised that those in receipt of additional income can discount the first €75 of eligible additional income and 25% of any such income in excess of €75, for rent supplement purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The level of rents payable is determined by negotiations between the landlord and the local authority, taking account of rent supplement levels and local market conditions.  The setting of rent limits under the Social Welfare Allowance scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and his Department is currently reviewing levels of rent limits to determine what limits should apply from July 2008 onwards.  My Department will contribute to the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">A Value for Money and Policy Review is currently underway specifically to evaluate the operation of RAS in light of the objectives set for it and the arrangements under which it operates. The review is expected to be completed in April. Under current arrangements   local authorities have discretion to transfer tenants to RAS who are less than eighteen months on rent supplement, when they are assessed as having a long-term housing need.</p>

            <p eId="para_2833">As regards the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, in the case of a grant application totalling €10,000 or more, applicants are required to produce a valid Tax Clearance Certificate.  As an alternative to producing a valid Tax Clearance Certificate, arrangements are in place whereby an applicant may authorise the relevant local authority to confirm electronically that he/she holds a valid Tax Clearance Certificate by using the on-line verification facility on the Revenue Commissioners' website, www.revenue.ie.  Provision for this authorisation is made on the Housing Aid for Older People application form.</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">In the case of grant applications for less than €10,000, applicants are not required to submit a Tax clearance Certificate but must confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, their tax affairs are in order.</p>

            <p eId="para_2837">The WEEE Directive has been very successfully implemented in Ireland.  During 2006, the first full year of operation, 31,500 tonnes of household WEEE was collected.  This represents approximately 3.5 million electrical and electronic products or 7.4kg per inhabitant.  This is almost double the 4 Kgs target the WEEE Directive requires Ireland to achieve by the end of 2008 and indicates widespread public support for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2838">Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment is solely a producer responsibility.  Two collective compliance schemes, functioning under the responsibility of producers, are operating in Ireland.  These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for the recycling of all household WEEE deposited at designated collection points.  These include civic amenity facilities and retail outlets.  The compliance schemes are also responsible for ensuring that recovered WEEE is recycled in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2839">An increasing proportion of this WEEE is now recycled in Ireland following the establishment of several new WEEE recycling and treatment facilities since August 2005.  My Department is working with relevant stakeholders through the WEEE Monitoring Group to ensure that further progress is made.</p>

Furthermore, the grant level will increase annually in line with the building cost index, thus protecting its value into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2848">The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of attic insulation is primarily the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources.  In addition, where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for upgrading local authority dwellings, the provision of attic insulation may form part of the works undertaken.  From 1 January 2007, direct control was given to local authorities over their internal capital receipts from the sale of local authority dwellings, to be used primarily for their improvement works programmes, including the installation of attic insulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">In July 2004, my Department introduced a separate central heating programme in local authority dwellings.  In conjunction with the provision of central heating, eligible works must also include, where necessary, measures to ensure the energy efficiency of the dwellings such as attic insulation to Building Regulations standards, draught-proofing to existing windows and external doors, the lagging of exposed pipework and hot water storage cylinders, and the installation of a mains operated smoke alarm.</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">My Department does not collate information on the number of local authority dwellings with attic insulation.  However, since the introduction of the central heating programme, some 19,600 dwellings have benefited from the installation of central heating and related energy improvement measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2852">The First Schedule of the Planning and Development Act 2000 specifies, inter alia, that planning authorities may include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding.  Where development is proposed in an area at risk of flooding, it is a matter for each planning authority to evaluate such risk, on the basis of a flood risk assessment where appropriate, and planning permission may either be refused, or, if granted, can be made subject to conditions requiring the implementation of measures necessary to alleviate or avoid damage due to flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were published by my Department in June 2007 to further assist planning authorities in the preparation of development plans.  The guidelines recommend that flood risk should be considered at relevant stages of the planning and development process and the aim should be to ensure that existing flood risks are either reduced or addressed and that new development does not individually or cumulatively give rise to new flood risks, particularly in the context of potential impacts arising from climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">My Department, in conjunction with the OPW, is preparing more comprehensive guidance on flooding and the planning system, which it is intended to issue for public consultation and finalisation this year.  Preparation of these guidelines, and the mapping resources already available to planning authorities on the OPW National Flood Hazard Mapping website at www.floodmap.ie, are two of the key actions arising from the work of the Flood Policy Review Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_2857">European Commission Directive 98/34/EC, which lays down procedures for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations, specifies that Member States are required to notify draft compulsory standards to the European Commission.  Member States are required to wait three months after making a notification under the Directive for the Commission and the other Member States to respond.  If a Member State raises an objection, it is understood that the Commission has to take a position in the matter and the Member State may be required to postpone adoption of the measure for up to 18 months.  However, Commissioner Verheugen, who is responsible for competitiveness and internal market issues related to goods, assured me of the Commission's support for Ireland's intention to introduce the energy efficiency standards from early next year.  He confirmed that, in the light of Ireland's initiative, the Commission would be ready to accelerate its own regulation in this area as much as possible.  We agreed that Ireland would work closely with the Commission to ensure consistency between our approaches.</p>

            <p eId="para_2870">When a water or sewerage scheme is first proposed it may take some time to be approved for inclusion in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme, depending critically on the priority afforded to it by the elected members of the local authority and the resources available for the overall Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2871">In the case of a scheme included in the Water Services Investment Programme, my Department's involvement at individual stages of schemes costing less than €5m is confined to approving the local authority's Design Brief and Preliminary Report, including the Water Pricing Policy Report.  Schemes under €5m represent almost 60% of the 955 schemes in the current Investment Programme.  For traditional style contracts exceeding €5m, my Department also approves the Contract Documents.  In the case of Public Private Partnership contracts my Department, additionally, approves the local authority's Tender Recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">My Department's objective is to deal with Preliminary Reports within six months of receipt.  In the case of Contract Documents the target is four months and two months for Tender Recommendations.  Design Briefs are generally cleared within a few weeks. Issues requiring clarification may arise between my Department and the local authority and could unavoidably extend these timescales.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">Apart from these direct involvements by my Department, responsibility for each scheme, including appointment of consultants, statutory planning and other processes (including public consultation and approval of elected members), site investigations, acquisition of lands and wayleaves, preparation of tender documents, tendering process, appointment of contractors and carrying out of works, rests with the local authority.  The amount of time taken to advance a scheme will depend largely on how quickly these processes are completed.  My Department keeps the approval procedures for water services schemes under ongoing review and is committed to devolving as much responsibility as possible to local authorities, consistent with the requirements of the Department of Finance's Capital Appraisal Guidelines and my own Department's obligations relating to management and oversight of Exchequer expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_2941">ESB owns and operates the pumped water power station with an installed electricity generating capacity of 292 megawatts at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow.  National Surveys for suitable pumped storage sites were carried out many years ago.  Apart from Turlough Hill, the only other economically viable site was at Camlough in Northern Ireland.  However, that site was never commissioned.</p>

Compressed air storage is widely used at small scale within industry, but not generally for power generation at significant scale.  Developments will be kept under close review by my Department in consultation with EirGrid and the energy sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2944">As the Deputy is aware, the primary motivation in aligning the future management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and the introduction of the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of the wild salmon stocks.  It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  We must fulfil our obligations under the Habitats Directive, namely to maintain or restore fish stocks to favourable conservation status.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">Persons who did not avail of the Salmon Hardship Scheme are entitled to apply for a commercial salmon fishing licence where available in the future.  There is no question of relaxing the conservation measures other than where stocks recover and it is established from the results of the Genetic Stock Identification project that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted.  It should be possible, in those circumstances, to exploit the identified surplus in rivers, bays and estuaries by all appropriate methods, within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive.  It is not envisaged that drift netting in the open seas will be licensed in the future.</p>

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.

All non-commercial State Bodies under the aegis of my Department have been requested to carry out an efficiency review in this regard and report back to my Department by 9 February.
