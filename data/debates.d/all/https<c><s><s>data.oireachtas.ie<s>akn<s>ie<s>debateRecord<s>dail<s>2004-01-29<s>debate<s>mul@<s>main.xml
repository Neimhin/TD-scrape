          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 and I call first on Deputy Connolly to state his matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the findings of the task force on the health service that recommended the establishment of a no fault compensation scheme for psychiatric nurses which was agreed by the health service employers agency, the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, and used as an instrument in the settlement of the accident and emergency dispute, the commencement date for such a scheme and the likelihood of the scheme applying across the health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the findings of the task force on the health service which were agreed by the employers in solving the accident and emergency dispute over assaults on psychiatric nurses.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the ongoing and worsening crisis in the health service, where there is not only a shortage of beds but also trolleys on which to place patients and corridor space in which to put them. This cannot be described as a functioning health service. We were promised before the last election that the hospital waiting lists would be cleared within two years. How long will the Government allow this dreadful situation to continue, where patients in Louth county hospital in Dundalk and other hospitals must lie on trolleys for up to five days?</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_5">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the ongoing and serious anti-social behaviour in our towns and cities and the lack of Garda manpower to deal with it, and to give the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform an opportunity to announce to the Dáil the recruitment of the 2,000 gardaí promised in the programme for Government and the appointment of additional community gardaí.</p>

A separate Minister dealt with the last national monuments legislation and since then the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Deputy Cullen, is in flagrant breach of it. Which Minister will introduce this legislation and will it retain or seek to demolish entirely any autonomy that was given to the responsible Minister for national monuments legislation?</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_113">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_114">This Bill is complementary to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 which was signed into law last year. That Act established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to oversee the activities of financial institutions, including their treatment of customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">This Bill provides for establishment of a financial services ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints about financial institutions; establishment of consumer and industry consultative panels to advise the financial services regulator; new reporting and auditing obligations for financial institutions; power for the financial services regulator to impose penalties directly on financial institutions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, subject to a right of appeal to the appeals tribunal already provided for in the Act; a right of appeal to the appeals tribunal as regards certain supervisory decisions of the authority; new regulatory requirementsfor money transmission and <i>bureau de change</i> businesses; and miscellaneous amendments to financial services regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The greater part of the Bill is based on recommendations of the report of the implementation advisory group on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. This document, known as the McDowell report, recommended a new architecture for financial services regulation in this country. The Act passed last year put in place a key component of that architecture, the new financial services regulator. This second piece of legislation provides the remaining pieces of the architecture recommended by the McDowell report. The miscellaneous amendments are mainly technical in nature, correcting flaws and errors in existing financial services legislation that have emerged in the course of practice. They are further pointers to the need for a consolidation of financial services legislation, something that was also recommended by the McDowell group. I am happy to be able to tell the House that a consolidation Bill is now included in the Government's legislative programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The drafting of the Bill has benefited greatly from the public consultation process on its contents. The consultation process has led to significant changes in certain Parts such as that dealing with the financial services ombudsman. I thank the many organisations and individuals who took the trouble to comment on the original draft heads. The end product is a more considered set of legislative proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">I will now comment briefly on the main provisions of the Bill. The financial services ombudsman will deal with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial institutions. Broader issues of consumer protection are the responsibility of the financial services regulator and specifically of its statutory consumer director. The Bill provides for close co-operation with them and the pensions ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">This will allow the financial services ombudsman to bring patterns of complaint to the attention of the financial services regulator so the consumer-director can consider if regulatory action is necessary to deal with the issues highlighted. Codes of conduct issued by the financial services regulator will form one of the important criteria against which the ombudsman will assess complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">There is also provision for close co-operation with the registrar of credit unions within the financial services regulatory authority regarding complaints involving credit unions. Some amendments to the Credit Union Act are also provided for so that members of a credit union will have the same right of access to the ombudsman as customers of other financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">In terms of how the ombudsman will deal with complaints, the intention is that a customer should first make his or her complaint to the financial institution concerned. It is in everyone's interest that financial institutions deal with their customers in a fair way and treat their complaints seriously. If a customer is not satisfied with the response of the financial institution, he or she can refer the complaint to the ombudsman. The ombudsman will try to reach an agreed solution between the customer and the financial institution. If this fails, the ombudsman will make a formal determination on the complaint. The ombudsman's determination will be binding on both parties, subject to their right to appeal to the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Overall, my intention is to provide a simple means for aggrieved consumers to have their complaints dealt with fairly and quickly by an independent person, the ombudsman. The Bill provides that the ombudsman's office will be overseen by a council. I will appoint the members of the council following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The council will consist of up to ten persons and must include people from consumer and industry backgrounds. The council will be responsible for the appointment of the chief ombudsman and deputy ombudsmen. It will also be responsible for laying down the detailed rules governing the scheme, including the levying of charges on financial institutions to fund the operation of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Strong accountability arrangements are built into the Bill. There is a requirement on the ombudsman to produce an annual report and an annual strategy statement, both of which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The chairman of the council and the ombudsman are obliged to appear on request before a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The structure set out in the Bill differs considerably from that originally proposed. This reflects the comments received during the consultation process and subsequent contact with the current ombudsman schemes for the insurance and banking sectors. I am happy to say that the existing ombudsman schemes have agreed, in principle, to amalgamate with and transfer their staff to the new statutory scheme. This should prove a highly advantageous arrangement for all concerned, not least the customer. The statutory scheme will be able to build on the track record and expertise of the existing schemes and their staffs avoiding what would otherwise be a loss of continuity and expertise. Specific provisions are included in the Bill to facilitate the amalgamation. The Bill also provides for investigations commenced under the existing schemes to be continued under the new scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">I now turn to the provisions for the appointment of consumer and industry panels to advise the financial services regulator. The establishment of such panels was recommended in the McDowell report. It is obviously desirable that the financial services regulator pay close attention to the views of those whose interests it is mandated to promote, the consumers of financial services and the providers of those services, financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The Bill has been altered significantly in light of comments made in the course of the public consultation process. I will appoint the panels following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, in the case of the industry panel, the Taoiseach. The financial services regulator will be obliged to consult the panels on all general policy issues. I, as Minister for Finance, am obliged to consult both panels before approving the annual budget of the financial services regulator. Reports and opinions of the panels will be published. The financial services regulator can be obliged to publicly state its reasons if it does not agree with a recommendation from a panel. The regulator is obliged to provide appropriate support to the activities of both panels. Either or both panels can appoint specialist advisory groups on specific issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The consultative panels will provide a very useful reality check for the financial regulator on how its activities are impacting on consumers and financial institutions. Again, the public consultation process has provided the impetus for change in the proposals set out in the Bill which I believe will further enhance the effectiveness of the panels.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">The general recommendations of the review group on auditing have been given legislative expression through the provisions of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act enacted at the end of last year. Apart from establishing the new Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, the Act includes a further important chapter which strengthens corporate governance standards in Irish companies. Of particular importance are the provisions for an annual statement from directors covering the company's compliance with company tax and other laws material to the company's financial position. The compliance statement must be reviewed by a company's auditor who is obliged to give a view on its reasonableness or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The Bill covers the add-ons recommended by the review group on the financial institutions. It provides that the financial services regulator can require financial institutions to provide it or another statutory authority with reports on compliance with obligations under financial services and other legislation. It provides that auditors must make an annual positive statement that they have not come across anything in their examination of a company's finances that would trigger a duty to report to the financial services regulator under various existing statutory provisions. It also gives the regulator the power to require an auditor to provide it with information relevant to its statutory duties. The provisions in this Part of the Bill should be viewed in the context of the Government's determination that we must do all we can to promote the highest standards of corporate compliance in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The McDowell report recommended that the financial services regulator should have the power to directly impose penalties on financial institutions, subject to a right of appeal. Currently, the financial services regulator can only do so through the courts. The Bill provides that the financial services regulator can penalise a financial institution directly if it breaches a requirement of an Act, regulation or code of conduct. The penalty can take the form of a reprimand, a fine, public disclosure or a combination of the three. There is also provision for managers to be disqualified from employment in the financial services sector. The financial institution or manager is given an opportunity to present a case to a sanctions panel and to appeal a proposed penalty to the appeals tribunal already provided for in the Act passed last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The McDowell report also concluded that the appeals tribunal provided a suitable mechanism for review of the financial services regulator's supervisory decisions. I have, therefore, tabled amendments to existing financial services legislation to provide, in general, for a right of appeal to the tribunal rather than the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The system of authorisation which currently applies to bureaux de change is being extended to persons engaged in money transmission business. The main purpose of the authorisation system is to facilitate the effective implementation of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist funding provisions of the Criminal Justice Acts. The current authorisation regime that applies to bureaux de change is also being amended to encompass the objective of preventing the financing of terrorism. The new provisions address international concern at the possible use of such businesses as conduits for the financing of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The Bill includes a wide range of mainly technical amendments to various items of financial services legislation. A small number of these amendments are more substantive in nature, as I will now describe. Some of the amendments to insurance legislation go beyond the purely technical aspects. I refer in particular to the amendments designed to restore the right of an administrator appointed to an insurance company in difficulty to have access to the insurance compensation fund. While we have not had an insurance failure for almost 20 years, it is important to have in place a range of options to deal with such a situation. The amendments restore the option that was availed of by the then Governments when PMPA and ICI got into difficulty in the early 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I also draw attention to the proposed amendment to section 77 of the Central Bank Act 1989 on mergers and acquisitions in the banking sector. The heads of the Bill published last year provided for the removal of the role of the Minister for Finance in this area, as recommended in the banking sector strategic issues report published in August 2000. While I respect the arguments put forward by the distinguished members of that working group, I have decided, with Government approval, that it would be going too far to remove the element of political judgment and accountability that the current arrangement provides. The proposed revision to the 1989 Act sets out the criteria that the Minister for Finance must use when exercising his or her judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">I refer to three proposed amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1995. One amendment provides that I, as Minister for Finance, may extend the provisions of the Act to cover business consumers. This arises from a McDowell report recommendation that non-consumer moneylending should be treated in the same way as consumer lending. I only intend to exercise this power after consultation with the financial services regulator and careful consideration of all the arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Another amendment arising from the McDowell report provides that all institutions that lend on the security of a borrower's principal home be made subject to Part IX of the Consumer Credit Act. Part IX provides protection to a borrower by imposing various obligations on housing loan lenders, for example, to warn the borrower explicitly about the danger of losing the family home if repayment conditions are not met. The third amendment extends the definition of mortgage intermediaries to cover so-called introducers. This amendment is being made on foot of the recommendation from the Director of Consumer Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage, the majority of which will be technical. I will propose more substantive amendments in two areas. One set of amendments will deal with concerns raised by, among others, the European Central Bank regarding the new provisions on sanctions and the appeals tribunal. The second set of substantive amendments will respond to a reasoned opinion from the European Commission about the current exclusion of credit unions from the terms of the consumer credit directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Following the passage of the Bill, we will have put in place the essential building blocks of a modern, consumer focused regulatory system for the financial services sector in Ireland. We will also have contributed significantly to the objective of maintaining Ireland's reputation as a business-friendly, but well regulated domicile for international financial services activity. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_139">I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the performance of the financial services regulator, especially in regard to consumer protection. I was sceptical of the notion of rolling into one the consumer protection and prudential functions and I still have misgivings that, ultimately, in a test of wills, the consumer director will be very much subservient to the financial services regulation dimension of the authority. Nonetheless, the present incumbent in the consumer director role has taken a strong position, is producing worthwhile information for consumers and is confronting the banks in respect of a number of their practices such as the failure to pass on interest rate reductions. She must be commended on the excellence of her work. However, the test will be when issues of enforcement arise and the consumer director requires action to be taken to penalise institutions and whether the significant powers of the regulatory authority will be brought to bear in endorsing and enforcing her role.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I also have misgivings about the IFSRA board, which, with the exception of one excellent appointee, Deirdre Purcell, does not comprise a consumer protection expert. There is no provision in the Act to appoint persons to the board of the authority with a specific consumer protection role. The Director of Consumer Affairs is an <i>ex officio</i> member but he or she is an employee of the board and is compromised in that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">While I have misgivings about the model, significant progress is being made. I read the IFSRA's strategy statement, which was recently published, and I hope to meet representatives of the authority soon to discuss it. It is an impressive document, which outlines seven high level goals and 85 categories of action against most of which the authority has set performance targets. The authority is going about its business effectively and I wish it well.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The balance struck in the legislation is welcome. The appointments of a financial services ombudsman and consumer panels are welcome developments to which I will refer later. The Minister will have read trenchant criticism by Jonathan Westrup, a lecturer in Trinity College, over the past week of the role of the Oireachtas in supervising the financial regulator in particular. He referred to the performance of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in <i>The Irish Times</i> stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_143">It is not hard to conclude that the Irish political system is just not interested in such work because TDs feel that they gain no political advantage from such activity and so there is little political will. The fact remains that the Oireachtas has given regulators great powers but has largely chosen to leave them to their own devices leaving a major gap in the accountability structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">It is important that we should reflect on this issue. It is ironic that, as we propose to establish consumer and industry panels and give them access to substantial resources through the regulatory authority, the same has not been done in respect of the Oireachtas which is seen by many as the primary supervisor in terms of the performance of the regulatory system. Legislation has not often sought to develop that issue in any way. The Minister has provided that in all cases the Oireachtas has the power to call the various bodies before it, which is right and proper, but on the other hand, no legislation has ever sought to specify a schedule of regular scrutiny. Oireachtas committees are, therefore, not under an obligation, for example, to supervise bodies annually. No format of scrutiny is provided or indicated in this legislation and, therefore, for example, routine access to audits that would be the subject of Oireachtas scrutiny is not provided to give the Oireachtas equality of power in an unequal battle to supervise regulators, particularly in as complex an area as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Resources is also an issue for the committee. Mr. Westrup is correct regarding political will because there is little political return from hours of scrutiny of regulators in committee. If the House wants that, an obligation should be put on the committees to do the work and an expectation that they should present the results of this work. That has not been sought in previous legislation nor has it been sought in respect of the authority. The Minister and his advisers need to reflect on the importance of Oireachtas scrutiny of regulators. The important question is who will regulate the regulators? Is it the Minister's role or that of Oireachtas Members? We do not have access to resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Before the legislation was published Mr. Westrup wrote an article in which he compared the resources of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to its counterparts in other jurisdictions. The committee is staffed by one clerk and has access to the Oireachtas legal adviser who is shared with all the other committees. The equivalent UK committee has two clerks, two economists as well as part-time advisers while the New Zealand committee has 2.5 clerks and an audit office which provides reports to the committee, unlike our Comptroller and Auditor General who only provides audit reports to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The issue is not only about giving the committees more resources, as responsibilities must be attached. If we are to go down the road of assigning a serious role to the Oireachtas in overseeing regulators, we must make provision for it. It is instructive that the last time there was a battle when a regulator refused to appear before the Oireachtas, the legislation which had made provision for the regulator had not anticipated such a circumstance and the regulator was able to point out that there was no legal basis upon which the Oireachtas could call her before it. The Minister and his officials give great consideration to the regulation in regard to consumers, industrial users and others but we may need to focus more on the role and responsibilities of the Oireachtas in this area, about which I am interested. It is equally important that the Oireachtas has roles, although the Minister does not support this.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The appointees to the bodies the Minister is seeking to put in place should have some confirmation-type hearings. The Minister has repeatedly said he thinks worthy people would not come forward if they had to appear before Oireachtas committees but that is manifestly untrue. Very worthy people come forward, are proud to have positions on State boards and are happy to be accountable to the Oireachtas in regard to how they conduct their stewardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">I do not see how the Oireachtas would suddenly become perceived as a star chamber if, before they were appointed, people came before a committee and were asked about their intentions and views. That would enhance the role of the Oireachtas and not, as the Minister fears, be seen as a highly politicised attempt to hand-trip someone who happened to have Fianna Fáil connections because he or she was being placed on the board. That would not happen in practice. It might happen on the first day of a nine day wonder as the Oireachtas began to flex its muscles with its new powers, but it would not become a feature of the way in which it oversaw affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">As Deputies and Senators, we have a long way to go in developing our capacity to oversee these regulators who now have extraordinary powers and whose decisions are often surprising — for example, the decision to approve Eircom line rental increases and decisions to repeatedly increase electricity prices, supposedly in the name of competition. Many of these decisions are strange and need Oireachtas supervision. This is a topical issue and is important in the context of our consideration of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">By and large, I am pleased with the Minister's proposals for the financial services ombudsman and it is clearly a welcome appointment. The ombudsman is to be appointed by the council, therefore, striking the right balance in its make-up will be crucial. I understand the Minister envisages a 50:50 split between representatives of industry and consumers. I suspect that a majority of consumer interests on that council would be more appropriate for an ombudsman to protect consumer rights. The point has been made by others outside the House that those appointed should not only be experienced in consumer issues to the extent of, like me, doing weekly shopping, looking at the shelves and knowing what it is to be a consumer, but also have some expertise in the protection of consumers. It is important that dimension is emphasised as opposed to just nominees' general capacity to be a good consumer.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_152">I understand the Deputy's knowledge of consumer pricing structure, now that I know he goes shopping.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_112">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_153">I check out Lidl, Aldi and all the rest of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">It is important we ensure the council which appoints the financial services ombudsman and has the supervisory role has a proper balance and experience and its manner of selection must be appropriate. While not necessarily suggesting the Minister ought to appoint members to the board, perhaps he should allow an open competition in which people can propose themselves. RTE was this morning advertising for people to apply to be on its consumer user panel. Perhaps the process for the financial ombudsman would be more formal than that, but many people would come forward if they thought it was an open competition and if the Minister gave a clear indication he was not merely appointing his own favoured contacts but genuinely wanted a broad-based council with the appropriate skills. If the Minister advertised for people and ran a selection procedure under his supervision and appointed people on a fair-minded basis, it would boost confidence and it would be seen that the Minister was taking a proper approach to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">On Committee Stage we will want to ensure that the independence of the ombudsman from the regulatory authority is clear. The intention is there but the detail must be worked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">It is strange that the ombudsman will not be creating the codes of practice. That is a feature of the appointment of a consumer-director to the regulatory authority. Therefore, it is the consumer director, via the regulatory authority, who will create codes of practice rather than the ombudsman. Perhaps, given the present structure, that is the appropriate way but we must also ensure the ombudsman's experience informs those codes of practice, a point which needs to be copper-fastened in the legislation even though it is provided for to a degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">It is strange that it is proposed to move the existing non-statutory ombudsmen to a sub-role. If there is a working system of oversight, there is a practical argument in favour of using that experience and skill. On the other hand, it is important the Minister provides us with an assessment of the culture and operations of the existing institutions if they are to be transferred <i>en bloc</i> to become the core of the new financial services ombudsman. It is an unusual provision that a new authority such as this would just inherit the work of the non-statutory group. If we go down that road, the Minister needs to demonstrate that the culture and operations of those institutions are up to best practice standard. He must give such assurances that, despite this unusual arrangement, we will still get best practice in terms of the financial services ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">I welcome the binding nature of the determinations to be made by the ombudsman, which is different from the ombudsman director of the public service who does not have such a power but rather has the power to make reports to the Dáil. Perhaps it is instructive that the public sector is willing to give in to the supervision of others' standards of compliance which it would not accept in its own case. Nonetheless, the provision for binding determinations by the financial services ombudsman is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">One anomaly with which the Minister could deal today or on Committee Stage is that it seems a case cannot go to the financial services ombudsman if legal proceedings are ongoing between a consumer and a financial institution. I would like assurances that this will not allow an out for a financial institution which is coming under scrutiny, whereby it can issue legal proceedings and the opportunity for the consumer to use the services of the financial ombudsman is negatived. No one would want to see that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">I congratulate the Minister on not accepting the McDowell proposal that the consumer panels should be chaired by IFSRA staff. That was a strange proposal and I was surprised to see it in the McDowell report. I am glad the Minister has not decided to go down that road and proposes to select the chair from within the panel. I say the same thing with regard to the selection of the members of the consumer panel. The Minister should invite those who wish to be considered and establish a procedure for shortlisting a group of people in whom he has confidence and who he believes will do the job well.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The Minister has struck a correct balance in respect of the powers of the regulatory authority. It can proceed with some regulatory and policy documents without first referring them to the consumer and industry panels but only where there is an obligation to act without delay, and when the documents have been issued the authority is obliged to seek the comments of the panels. That strikes the right balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">It is significant that the Minister has given considerably more powers to the consumer panel than to the industry panel in respect of monitoring and commenting on performance. Only the consumer panel will have the power to make suggestions for initiatives. I presume the Minister feels that to offer an industry panel the power to monitor, comment on performance and make suggestions would risk a conflict of interest. This question can be teased out on Committee Stage. I am sure there are instances where suggestions, initiatives or comments on performance could be permitted to the industry panel rather than statutorily ruling them out. There would have to be tight controls to guard against regulatory capture where the industry panel could gain an unhealthy influence over the activities of the authority. A balance must be struck between the dangers of regulatory capture and denying power to comment on performance or suggest initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The consumer panel will be given substantial power with regard to the IFSRA. Should it not also be given power to comment on the overall performance of the financial sector? It may be that everything can be seen through the prism of the IFSRA but we do not have a particularly competitive financial sector and the IFSRA does not have the power to create competition. It can only regulate what is there although it can make it more congenial for people to enter the market. Perhaps we should consider allowing the consumer panel to make more general comments on the performance of the financial services sector as opposed to the performance of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. We should consider this as we move towards Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I welcome the authority's powers to take more immediate enforcement action than the rather slow process available to it at present. The Bill also transfers the new audit obligations to the financial services sector. I am not an accountant or expert in this field and bow to the professional expertise of the Minister and Deputy Burton. Nevertheless, some of the compliance obligations being imposed on directors in other sectors seem to be excessive. I think of the compliance obligations of a director of a widget factory, for example. However, the new demands being imposed on the financial sector are appropriate. They are intimately bound up with the financial security of consumers who deposit money with financial institutions or who raise money from them. While one may argue that compliance obligations imposed on small operations in the general sphere are too onerous, in the financial sector I am persuaded of their reasonableness. That is also a matter which can be teased out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Had Second Stage of the Bill not been rescheduled at short notice I might have had more to say about it. I welcome the Bill, look forward to the contributions of other Deputies and hope we can further improve on it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_166">I welcome the publication of the Bill and its reading in the House. The appointment of a financial services ombudsman is long overdue and has been promised by the Government for six or seven years. Therefore, the proposal in the Bill to appoint one is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Like most modern economies, the Irish economy is fuelled, to a considerable extent, by credit, especially consumer credit. I note the upbeat Economic and Social Research Institute report on the future performance and prospects of the economy, the importance of the development of the service sector and the impact on the domestic market of the growing population. The consequence of this credit boom is that we live in a world of high pressure advertising by banks and financial institutions which continuously promote their services, instruments and credit to consumers of all ages and classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Many families are now counting the cost of pre-Christmas spending sprees and are waking up to horrendous costs being charged to them by various financial institutions. In a significant number of cases consumers continue to be ripped off by financial institutions and financial service providers. Recent examples, of which we are all aware, include credit cards and store cards with extraordinarily high rates of interest charged on them, despite the fact that interest rates in the eurozone are at a historic low.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Another example is the practice of moneylending companies which operate door-to-door businesses providing credit and a collection service at the door. In a number of clearly indicated cases these companies' interest rates run into several hundred per cent. I draw the Minister's attention to a fine investigation recently carried out by journalists from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> into that phenomenon. Some organisations responded to those reports in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> by saying that, while these credit institutions peddling door-to-door credit charge several hundred per cent interest, illegal moneylenders charge even more. Consumers are between a rock and a hard place.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the IFSRA have been involved in pointing out the difference between the costs of insurance premiums, especially for young male drivers, and the fees associated with the provision of insurance services by brokers and such like. I commend the work started by the IFSRA and the consumer-director based there, which understandably up to now has largely focused on trying to inform consumers about their rights and give them a strong message that shopping around may save them considerable amounts of money. However, it is very early days yet for the IFSRA, which is still very much under the wing and control of the Central Bank. We have yet to see the day when it will bite. While the work it has done so far, particularly on consumer information, is to be commended, judgment has to be deferred until we see a conflict involving financial institutions or financial service providers. The jury is out on whether it is hidebound by the traditional conflict between the guardian role of the Central Bank and the role of an aggressive pro-consumer pro-regulation IFSRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The Bill provides for the appointment of a financial services ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints about financial institutions and for the establishment of two panels, the consultative consumer panel and the consultative industry panel. It is important that consumer interests are strongly represented on both panels and that both panels and the authority are not composed by rounding up and appointing the usual suspects. By that I mean representatives of the various commercial industries and the various organisations in the banking and financial services industries with the usual collection of, in many cases, party political hacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Having established a regulatory framework, while within all parties there are people deserving of public appointment, when setting up a regulatory authority we need people on the panels and authority with experience and who are independent-minded. We need people who can act with a degree of judicial impartiality in carrying out their functions as important roles are given in this Bill, some of which break new constitutional ground to which I will return later.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">It is not sufficient for the Minister simply to consult the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Taoiseach or other members of the Cabinet as he has indicated. We need a clear public procedure covering the appointment of up to 50 persons to the new structures that will apply when this Bill is enacted. There should be a public appointments process, which may entail advertising or a process of consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">It is essential that representatives of organisations such as the Consumers Association of Ireland, which has done much good work over the years, should be on these panels. They have shown a clear expertise and dedication. The Minister should also consider organisations such as credit unions, which have offered not-for-profit credit, particularly to some of the poorest people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I hope the Minister will look at the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which was the victim of probably the most stupid and cruel cut by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. The Minister for Finance pulled the wool over her eyes when he got her to cut back in a mean way the financial arrangements which MABS could put in place for families and individuals who had gone considerably over their heads in becoming indebted to various moneylenders, loan sharks and financial institutions charging extortionate rates of interest. That was a mistake and I hope the Minister will seek to remedy it by consulting widely on the people he chooses for appointment to these various boards and panels.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has taken a detailed interest in the problems of improper use of credit by poor families, should qualify for the Minister's consideration. We know that the financial services industry will offer people by the dozen and while those people will be well qualified for appointment to those panels, they will represent the sector from which they come. While in some cases their appointments will be appropriate, we also want strong independent voices who are champions of consumer interest. It is only in that way that the new authority will get courage to take on malpractice by financial institutions. I am aware that most banks and financial institutions provide decent services to and have good relations with their customers. However there are corner boys whose sole intention is to rip off consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Like many other Deputies I have occasionally dealt with families purchasing a house who find that they are in the grip of a mortgage provider whereby if they hit hard times and fall behind in their payments at any stage they are subject to unbelievable fines. Such areas of doubtful practice need to be clearly addressed by the new authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Section 8 of the Bill deals with administrative sanctions, which can be applied by the regulatory authority where there are transgressions. It provides for fines of up to €5 million, orders to pay costs and, for directors and managers of financial institutions, disqualification from being involved in the management of a financial service provider. These are significant and onerous civil penalties. Has the Minister taken the advice of the Attorney General on the constitutional status of this new mechanism of imposing sanctions? Article 34.1 of the Constitution, one of the cornerstones of the separation of powers, makes it clear that it is for the courts and judges to administer justice and to impose penalties on those who have transgressed the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">While this model comes through the European Union and under European law it is possible to provide such a structure, there are a number of cases where this law comes very close to carrying out the operations of a judicial function in a non-judicial environment. That has happened previously. I refer here to the judgment of Justice Kingsmill Moore in the case re solicitors in 1954 when he clearly stated that judgments can be exercised which are punitive. Fines of £5 million, disqualification from practising a profession or in a particular area of activity are strong and appropriate sanctions where there are transgressions of financial service regulations. I will be interested to hear the Minister indicate in his reply and on Committee Stage whether he is satisfied that these provisions are constitutional.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">There are several examples in the lifetime of the Government where legal advice has been found wanting. Many of these proposals were put forward by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, when he chaired the committee. He subsequently served as Attorney General and is now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Despite possessing one of the most eminent legal brains in this country, his record in second-guessing the courts and producing legislation that is acceptable to them is not brilliant. Has the Minister for Finance consulted the current Attorney General in respect of the constitutionality of section 8?</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I wish to deal with the section that provides for new reporting and auditing obligations for financial institutions. I was not directly concerned with the debate on the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act before it became law. As a fellow accountant, will the Minister for Finance offer a point of view on a specific matter? The Bill provides for the new reporting obligations for financial institutions. Would the Minister be prepared to accept an amendment from the Labour Party to include in the Bill some statutory protection, especially in the case of financial institutions, in respect of internal auditors, independent non-executive directors and the independent audit committee?</p>
          <p eId="para_182">As the Minister is aware, where companies have a listing on the Stock Exchange, as do most large banks and financial institutions, regulatory requirements arise from those bodies and they seek to attend to those functions. However, it emerged from the DIRT inquiry carried out by the House that the role of internal audit systems was critical in alerting the bank to what was happening and in obliging the banks and financial institutions to face up to their responsibilities in terms of their participation in widespread tax evasion in respect of customer accounts. Shareholders in Allied Irish Banks lost significant amounts of money in the scandal involving Allfirst Maryland, one of its subsidiaries. If there had been a stronger internal reporting function, a stronger internal audit committee and stronger independent executive directors operating in that bank, AIB might have been saved the grief and the loss caused by the actions of one of its traders.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Will the Minister, in addition to applying to banks and financial institutions the requirements of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act, give specific consideration to the role of internal auditors in the banks? In my experience as an accountant — I am sure that of the Minister is similar — the continuing internal audit function in banks and financial institutions is the major protection and safeguard against fraud and malfeasance on the part of either staff or directors. Frauds are often perpetrated by the management, owners and directors of a company. We saw this in the cases of Parmalat and Enron where overweening and powerful founding families, directors or owners held sway. It takes a brave individual to threaten any of these entities or imply that their financial stewardship and management is less than perfect. The Bill provides an opportunity to provide further legislative protection in respect of the traditionally strong role played by internal audit systems in banks and financial institutions. The same goes for audit committees and independent non-executive directors.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I attended a function last week at which a report was published by business women regarding the small number of women on the boards of Irish companies. It is interesting that the report was launched by Mr. Buckley from Allied Irish Banks who made an interesting and thoughtful contribution. Women are the main purchasers and consumers in our economy. I salute Deputy Richard Bruton for doing the family shopping. I live in an equal household, so I do some shopping and my husband does the rest. I invite the Minister for Finance to visit the shops from time to time to see what is happening in terms of prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Will the Minister give a commitment that, of the authority and two panels to be established, at least one if not two will be chaired by a woman? There is no reason that the overall composition of the three bodies, of which there will be approximately 50 members, should not be on the basis of a 50-50 split between men and women. As the Minister stated previously, there are more than enough qualified women available and interested in doing those jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I wish to take up a point made by Deputy Richard Bruton in respect of the panels which will have an important regulatory function. I would like the members of the panels to be recruited through an open process. I accept that the Minister will have the final call on who will be appointed. However, the members of the panels and the regulatory authority should be obliged to make statements of their financial interests similar to those made by Members of the Oireachtas and local authority representatives in order that, especially in the case of people who come from the financial services industry, it can be clearly seen whether there might be potential conflicts of interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The job of the panels will be important. Deputy Richard Bruton correctly referred to the ridiculous level of resources available to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Mr. Jonathan Westrup, in his lecture to the ACCA, remarked that the capacity of the Oireachtas committees to oversee regulators is limited and that there is not a high level of interest among Members in this regard. In my experience there is a high level of interest and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which has a mixture of economists, accountants, former bankers and people with significant experience in business and other walks of life among its members, is an example of this. The members of the committee are well qualified for the job expected of them. However, the committee is entirely without resources to carry out the job of overseeing regulatory agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">What resources will the Minister allocate to the panels so they can properly carry out their functions? If their members will simply get a monthly lunch in the Central Bank headquarters at which, just before lunch is served, they will be given a three page statement outlining what is being done, that is not regulation. The panels should be empowered to bring to the attention of the regulator, for example, the fact that people are paying 300% interest rates to loan sharks and to ask what will be done to prevent consumers being ripped off. We want regulatory panels with teeth in terms of the power to raise issues as they affect consumers, big and small, in the operation of financial services and industries. One issue I invite them to address is how mortgage lenders act when people get into difficulty with their mortgage repayments. Some mortgage providers charge extortionate fines when mortgage payers fail to keep to the schedule of their agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">There is a great deal of work to be done in detailing and building up a picture for the Oireachtas of how the new structure will work. The new structure is welcome. In principle, much of its operation should go well, although I have grave doubts about the constitutionality of section 8. I welcome the establishment of the panels provided they are independent, appointment is on merit, there is an appropriate gender balance and they do not simply become the province of party political or industry hacks. That is important. The people on the panels must be independent. If we achieve that and if the panels are properly resourced to target those areas that are regularly identified as areas in which consumers and small business may be abused, we will create a financial services regulatory authority ombudsman that will have real teeth.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Following representations from the Director of Consumer Affairs, there is an attempt in the miscellaneous sections of the Bill to regulate the practices of mortgage intermediaries. These are people who find mortgages for clients. In my constituency, and probably in the Minister's, there are many people who provide mortgage intermediary services. Some of them are providing those services as a consequence of leaving banks and building societies. They are providing a good service. Others, however, are charging high fees and I welcome the proposal to regulate the way fees for such services are provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I am concerned that some of these mortgage intermediaries are too close to the big builders who are building the estates. It is a closed circle and the young couples buying houses, being so anxious to get into the property market and to get a mortgage, end up with insufficient knowledge of how much they will actually pay in terms of the capital cost, which they are borrowing, and the service charges that surround obtaining the eagerly sought mortgage. I welcome that provision in the Bill but perhaps the Minister will explain in further detail how it is proposed to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The consumer-director has also been at pains in recent months to give more information about certain financial services products, in particular, products such as tracker bonds. Many people have little financial expertise. The general rule is <i>caveat emptor</i> and, ultimately, consumers must take responsibility for their actions. Nonetheless, there are financial service products available, such as tracker bonds, which are new and are strongly marketed as almost guaranteeing financial returns. Consumers do not have the capacity to read the small print and significant numbers of people have sustained significant losses from these products as a result of the fluctuating stock markets in the past couple of years. The IFSRA is empowered to give information to consumers about the pros and cons of different types of financial products. I hope that when the panels are established they will go a step further and examine and inquire into some of these products.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_193">I propose to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Connolly and Boyle.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">This Bill is a follow-up to the 2003 Act of the same name. At its core is the establishment of a financial services ombudsman. This is a long overdue development and is badly needed by users of financial services, particularly the ordinary customers of banks and insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The issues dealt with in the Bill were debated in the course of the passage of the 2003 Act. This was followed last summer by a series of hearings conducted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I commend my colleagues on the committee on their participation in those hearings, which examined the charging practices of the main banks. The committee also heard from the consumer-director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority established under the 2003 Act. The hearings confirmed the need for greater consumer protection and, particularly, the establishment of a financial services ombudsman, which is provided for in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Irish people, as individual consumers and as a society, are being grossly exploited by banks and other financial institutions. I instanced my experience and observation of that at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and in the House when we discussed the original substantive legislation. Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland operate a virtual duopoly. They and the other main financial institutions are raking off excessive profits in their dealings with customers through charges and a range of practices which ensure their dominance in the market. This has a major knock-on effect on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">The reality customers must deal with is shown in the figures. I will offer just one statistic at this point. In 2002, there was inflation of 23% in this State for financial services, which includes both the insurance sector and the banks. Compare that with an EU average of only 4% over the comparable period. These are the figures presented by Forfás in its consumer pricing report for 2003. That is a damning comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">We should study the survey conducted in 2001 by ISME, the Irish small and medium enterprise representative body. Among the points gleaned by the survey was that one fifth of customers surveyed bluntly stated that they did not trust their bank. Half the respondents outlined that they were concerned about interest rate charges. Three quarters of those reported that they were concerned about bank fees and charges. Almost half the firms which queried their bank charges and interest rates and which initially received an unsatisfactory response received a refund. What does this tell us? Eight out of every ten ISME members surveyed queried their bank about charges and interest rates, but fewer than two thirds of them received a satisfactory response. When the issue was pressed, nearly half received a refund.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Almost two thirds of respondents stated that their bank charges were not fully explained, while 41% indicated that new charges had been applied in the previous 24 months. What was worse was that almost half the respondents indicated that their bank had debited their account without prior permission or approval. More than 60% indicated that they had been unable to negotiate lower interest rates or bank charges. Unsurprisingly, three quarters of respondents stated that there was no difference between the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The Minister must bear in mind that the customers surveyed were business people directly represented by ISME. Most of them would be able and confident to challenge their banks with the support of a representative body which is flexing itself in the market. Other customers with less clout, such as families on lower incomes and older people, would be more open to abuse from the financial institutions than the sector of which I have given an account.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Irish Bankers Federation has publicly opposed the Government's banking levy, which was introduced last year. I have spoken about that a number of times during budget debates with the Minister. That levy is only €300 million over three years and it is spread across all the banks. That is only a fraction of what banks should contribute. They are among some of the largest beneficiaries of the Government's decision to slash corporation tax from 16% to 12.5%. The practical result of banks' predominant position and the Government's failure to challenge them is less revenue, resulting in less money for the health services, the repair and building of schools, people with disabilities and badly needed social housing programmes. The untaxed portion of these massive profits enriches a privileged minority in society while our infrastructure continues to suffer and the marginalised not only stay on the margins but, as we have seen in successive budgets, are confined to that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">What emerged from the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service was that we have all the problems of exploitation by financial institutions but none of the principal solutions. We do not have Government or EU control of charges because it is laid down on tablets of stone that it would be anti-competitive. I have been arrogantly informed time and again when I raise the issue that the question of having such controls is invalid. Despite this, we do not have real competition, as has been demonstrated in the financial services sector. I am not prepared to accept any claim to the contrary. That was clearly revealed during the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">We also considered the extraordinary situation where Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and the Trustee Savings Bank operated a cartel in the tendering process initiated by Cork County Council. The latter two banks withdrew from the tendering process, resulting in its collapse. That forced the county council to accept the terms of its then banker, Allied Irish Banks. That dictated the terms for the council because it was not left with any option as no one else was bidding for its business. It went from a position of having an 80% discount on the gross commercial scale of fees payable on all accounts to what will be 10% in 2006. What will be the net effect on the people of County Cork? It will mean a further €187,000 in bank charges which will come from people's contributions to the public funds of the local authority and which should be better spent on other much needed measures in County Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">As a submission from the Consumers Association of Ireland stated: "The immediate asset test for IFSRA will be how swiftly it redresses the balance of power between Irish retail banks and Irish customers". The results of that test remain to be seen and have yet to be assessed. The same test will apply to the financial services ombudsman as established by the Bill which, as I have already recorded, I welcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_205">I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I welcome the debate on banking and the financial services. However, we have been too silent on the question of integrity and honesty in the banking and business sectors. I have felt for many years that the big boys and girls involved in the different business and banking scams have got away lightly. I strongly welcome the establishment of a financial services ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints about financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">In recent years Ireland has become known as the island of scandals and tribunals. Politics, banking, business, the church, the legal profession and the medical profession have suffered from the erosion of public confidence. That has had a profound impact on our value system. The Bill must be part of the analysis and the serious debate we need in society. These financial scandals have led to a lack of participation in the democratic process. We must wake up to that reality. We in politics call it the "you are all the same" syndrome. Approximately 33% of voters seem to label all politicians as the same and to blame them for the scandals, especially the financial scandals. Our friends in the media also contribute to that on a daily basis with ill-informed commentary and deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. Many of the electorate believe we live in a liberal democracy. I urge them to think again and open their eyes to the scandals in financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">When discussing the Bill, it is essential to consider the Minister's earlier remarks about maintaining Ireland's reputation as a business friendly but well regulated country. Those of us on the left of politics — there are not many of us left — are often labelled as being against business and profits. I have no major ethical problems with profits, only with their misuse. Not all profit is greed. When it is used in a positive and constructive way to the greater good of society, I strongly encourage profit-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Some matters should be clarified in this debate on financial institutions. Pope John Paul II in the encyclical, <i>Centesimus Annus</i>, published in May 1991, presented a moral evaluation of capitalism:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_209">Can it perhaps be said that, after the failure of communism, capitalism is the victorious social system, and that capitalism should be the goal of the countries now making efforts to rebuild their economy and society?</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The answer is complex. Those of us who believe in social justice should tell people straight out that the solution lies in a left of centre mixed economy with a strong public service engine room. The economic policies of right wing philosophers may be rampant in the international arena but they are leading to more poverty, disadvantage, exclusion, injustice and a more violent international community. That is the world of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">This is relevant to the Bill which gives us an opportunity to set out a direction for our country and, above all, for justice and ethics in our financial services. It provides for the establishment of a financial services ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints about financial institutions, which I strongly support. It also provides for the establishment of a consumer and industries consultative panel to advise the financial services regulator and empowers that regulator to impose penalties on financial institutions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, subject to the right of appeal to the appeals tribunal already provided in the Central Bank Act. These are positive aspects of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I am a strong supporter of consumers' rights. The consumer is being hammered and, if the Minister of State does not do something practical about prices, and the way people are overcharged, there is no point in passing this Bill or having this debate. I hope the Minister of State and the Cabinet will listen to a different view and take it on board so that we can move forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which represents a charter for the protection of the consumer against malpractice by unscrupulous financial institutions. These institutions cannot afford to take their customers for granted as ACC Bank, now owned by Rabobank and formerly known as the farmers' bank, has done. This institution now restricts lodgements and withdrawals to a minimum of €1,000, greatly increasing the vulnerability of rural dwellers to the possibility of violent attacks and home robberies. In effect, it makes them sitting ducks for this type of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I seriously query the ethics of this restrictive practice which forces many elderly people to save up to €1,000 at home thereby placing them at considerable risk to life and limb. Some years ago outbreaks of home robberies and violent attacks on elderly people galvanised the banking sector into presenting attractive terms to rural dwellers and encouraging them to place their savings in banks and other financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">ACC Bank-Rabobank obviously believes it can dispense with the small customer for whom this deterioration in services will pose a major security risk. It will hardly escape the notice of criminals that every customer who enters or leaves branches of this bank will be carrying at least €1,000. For the criminal it would be a matter of establishing whether the hen is going to lay or whether it has just laid. This irresponsible action effectively changes the bank's status to that of an industrial and business bank rather than a service for small customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">It also establishes a dangerous precedent for other financial institutions and the associated banks. First Active has already announced its intention to be the first cashless bank in the country. This is another attack on the rights of small customers who may be uncomfortable with technological advances and have always relied on the banks to handle their cheques. These financial services providers are moving to edge out the small depositors and reduce the consumer's right to freedom of choice. They also make it difficult for their local managers to maintain their bread and butter customers in local and farming communities to attain their monthly and yearly targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">New regulatory proposals will be a deterrent to the widespread disparity between the charges imposed by the money transmission agencies. These disparities are difficult to justify and one wonders why they were permitted hitherto. The regulatory requirements will also help to root out the gangster element from the industry and make money transfers more affordable for student travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">One recalls the many exchange bureaux that sprang up in the vicinity of the Border, particularly on the Dundalk to Newry road and the Tyholland-Middletown area of the Border just half a mile from my home. They were located in tin huts and cabins just short of the Border, mainly on the southern side, and did not seem to be regulated. They did not do anything to engender customer confidence in financial service providers and institutions. This confidence has taken a battering in recent times as a result of faulty investment advice. One recalls the great fanfare which greeted the launch of the Eircom shares debacle when pensioners lost heavily as a result of misplaced optimism and faulty advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">With the impending enlargement of the European Union on 1 May by the entry of ten new states and the free movement of capital throughout the enlarged 25 member EU, the Bill's stated aim of preventing money laundering is laudable. Any measure to reduce the amount of dirty money concealed behind apparently respectable businesses is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I also welcome the Bill's provision to bring introducers in the area of mortgage sales within the scope of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 thereby regulating their activities. Prior to this many of the middle layer operators in this area were little more than chancers or cowboys who did nothing more than increase the cost of the mortgage service to the client with little if any value added as a result. The Act is also being enhanced by the Bill which obliges lenders of housing loans to make consumers aware of various factors and responsibilities regarding their borrowing. One omission is the introduction of a cooling-off period. This should perhaps be two or three weeks to allow potential borrowers to reconsider whether to proceed with the loan. I welcome the proposed function of the financial services ombudsman in dealing with consumer complaints against banks, credit unions, insurance companies and brokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Last year in Britain, complaints about financial products and services increased by 44%, underlining increasing levels of dissatisfaction with pensions, endowments, stock markets and investments. Most of the complaints concerned mortgage endowments which were oversold by brokers in the same way that banking services are oversold to college students. I hope that the financial services ombudsman will be able to outlaw irresponsible and abusive promotions by banks to cajole and encourage college students to borrow for trivial reasons.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_222">The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 was the first new Bill discussed in the 29th Dáil and the first on which I had the opportunity to speak. At that time the Opposition expressed several concerns which repeated the view of many consumer rights groups that, as the first building block for a consumer protection infrastructure for the financial services sector, the Bill was putting the cart before the horse. Its philosophical premise seemed to lay too great an emphasis on the prudential role and not enough on the consumer protection role. In many ways those criticisms remain valid but they have been outweighed and ameliorated somewhat by the strong performance of the Director of Consumer Affairs, as previous speakers, and consumer rights groups have noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">In putting the final pieces of this jigsaw together and, I hope, establishing the type of consumer protection infrastructure which has been long sought and needed, there is an onus on us in this House to get it right. While much of what is contained in the Bill goes in that direction, we still need to ask questions to ensure the necessary fine-tuning and nuancing take place. It remains the case that the overall board of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority is too highly weighed in terms of traditional financial institution and banking types and should have a greater consumer involvement role, as is the case in the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, albeit a different model. If the intention is to bring about an infrastructure in which consumers can have a great deal of faith, this is something we should have sought to change in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The idea of establishing new panels, in particular a consumer panel, is to be welcomed. However, it is a step removed from actual board involvement. It is trying to influence the policy direction of the IFSRA from a remove, with no guarantee that influence will eventually pay off. There is also the difficulty that consumer involvement in such a panel is not properly defined or guaranteed by those who have been campaigning in the area such as the Consumers Association of Ireland. It would help the Bill if we were to name the type of consumer groupings which should be involved on both the panel and, ultimately, on the board of the IFSRA. This model is used in the United Kingdom and I see no reason it should not be repeated here.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Deputy Bruton referred to the difficulties of public appointments. The Department of Finance is currently progressing through the Houses the Public Services Recruitment and Appointments Bill, which specifically precludes Government appointments. I would welcome a process whereby nominations would be sought for positions such as this where people would need to justify publicly the role they can play in organisations from a consumer protection viewpoint. It would be welcome if the Bill could be improved in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Both the Central Bank and financial services authority Bills are based on the McDowell report, to which there have been several references. It is in the remit of the Minister and the Government to pick and choose from such a report if they feel subsequent legislation will be better as a result. The curious thing is the selective way in which the Department and the Minister have approached the McDowell report. The argument about having a standalone authority is now over. It is enmeshed within the Central Bank. It is operating successfully to a certain extent. This is a key recommendation of the McDowell report which was ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Another recommendation the Minister is choosing to ignore in this regard is the separation of consumer credit and business credit. This is a mistake, particularly in regard to small businesses where there is a strong interlinkage. I can cite one case without naming the individuals involved. A woman who came into my constituency office lost a florist business because of involvement with a financial institution based on family security. If the IFSRA and the ombudsman are to be successful, and if the consumer director is to have even greater strength, the organisation must be able to tackle situations whereby credit is given too easily. There is far too much credit in our society. When the credit exists, the linkages between security, which is subsequently sold at a greater value than is still owing to the financial institution, and where a financial institution such as the Irish Nationwide Building Society has the ability to charge late payment facilities, and the legislative need to put in place measures whereby the length of time in which foreclosures can be made, should be strengthened so that people can work their way on a business level out of the difficulties in which they find themselves. We should not make a direct breakage between consumer credit and non-consumer credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">It appears a contradiction that the Minister will not accept the recommendations in the McDowell report in regard to political involvement in bank mergers and acquisitions. I agree with him on this point. It is important in the future to seek to have some semblance of control over how many actors can be involved in the financial services sector so we do not have to go to one big bank, and we do not have a situation where all the financial institutions are owned outside of the State, as is the case in New Zealand, which is a similar type economy and has a similar population. There are lessons to be learned from the experiences of other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Most of the credit implications of financial institutions foreclosing unnecessarily and dangerously on individuals result from the role of property in this country and the economic value placed on it. I do not think it is a coincidence that the house price bubble here occurred since the direct entry into the mortgage market of the major financial institutions and banks. Deputy Bruton already alluded to the vested interest that developers, builders and construction companies might have with financial institutions. There are other vested interests, for example, the legal profession. This is why thousands of people are unable to get proper legal redress through the legal system. The legal profession is slow to take on people with whom it has an ongoing business relationship in terms of the acquisition of property and conveyancing. This is why the role of a financial ombudsman and a strong consumer director within the financial services authority is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">On the basis that several building blocks are left unplaced on the edifice that should be a strong financial services authority, and that these are the blocks that should have been in place in the first instance, I am prepared strongly to support the Bill. I hope the Government will accept several amendments tabled not just by Opposition spokespersons but by consumer rights organisations who still have reservations as to how this can be the most effective organisation possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_231">I did not expect to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill today but I am now pleased to do so. I wish to make a number of points which I hope the Minister of State will take note of.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">As we have already heard from our party spokesperson on finance, Deputy Bruton, Fine Gael welcomes the legislation and supports the vast majority of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003. It is complementary to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003. The Act established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to oversee the activities of financial institutions, including their treatment of consumers. There are three main purposes to the Bill on which I wish to comment. The first is the establishment of the financial services ombudsman, which is the main purpose of the Bill, dealing with consumer complaints about financial institutions. The second is the establishment of a consumer and industry consultative panel to advise the regulatory authority. The third is to introduce new reporting and auditing obligations for financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Before referring to the content of the Bill, I want to put in context why Fine Gael is so supportive of it. In recent months, Fine Gael has adopted an advocacy role on behalf of consumers. We believed it was necessary to do so because it was an area the Government was neglecting. Under our party spokesperson, Deputy Hogan, we launched an insurance campaign which I hope has made some contribution towards ensuring the people in power take action on trying to reduce insurance costs across the board, whether business or car insurance. The other initiative has been the creation of a website, <i>www.ripoff.ie</i>, which has had many hundreds of complaints since it was established. A number of the complaints deal with banks and financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I wish to give a flavour of some of the concerns that were raised, which I hope will be dealt with by the ombudsman's office. The first concerns the cost incurred by customers when switching banks. What needs to be achieved is a seamless system in which the customer is king and in which he or she can switch from one bank to another without bearing a cost or inconvenience when doing so. If we are serious about insisting on competition and choice for the consumer in respect of banking, mortgages and other financial services, we need to ensure this is the case. Such a system is not in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Concerns arise over stamp duty when switching mortgages. I hope an ombudsman's office will be able to deal with this. In the case of credit cards, the Government, through the introduction of its new levy on credit cards in a recent budget, has added to the complexity of switching between financial institutions, depending on the time of year one switches. Another issue, which continues to be topical, although some improvement has been made in this area in recent years, is the cost of using a credit card in Ireland compared with other countries, the United States being an obvious example. The level of competition in the provision of credit card services in Ireland is not sufficient. We are paying interest rates of between 3% and 4% for the use of a credit card service, yet financial institutions are charging three or four times that rate. The consumer is not getting value for money when using credit cards in some cases. The ombudsman's office could address this and the consumer panel could make suggestions on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The most blatant of the issues with which an ombudsman's office may need to deal is that of passing on interest rate cuts by the ECB to the customer after such cuts are introduced. In this regard, consider a press release by Deputy Richard Bruton from some months ago, which sums up this issue very well. He stated that while the large banks have passed on the interest rate cut to mortgage customers, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority must examine the position regarding business and personal customers. The press release states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_237">Mortgage lending, makes up, less than one-third of all Irish lending. The rest is made up of short and long term borrowings. In the years since December 2000, the ECB rate has come down by 2.75%. In that time the business borrowing rates have only come down by half of this amount. Personal borrowers are in the same boat although those with term loans did somewhat better. Clearly the banks have not been passing on savings to borrowers in these categories, who between them have borrowings of €95 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">We have had some complaints similar to that in the press release, which in turn are similar to those found on the website <i>www.ripoff.ie</i>. The problem needs to be addressed. Perhaps the figures in the press release are slightly out of date. However, they make the point that, on foot of interest rate cuts made by the ECB over a period of two and a half years, parallel cuts have been made by the financial institutions in the area of borrowing with the highest profile, namely, mortgages. However, we have not seen the same cuts in the other areas of borrowing people may not be monitoring so carefully, namely, business loans and short-term borrowing for car loans, etc. This can and, I hope, will be addressed by the ombudsman's office and the advisory panels, which will have an advisory role.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Fine Gael welcomes the concept of the ombudsman. In some cases, consumers feel quite powerless when dealing with their banks. Until recent years, the bank manager has been very much a dominant figure in society and he or she often dominated the agenda rather than the customer. This needs to change and it has already begun to change in many ways. New financial institutions, such as the Bank of Scotland, have come to Ireland and provided more competition. However, there are still consumers who feel somewhat powerless in their dealings with banks. To offer them a channel of complaint is important, and this is certainly what the ombudsman's office will provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">It is important that the body itself is constructed carefully and that it is user-friendly and easy to access. The Minister should ensure there is an adequate PR campaign to promote the idea of the ombudsman so the public will be aware of it. It is often those who need such a facility most who need to hear about it through a PR campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The consumer director of the IFSRA is doing a reasonably good job and this needs to be acknowledged. She has undertaken a number of surveys, raised issues and generated debate. An obvious example pertains to the insurance sector, where she conducted a survey of insurance costs that has helped inform us on the insurance debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Let us consider the level of indebtedness in which many now find themselves. The Government could perhaps take some initiatives in this area. The reality is that very few young workers do not have a mortgage, car loan, holiday loan, student loan, high overdraft facility or high credit card limit. Some may have all of these. Given that interest rates are so low, there is a move towards making it too easy for people to borrow money. If there is even a slight change in interest rates, borrowers in this category may find themselves under very significant financial pressure. Five or ten years ago, it was very difficult to get a loan of up to €7,000 or €10,000, yet such loans now seem to be offered without asking by way of an overdraft limit. We need to examine whether our financial institutions are encouraging people to borrow in a way that could be dangerous to the consumer interest should interest rates change or should the economic climate change in terms of employment and earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I welcome the advisory panel on consumer interests. Its role will be to monitor the performance of the IFSRA and provide suggestions for initiatives that could be taken by either the Government or the regulatory authority itself. It is a positive suggestion and I regard it as a type of think-tank panel, which will be helpful. For example, it could undertake studies on behalf of the consumer when it feels there may be issues of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The panel will only be as good as the people who are on it. I do not want to see the type of political appointment system we have had in the past for prison visiting committees. This should not be used to reward local Fianna Fáil cumann or Progressive Democrats branch members.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">Those involved should be advocates of the consumer interest and have a proven track record in the area. We must be responsible if we are serious about a panel that can make a difference to the consumer. We should appoint the right people, regardless of their political background.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The establishment of an industrial consultative panel is welcome and necessary. We must achieve good regulation and protect the consumer while ensuring that Ireland remains a competitive place to do business. However, we must not frighten off financial institutions or businesses that deal with them through overregulation. The Minister of State is not a fan of overregulation, — he is the opposite — but we must be careful. We need a free, open economy where people can borrow money and there is competition in the area. At the same time, we must have regulations in place and an advisory panel to protect the consumer and ensure that everyone is treated in a fair manner. This will build an open, transparent and competitive market in Ireland. The industry consultative panel will play a vital role in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">We must ensure the advisory panel advises and does not make decisions. It must not have the capacity to make decisions because people will come from industry into the area with a good understanding of it but their role must be strictly advisory.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The Bill introduces the new reporting and auditing obligations recommended by the review group on auditing following the Committee of Public Accounts investigation into DIRT irregularities chaired by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell. Is the requirement in the Bill for the provision of a compliance statement each year by directors the same as the requirement under the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill? There is a concern that the Bills do not complement each other and we should avoid duplication.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Bill is welcome and will improve the situation for the consumer. It will empower consumers who currently feel that banks are overly-dominant and will promote more competition between financial institutions, helping people to move from one institution to another. It creates two advisory panels that will assist in financial regulation in future both for the consumer and industry.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_251">Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin reachtaíocht tábhachtach seo. D'fháiltigh mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Burton, roimh an reachtaíocht cheana agus dúirt sí go raibh sé thar am go dtiocfadh sé isteach. Tá Páirtí an Lucht Oibre sásta gur comhlíonadh an gealltanas a bhí tugtha ag an Rialtas, is cuma b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé beagáinín déanach.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">There is an obligation that this Bill satisfies the fundamental social requirement to restructure the relationship between clients and the banking sector. I have my own view on the commercial banking sector. Its relationship with the public has been outrageous. What has happened to the average customer within that sector? There has been a destruction of services in the name of modernisation and the service provided to the customer has been fundamentally changed. I came to Galway in 1960 when banking was not an occupation that was used to impress in night-clubs in Dublin. I remember the bank manager in Galway as a remote figure in the downstairs office in Lynch's Castle who pretentiously read the pink pages of the <i>Financial Times</i> to impress the rest of the staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I would, however, go back to the era of the pink pages rather than continue the current system. Between then and now there has been a systematic destruction of the skill level of those who provide the service from a trade union point of view and there is a reliance on cheaper labour. Banks suggest that customers have their dockets filled in before approaching the counter and the corralling started by Disneyland in the United States decades ago has crept into the banking halls, with people dividing themselves between lines so the least possible amount of time is spent between the provider of the financial service and the person who is using it. This is all presented as modernisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The Minister mentioned an issue closer to the core of the Bill — the outrageous advertising of financial services. There is a long list that begins in the recent scandalous period with endowment mortgages and goes on to the notion of equity-based tracker bonds. The latter are sold to customers on the basis that the financial services adviser who occasionally drops into the bank, but who is usually not on the premises, is available. A question to a person behind the counter results in the customer being given a telephone number which relays the message that the investment adviser is Liz and she can be called on Thursday mornings between 11 a.m. and 12 noon and, even then, she might not be there. This is an outrageous approach towards the public, but the public puts up with it. For many, myself included, this deterioration in relationship represents something appalling about what is presented as modernisation and as preparation for a new globalised existence about which I need not waste my time. One can publish as many 100 page documents as one likes but one does not need to be a rocket scientist to see the margins that exist between the services of Irish banks and those of other banks in Europe and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">In 2004 in this economy, the second richest in Europe and the fourth richest in the world, with the least social protection, it is now impossible to transfer money from one bank to another. That is an extraordinary development. I go from here occasionally, as many Deputies do, to a bank at the corner of a well-known street. If I wish to transfer money to a member of my family who happens to be using another bank, I must take it out in cash, walk across the street and lodge it in the other bank. I am told that one cannot make an interbank transfer.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I find all this interesting as a sociologist. It is as if the only troublesome aspect of the Irish banking sector is the people. One must reduce the number of staff and have lower-skilled staff placed in worse conditions. I remember the late Mr. Titterington who at least retained some sense of standard in the banking sector. The notion is that it is only tedious cranks who do not use the new system. Let me make a perfunctory observation at this point that is fundamental. To say one is making changes, from the Office of the Ombudsman down, and not to put someone who is consuming the services into a strong position on the main board and on the necessary panels will create a very serious deficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">On the other side there is what one might call false and artificial advertising. If tested some of it is already unlawful under existing legislation. For example, to advertise on television or radio that one could reduce one's monthly bill by such an amount without specifying what debt one would be accumulating over the new period of the loan is frankly fraud, yet it happens every day. The attitude that has been adopted is that one can say anything to maximise one's commercial return, irrespective of the ethical base.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I lectured in financial economics more than 30 years ago. We read about the relationship of the Central Bank to the commercial banks. People do not realise it but in 1947 the distinguished T. K. Whitaker was running between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank because the Central Bank had told the Government it could not continue to operate as it was doing. There was an effective strike by the Central Bank against the Government. At that time, if people look at the history of the bank and the Department of Finance, the issue was resolved by a set of accommodating letters, a change of Government in 1948 and then, much later, a change in economic policy leading eventually to the point which is now prominent, 1958-63 and the First Programme for Economic Expansion. My point is that the bank's reputation as a source of orthodoxy was very much vaunted at the time. In more recent times there is no doubt, as the banks' representatives appeared before the committees of this House on the question of vigilance in the operation of accounts outside this State and operation of DIRT and so on, that there was a serious lack of even the most minimal diligence that one might have expected in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">To go back to where I began, this legislation which was promised is welcome, even if late in delivery. The Labour Party spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Burton, has also welcomed it but she has emphasised that consumers are still being ripped off and the necessity for a strong consumer presence in the different bodies that will come into being. I will turn to that in a moment because there are some other questions which she raised on which I would like to elaborate.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I want first to tease out what I am saying. In public policy the issue of ethics is very important. Let me observe <i>en passant</i> that much damage has been done to civil society internationally by the recent events in the United States, from which the international commercial world is reeling. What I am talking about is fraud. There is an assumption that when the figures get a few zeros added it becomes miscalculation rather than fraud or an off-balance sheet mistake, but it was misrepresentation and fraud. The ethical basis of banking and of credit and its relationships will be strengthened by the existence of some of these new institutions. However, they must come from outside the traditional banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">There is more to being responsible in banking and financial services than going away for corporate weekends and looking pink from gin and tonics and port. The reality is that many of the people who have described themselves to me as bankers are a joke. They may have some expertise that they picked up in some part of the economy, but the assumption is that after one has passed some kind of consumption or wealth threshold one is qualified for the board of a bank. They have done very badly for us and very well for themselves. I would love someone to write a short essay some time, which they might make available to all of us lay members of the public, on what precisely are the valuable functions exercised by executive and non-executive directors of banks. Are the decisions so complex and so intricate that they need regular renewal, rather like the barrister who is well paid for a case and who needs a refresher to brighten his mind again and remember the contours of the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Our non-executive directors need to be refreshed endlessly, with buckets of money, not drops. That kind of ancient structure is daft and irresponsible and I do not respect it. At the same time these people, who vote huge sums of money for themselves using the shareholders as cover, provide a miserable, narrowing and shrinking service for the members of the public. I remember writing about it and the banks getting very excited 20 years ago, maybe less, when I was writing for <i>Hot Press</i>. I wrote an article called “The Hole in the Wall Gang” as the banks were introducing self-service entities around the country. I was asked by the public relations officer of one of the principal commercial banks to meet him for lunch. He did not achieve much. I will confine myself to the general observation that it is amazing that the public is not organising outside all these institutions to protest against the degrading, shortened, withered level of service being provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There is also the notion of inservice staff training in which members of staff are told that their faces are to break into a glazed smile as they tell customers they cannot move their money from one bank to another unless they walk across the road or that they might not have all their figures correct. This is Ireland, the friendly island. This is how we have evolved, and everyone I meet complains about it. I do not need anyone to send me any more questionnaires or people asking me to take a call at home on my private number and spend 40 minutes saying why a particular bank is not meeting its service to the customers. It is an intrusion into my privacy. I wish they would go away on a reflective weekend and not fire paint at each other or imagine there some kind of macho "laddism" that these people feel they should be involved in. They should just think what their relationship to the public should be. Many members of the public are wising up to it. If a person were to tell me when buying his sandwich, "I am a banker, you know," Members can speculate on the comment he would get.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I have already called for strong representation on the new institution in the context of consumer interests. There should be somebody outside the credit relationship for dealing with the social circumstances surrounding credit and the absence of it. This should concentrate on the notion of people being refused credit and the issues involved in credit reputation. The presence of people from the health boards and MABS, for example, would be immensely valuable.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I remember as a child in Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare seeing the first cattle buyers arrive with cheque books, in white trench coats, usually from Northern Ireland. It created a sensation. I have been watching the evolution of credit. One thing I regard as incredible are tracker bonds. People have advertised these equity-based securities in four or five of the great regions of the trading world, the US or Japanese or European Union stocks or even Irish equities. The question is whether any of them would declare what charges they are taking in the early period of investment. It may be argued that this information is published, but it is not readily available. What, for example, is being earned by alleged management fees? If they are real management fees, where would the consumer who purchased such bonds ever find out about the complex decisions taken by management over a period of time? They are a skim off the customer's savings with no indication as to the service provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">One service that is provided is when people are entitled under existing legislation to be told how their investments are doing. A statement will be made about the world economy, saying in effect: "We have been going through an incredibly difficult two years and as you know when you bought our product we previously had four wonderful years." These were "wonderful years" when equities were flying out of the grass. That is the kind of rubbish being provided for the people who are being sucked into this system. The other side of it is interesting. Regularly the Central Bank, which acts as a kind of purveyor of OECD financial journalism, which is not economics, offers comments to the public on the state of world markets. I hope the Minister will appreciate it is not internal reform that is in question. What is needed is a restructuring in the consumer's and the democratic interest and real sanctions on misrepresentation, language that means something and a body that will make representation in favour of the customers. The suggestion that this Bill will give rise to some new obligation that will fall on these principled people who will interpret it themselves and mumble away is simply not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I suggest that whatever is proposed in this legislation should not close off or quench any existing legal right available to a customer. That is important. Section 8, for example, needs to be looked at carefully. We should remember that while we can indicate the intent of the Bill and the likely consequences of a judicial kind, we cannot function as a substitute or alternative to the existing judicial process, which should be located where sanctions may be applied through the courts. Most importantly, no internal provision of the Bill should quench any right of any consumer as regards the normal legal process.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_122">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The whole issue of the financial institutions and the service they give our country is extremely important. Without strong banking structures and our own banking base, we would have been in much greater difficulties in the years when times were more difficult in Ireland than at present. I will criticise some of the activities of the banks later, but I want to recognise the fact that they have given a good service.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I first turn to the miscellaneous amendments, just in case I run short of time. Sometimes matters termed "miscellaneous" are passed over and forgotten. I notice in the Minister's speech the important issue with regard to the need for amendments to insurance legislation to go beyond purely technical matters. He refers to particular amendments designed to restore the right of an administrator appointed to an insurance company in difficulty to have access to a compensation fund. I raise this because we recently had a situation in my constituency where a company dealing in industrial insurance went out of business, in Clones, County Monaghan. In blunt terms it was one of the major issues that led to the closure of the CPV factory there. It was one of the issues, not all.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I welcome that amendment in this Bill because it is important. The insurance company concerned can be blamed for going for cheaper insurance, but in the present insurance market nobody may be accused of wrong in that context. The same insurance company dealt with many businesses in Northern Ireland and across the water in Britain. Those companies were totally covered under UK legislation, but because CPV was south of the Border, it had to carry its own costs. The tribulations of the company were enormous and some people used the situation to their own benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I pay tribute to those involved who tried to mediate and get the issue sorted. No doubt, this is a welcome concept in this Bill and I support it. The Bill deals with the issue of mergers under miscellaneous amendments. I support this aspect of the Bill. The banking structures have become quite small. There have been many mergers in recent times. If two of the bigger banks in this country were to merge this would have to be seriously examined by the Government because monopoly is a dangerous thing in so far as the consumer and the whole financial services industry is concerned. It is likely they would become more interested — as many of the banks are, at present — in what the shareholders thought rather than what the customer needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Minister indicates that he intends to make amendments on the Committee Stage. I know he has experienced difficulties with the credit union movement in the past and that a major difference had to be brokered between them. I hope this Bill will not impose on the movement, through the backdoor, a regulation that will make it impossible for it to operate in a meaningful way. A regulation in this regard brought before the European Parliament some time ago did not obtain agreement. I am not sure what is the exact intention of this amendment but I will check it out before Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Credit unions provide a tremendous service to their customers. The introduction of a regulation which prevents them lending small amounts will make it impossible for them to operate. All that will do is force people into the hands of moneylenders. This new regulation which is being introduced by way of amendment to current legislation should be reconsidered. I want an assurance from the Minister that is not what is intended because it would have serious consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I know many for whom it would have been impossible to start up in business without assistance from a credit union. Banks will only assist such people when they are established. A credit union will accept a person's word. In many cases employees know the person concerned and his or her family on a personal basis. It is interesting to note that the credit union movement is increasing its number of counter assistants at a time when the banks are cutting back. Banks want to operate via the Internet with as few people as possible visiting branches, yet the credit union movement is making accessibility one of the main planks of its business and is doing an excellent job in that regard. I would not like to be party to a regulation that would impose hardship on the credit union movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I do not suggest the movement should be above structures and should not have to act responsibly. I believe it is responsible. We must ensure the movement is not tied up in red tape when making small loans. If enters the area of providing mortgages or loans of €10,000, €20,000 or €30,000, then it must be regulated in the same manner as banks. It should not be tied to meaningless and unnecessary paperwork for loans of €3,000 or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Deputy Coveney referred earlier to the fact that Deputy Richard Bruton and I visited some small industries in Monaghan. One of the issues about which directors were very concerned was the amount of red tape they encountered. That is all very well if one has a business large enough to employ an accountant as part of the staff, but onerous regulations that force businesses to pay massive sums to outsiders put industry under further pressure. I refer in particular to those businesses unable to gain access to broadband and other facilities. I know that issue was discussed in previous legislation a few months ago. I want to ensure the proposed imposition will not be unbearable.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We need good regulation, not over-regulation. We need to encourage banks to locate here. There has been criticism of some of the changes brought about by banks which have recently located here such as ACC Bank, now owned by Rabobank, and the Bank of Scotland. We must ensure we do not scare them off. With the number of Irish banks diminishing through amalgamation and so on, we need to ensure the banking sector does not end up like the insurance industry where the number of participants is so small there is little room for competition or opportunity. It is important that, in introducing regulation, we do not over-regulate this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The consumer-director will have a major role to play, especially in the insurance sector. I have already highlighted the need to shop around in this regard. There is no doubt that those who shop around the banking structures will get a better deal. Often, it is those starting off in life that are the hardest hit by banks in terms of surcharges and so on. It is not possible for such people to shop around. I hope the Bill will introduce provisions to ensure that can happen. It is important the Minister realises that it is often people at the lower end of the spectrum who are harassed by banks and banking institutions in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">We can all remember, even those who were not Members at the time, when the House was recalled to discuss the difficulties of a major company. I agree with what was done in that case. I know the individual concerned on a personal basis. He was able to overcome his difficulties and his business operates better than ever. Many small businesses blacklisted for a few thousand euro never recover and those concerned are often forced to go on social welfare. They are the issues about which I am concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">As other speakers from my party said, we have no problem with the Bill which provides for the establishment of a financial services ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints, the establishment of consumer and industry consultative panels to advise the regulatory authority, new reporting and auditing obligations for financial institutions and so on. It also provides for a right of appeal, introduces new regulatory requirements and covers many miscellaneous issues. I would like to concentrate on some of these.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Other speakers referred to the establishment of the consumer and industry consultative panels. It is important that the consultative panels include people with a knowledge of consumers and the difficulties they experience. I am concerned that structures agreed in the House often become political. I do not direct my remarks to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. I would say the same to a member of my party if he or she was Minister. People of this highest calibre who are knowledgeable about the industry must be appointed. There is no point in appointing individuals who have been good supporters of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats or any other party. The Bill provides that the Minister for Finance must consult the Tánaiste and Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That means both Government parties are covered and that is worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Consumer groups and voluntary organisations such as MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul must pick up the pieces daily when people experience financial difficulties. They deal with individuals while the Small Firms Association, for example, deals with small businesses. The people and businesses who experience difficulties pay higher charges to the financial institutions generally. Meanwhile, the larger companies can shop around and hire accountants and auditors to put forward a glossy accounts structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I use MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in cases involving my constituents occasionally to minimise the stress and difficulty they experience. A newspaper recently reported that 8,500 people had received treatment for overdoses and suicide attempts. That highlights the stress many people are under in the so-called Celtic tiger economy. I urge the Minister to appoint people with a background in this area and who have knowledge of the difficulties that arise on the ground. MABS employees are wonderful and the public give generously to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, especially at Christmas. Without such organisations, people would be much worse off, including some one would not expect to be in difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Houses are three times more expensive than ten years ago. While interest rates are low compared with rates of more than 20% that were charged in the 1980s, the capital must still be repaid. The capital repayment is significant if ones pays €300,000 rather than €100,000 for a house. In addition, new home owners take out loans to buy furniture, cars and holidays, to clear credit cards and so on. That is fine when everything is going all right but, for example, people still die suddenly. Thankfully, an improved life insurance structure has been implemented but, in the past, even local authority loans had to be repaid following a sudden death, which put enormous pressure on families. People with knowledge of financial needs and difficulties must be considered when making appointments to consultative bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I refer to the administrative structures and the fines proposed in the legislation. Impressive sanctions that may be imposed on a financial service provider are a caution or reprimand, an order to refund a charge, a fine of up to €5 million or an order to pay the costs of the investigation. I welcome the provision of strong penalties but financial institutions are frequently able to avoid them. Last week a business person who had organised a concert for charity was jailed because one of the posters advertising the concert had not been taken down, yet other business people can walk away free from prosecution because they can pay for good advice and the means to be released.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the legislation and the appointment of an ombudsman. The appointments to the board and the consultative committees must include people who have experience in this area. People who are reasonably well off can make their own deals. It is extraordinary that many of our best workers who put their life savings in banks over the years are only earning interest at 1.5% and, therefore, must use the capital to live on while banks charge between 10% and 12% for overdrafts to small customers. This issue must be examined in the context of the profitability of banks. We cannot survive without profit but there should not be abuse and I hope this legislation will lead to the curtailment of abuses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_123">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I welcome the Bill but I have a few concerns that the Minister of State might consider and address. When I was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, I chaired an international review of the Irish Financial Services Centre and a number of heavy hitters from Boston and New York provided their services free to the State to participate in the review. I met a cross-section of domestic and international interests from the financial services sector in New York and Boston to discuss their views about the IFSC.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I was briefed to discuss the positive environment in Ireland, the common law system and highlight that we are an English speaking people committed to the European Union, the euro, low interest rates and the certainty that brought, tax rates and so on. However, Americans were interested in investing in Ireland because, according to one senior entrepreneur, they had found in Dublin an enterprising spirit and work ethic that had not been experienced in New York for 25 years. That was an eye opening comment. Every morning the traffic jams begin earlier because workers are heading to their offices in the IFSC earlier and they finish later because there are rewards. That is welcome because I believe in encouraging and rewarding enterprise. The IFSC generates one third of all corporate tax receipts, even though the rate has been reduced to 10%, and the centre also accounts for 7,500 jobs. The Americans also mentioned that the same scenario applied in Luxembourg but at certain times of the year they had to bring half their staff from the United States to Luxembourg because they could not recruit locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I was struck this morning by the forecast for development in Dublin over the next decade and the lack of suitably qualified personnel to take on the high-tech jobs which will come on stream. I suspect that in the international financial services sector, we are in danger of going down the same road as Luxembourg if we do not constantly keep that situation under review. That would have serious implications for us. Luxembourg is on mainland Europe and it is easy to move around from there. One can attract staff from Germany and Belgium easily. We do not have the same luxury, therefore we need to attend to that issue if the financial services sector is to continue to be vibrant. I ask the Minister to ensure this issue is kept strongly and actively under review. The availability of a workforce with an ethic which they had not seen for a quarter of a century in New York was one of the great attractions, greater than the tax rate and the other attractions through which we sold the IFSC.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The new development of an EU-wide company has been proposed. This would be set up under an EU statute and with EU-wide powers, not just an Irish company trading in France or Germany. Rather, it would be a European company which would be to the European Union what an Irish company is to Ireland, set up under its own statutes and under European law. This proposal is at an advanced stage and is coming our way quickly. I do not know what the implications of that will be for the Central Bank, the financial services authority or this Bill. For example, will the remit of the ombudsman and the council extend to European companies or is there a need for a specific provision to ensure that companies set up in such a manner would be subject to the full implications of this Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I welcome the provision of a financial services ombudsman and council and hope it will create greater transparency in the financial services sector. I suspect that most of us are, at certain times in our lives, just grateful to get an overdraft facility, a loan or a mortgage and sometimes we do not question how much it costs or what are the bank charges. I am aware we get a separate bank statement showing the charges, but there is no real competition. One does not know whether one would be better off with one bank rather than another. There is a need for greater transparency and competition in this area and a need for the financial services authority to perhaps create an awareness among people that there is competition and that it would be wise for them to shop around.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The psychological relationship between banker and customer is one which favours the bank, and most customers do not want to ask questions for fear it might be held against them when that rainy day comes. However, that is no longer acceptable. There needs to be a change in the relationship between banker and customer. Customers' rights, particularly in terms of explaining exactly what one is paying for a financial service, need to be more transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I am concerned about the danger that over-lending in the housing sector could give rise to difficulties for financial institutions in future. I have no evidence it will happen, nor do I wish to scaremonger, but it is not unreasonable to suspect that house prices in Dublin may well be overvalued, particularly if they continue to rise as they have been. Not so long ago in Britain, negative equity became the order of the day and people were handing back their keys, saying that they could not continue to make their repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I would like to hear what role the Central Bank and financial services authority will have where lending is a multiple of the borrower's income. I do not want to discourage banks from lending. Again, I suspect when most of us took our first mortgages, we went in deep, took what we could and survived. However, I wonder if there are implications in regard to the ratio of lending by banks and financial institutions for the stability of the banking and financial services sector into the future. If there are, will there be someone there to apply the brakes at an appropriate time before something calamitous occurs?</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I welcome the provision for the chairperson of the council to be required to appear before a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This should be a standard provision in every Bill, as is the case more and more, which is welcome. However, I note there is no sanction if the chairperson does not appear. Will the Minister point out how he sees such a sanction applying? I recognise that the Bill provides that there are certain matters which should not be discussed by the chairperson while an investigation is ongoing but there should be some provision in the Bill, perhaps for the failure of a person to appear before a committee. That could be reported to both Houses and would become a matter of concern, which could be raised on the floor of either House. There is no penalty in the Bill. It does not, for example, provide that the Minister may suspend a chairperson who refuses to attend or that the committee could recommend such a sanction. I welcome the provision but I am nervous of provisions which give powers to the Houses of the Oireachtas but do not provide for a penalty when those powers are not applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">There is a Contempt of Parliament Act in the United Kingdom under which, if a person fails to comply with a lawful request to attend before a committee or at the bar of the House of Commons, such a person can be made to account for it. I do not know how we should deal with that situation here. Natural justice must apply and people's good names have to be protected, but this is something which can be done, particularly if the right legal advice is available to the committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Will the Minister deal with that point in his reply?</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the general provisions of the Bill. I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words and I am sure the Minister will take into account some of the concerns which I have raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_298">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and to address points on the banking and credit sectors in society. I have developed a personal view recently that something is awry in the Irish banking, financial services and credit sectors which, according to words I heard when I was growing up, "will all end in tears". I am increasingly fearful of the results of the massive increase in borrowing and personal credit which has been raised for various uses. Unfortunately, the council, ombudsmen and regulatory authorities for which we are legislating will be hugely important in future years if we allow this massive increase in personal borrowing to continue, particularly should there be changed circumstances in our economy or society. That is what makes these legislative provisions important.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I am not biased. I was interested to hear Deputy Michael D. Higgins's views of the banking sector and agree with many of them. He spoke of going to lunch with a public relations officer of one of the main banks. That may well have been my father who fulfilled one of those functions in years gone by. While Deputy Higgins failed to be convinced by my father, I am sure there would be little difference between the two of them on such matters. I come from a long line of bankers, going back to both my grandfathers and even further. I do not speak these words of warning from a jaundiced position of distrust or dislike of bankers but because I fear that what is happening represents a dangerous change in the way banking operates in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">My grandfather once told me a story of his first day as manager of a bank in Macroom which he referred to as the premier branch in the country. A seemingly reputable young man sought a loan to buy cattle and assured my grandfather that the deal was a clever one. My grandfather, thrilled to be giving out money for the first time, loaned the customer what at the time was a huge amount of money. When he was walking home that evening along a dark country road my grandfather met the man to whom he had lent the money. He was lying unconscious in a ditch having taken too much drink. He had not drunk all the money and my grandfather vividly described how it was blowing down the road. He spent his first evening in his new job chasing the money down the country road in the dark and picking it out of the puddles. This was a lesson for him for the rest of his time in banking. I would not like to have tried to borrow money from my grandfather. He was a tough man to persuade to loosen his purse, but sometimes that is not a bad thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">In the early history of the State and until recently we were too conservative in our lending. The Department of Finance was incredibly conservative in the first 40 years of its operation. The inability of that Department to free the country's purse strings before the end of the 1950s did huge damage to our State. I do not advocate an austere hairshirt approach and no lending. However, what is happening at present is at the other end of the spectrum and all the parties involved will suffer tremendously.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">As I prepared this speech in my office, I happened to glance at my desk and found, among my post, a document from the National Association of Regional Game Councils — a laudable body with which I do not have dealings — informing me that I could get preferential loans exclusive to its members. I could also get a credit card which offers so much more than other cards, financial flexibility and superb benefits. There is no restriction on the loans I could get and I could buy any make or age of car. No deposit, savings or upfront payments would be required. As a member of this association, which unfortunately I am not, I could obtain just about anything I wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Last week in my post I received a letter from the ESB — not known in the past as a credit organisation — offering to give me €5,000 of credit because I was such a good customer. The ESB wanted to lend me money and get into the game of making interest from my having an extra fridge, video or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">My wife was in her bank branch two weeks ago. It is one of the four main clearing banks and my wife has a standard and unremarkable current account from which she wanted to withdraw €50 or €100. The bank official, in a conspiratorial and friendly manner, whispered to her and asked her if she realised she had been approved for a loan of €20,000. My wife wanted to withdraw €50 and had made no approach or loan application. The bank had seen that her account was trundling along, doing no harm and decided she was a person to whom it could loan €20,000. These are symptoms of the massive credit explosion which is occurring in our county and which, if we are not careful, will lead to real difficulties when we need to change our economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It is important that the regulator begins by examining some of the practices of our financial institutions. Just about everyone is now offering free credit and 0% finance for the first number of years. There is no control of what is happening in this area and we desperately need to impose it before it results in trouble for the financial and commercial institutions and companies involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">There is huge concern regarding the mortgage market. A reputable banker who spoke to me on this subject said he felt that banks themselves have played a large part in the house price increases of recent times. It is hard for us to believe that banks were not engaged in the mortgage business until ten or 20 years ago. They left it to building societies and credit unions. Their aggressive move into the mortgage sector, at a time when the Central Bank and every international financial institution is saying that Ireland's house prices are over-valued and that this will lead to trouble could be hugely damaging in future if we have a downturn in the housing or jobs markets. The banks must look at what will happen if that occurs and they are faced with repossessions on a massive scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The introduction of lending facilities such as the interest-only mortgage facility has added to this effect. Someone buying a second property, usually to be rented, is offered an interest-only mortgage for the first number of years on the assumption that there will be a capital gain on the property which will help pay off the capital sum when the time comes. This is a dangerous lending policy which will have huge ramifications. If there is an economic downturn when these people seek to sell their properties and retrieve their capital, they will make a loss. What will banks do then with all the properties they might have to repossess? This issue will be hugely important and one which the ombudsman must examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Whatever about his role as President, Deputy Michael D. Higgins would make an excellent financial regulator or member of the board of the regulatory body. It has been recommended that someone from outside the financial services industry would bring a different perspective on lending and credit. We do not want to hear the same voices from the banking, industrial and commercial world who think everything is proceeding brilliantly, all the institutions are making money and the customers are happy to be able to buy their 04D registered cars. It would be no harm to have someone on the regulatory board who will be prepared to say the emperor has no clothes, that there is madness afoot and that we need to restrict the type of lending that is taking place. I was interested in what Deputy Richard Bruton said earlier about how we in the Oireachtas relate to regulators. Yesterday the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources had a nine-hour meeting with ComReg, to which the Deputy referred. As usual great work goes on in the committees of which the public may be unaware. While I have spent the past year reviewing the telecoms area with my fellow committee members, yesterday's nine-hour meeting represented the masters on top of the basic degree we had completed in the past year and we learned much from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">In hindsight I believe ComReg made a poor decision in changing the conditions that applied to Eircom's cap. One of ComReg's responses was to ask the committee why it failed to advise and give its opinions during the nine-month consultation period prior to the decision. This was a valid point. However, as Members of the Oireachtas we do not have time and tend to be reacting to events. We find it difficult to follow all the regulators that now exist. In the communications, marine and natural resources portfolio, there are at least three — ComReg, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Broadcasting Commission, which is a form of regulator. We need to consider a formal structure of communications between Oireachtas Members and the regulators, and our reviewing of them in order that we do a better job.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">A model of how this might work may lie in our scrutiny of European regulations. A dedicated sub-committee reviews those regulations and recommends to committees whether they should closely scrutinise particular directives. The same should apply to our review of and work with the financial and other regulators with which this House has to deal. We could develop a system that allows the committee to be flagged to review important upcoming decisions. A committee cannot spend all its time looking over the shoulder of a regulator. Once in every year or two a regulator might advise a committee to review a crucial decision with important long-term consequences. While we should not consider every directive, when there is an important regulatory decision a regulator should notify the committee, the Minister or other body depending on how it is structured. This should work well. If the committees are resourced properly they can become a very useful tool in providing outside analysis and act as a sounding board for regulatory decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I listened to the Minister's speech with interest. He referred to the miscellaneous amendments in the Bill, which are largely of a technical nature. He rightly picked out two as having particular significance. The first amendment restores the right of an administrator appointed to an insurance company in difficulty to have access to the insurance compensation fund. In his speech the Minister trumpeted the fact that since the famous collapses of the ICI and PMPA in the 1980s, there has not been a major insurance failure in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I beg to differ with the Minister. When I was first elected to this House I had to deal with representations from people affected by the collapse of the UK company, Independent Insurance. While this was a British company it had a significant branch operation here. Under the interpretation of existing regulations by the Government, it was decided that those who lost out in that collapse were not entitled to access to the funds they had been paying in as a tax since the establishment of the insurance levy. This was a particularly unfair judgment by the Government. Those who have been paying the 2% levy to cover the cost of any such collapse find that when their insurance provider collapses they get nothing, as the headquarters happen to be in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Most insurance companies operating here are similarly arranged. Most do not have an Irish headquarters but one elsewhere. As someone in the insurance industry advised me today, anyone setting up an insurance company today would not do so here, but would go to somewhere like Gibraltar or elsewhere where there are much lower capital requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">If the Minister is to address how the insurance levy is administered, I hope he will consider accepting an amendment we may propose to the effect that the ability of an administrator to have access to the fund should not be limited to companies based in Ireland but should extend to all companies operating under branch licence or freedom of services operation with an Irish business here. The Government cannot collect the levy and refuse people access to avail of it. I am not talking about helping the businesses in question, which through their own fault may have collapsed, but about Irish consumers affected by such collapses through no fault of their own. As this seems to be the intent of this Bill, I hope the Minister will amend it to broaden the scope of where the insurance compensation fund may apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Another amendment mentioned by the Minister is far from a miscellaneous one and is very significant and interesting. This is his desire to maintain control over mergers and acquisitions within Irish banking contrary to the recommendations of the McDowell report. I agree with the Minister on this. It is important not to let the market decide the development and structure in the Irish banking industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">How much control will the Minister have even if he changes the legislation to keep certain controls within his Department? Given that the shareholding of major Irish banks is now largely in New York, London or Frankfurt, their future is not really in the hands of Irish people let alone the Government. It would be hard for the Minister to restrict a merger or acquisition in this area. If the board of Deutsche Bank in Germany decides that an Irish bank is an attractive acquisition I cannot see how the Minister could have control over that. Where possible and where he has the powers he should exercise them. It is important that we maintain an indigenous Irish banking industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">At the start I spoke about how banking works and my experience of it. I was always told it was about risk assessment. It judges whether a person is a decent character who will make a business work, not squander the money and be able to pay the bank back. In the Irish banking market we have developed a completely different culture, where quarterly objectives must be met and sales must be made rather than making a judgment on the character of the person. When banking decisions are made outside Ireland that assessment of risk of character or operation of a company becomes more difficult and there is a strong case for maintaining a close contact between the Irish banking community and its customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">There is also an important requirement for banks to go back to their core business of analysing risk and character. They should not lend money in the hope that they will obtain an immediate and welcome return on interest while failing to take into account the consequences of customers not being able to pay or resolve difficulties in which they find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I enjoyed the opportunity to speak on the Bill. While my party supports it, we hope the Minister might consider certain small amendments on Committee Stage designed to improve its intent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_320">I welcome the Bill. I am glad that a mechanism designed to protect consumers has been brought forward because it is badly needed. For many years banking institutions have creamed off major profits by imposing many charges. Banks will always enjoy profits but customers will never do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I agree with my party's spokesperson on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, who stated that the financial services regulator must immediately investigate whether bank customers are being ripped off in terms of interest rates. For a long period banks have imposed many additional fees and charges. The two largest such institutions have had the market to themselves and introduced a huge number of extra charges over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Deputy Coveney referred earlier to the initiative introduced late last year by Fine Gael whereby people can log on to the <i>ripoff.ie</i> website and inform the party of instances where they were ripped off. Many banking institutions have been referred to in communications to the website from people who were ripped off by the imposition of additional charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Many Members referred to instances where they were ripped off by banks. Interest rates are extremely low. In such circumstances, banks recoup the money they would otherwise make if rates were high by imposing additional charges. For example, people are charged for making withdrawals, writing cheques, etc. I have spoken to a number of business people who deal with banks on a daily basis. I refer to those who run supermarkets and need to lodge large amounts of cash or write numerous cheques. They told me that colossal bank charges were imposed on them which made a major dent in their end of year profits. It is sad that business people trying to create gainful employment in their local communities are being charged exorbitant fees by banks. I accept that banks must also make profits but the charges they have imposed over many years are unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Reference was made to the ease with which people can borrow money from banks. Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to the ESB offering him credit and his wife being offered a loan by her bank. On each occasion one opens the newspaper, a small leaflet from a banking institution offering loans or credit cards will fall out. This is especially true of Sunday newspapers. One could spend a great deal of time on Sunday reading the leaflets in the newspapers that come from lending banks and lending institutions such as the PTSB and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">People who have difficulties with banks visit my clinic on a regular basis. I was visited last weekend by a farmer who stated that he was suicidal because of the pressure exerted on him by a bank — I will not name it — in my county. He had an overdraft of €6,000 which he had exceeded by €3,000 and was thus in debt to the tune of €9,000. The bank held the deeds to his 150 acre farm, his house and another property he owned.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The man in question experienced financial difficulties in the past. He was £90,000 in debt but he paid off every penny. Before Christmas, he was not allowed to write cheques or withdraw money from the bank and was extremely disappointed with the way it had treated him. Representatives of the bank contacted him each day to see when he was going to pay off his overdraft. By today's standards, €9,000 is not a great deal of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The man in question only told me his story on Saturday last but the matter first arose before Christmas. It was dreadful that he was informed at that stage that he could not write a cheque, even for €200 or whatever. He had a bleak Christmas. I understand that the account was held jointly in his wife's name. For the purposes of discussion, let us say that their names are Michael and Mary. What puzzled both him and me was that, last week, his wife received a letter from the bank inquiring whether she wanted a loan to buy a new car or carry out house renovations and informing her that she could obtain a loan up to the amount of €15,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I do not understand how the bank could send this letter to Mary when only weeks ago it was putting her husband under pressure because he had exceeded his overdraft facility by €3,000. That was bad business. I have asked someone to meet representatives of the bank to discover exactly what is the situation. Under no circumstances should a customer be treated in this manner, especially, as in this case, by one of the two major banking institutions. I was surprised by what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Banks have no difficulty lending money. However, if people cannot keep up their payments, banks will show no mercy and will not offer to help out. In recent years they have been giving money away and offering loans and credit cards in leaflets in daily or Sunday newspapers. I have often received letters from my local bank stating that I have been approved for loans of €20,000 or €30,000 and that all I need do is tick a box, sign my name and return the letter. Other banking institutions not based in Wexford but located in the south-east are doing the same. People can obtain car loans, etc., without difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I feel strongly about the services offered by the banks. Old people are regularly advised not to carry large amounts of cash or hoard cash at home. They are told to put money into the bank, post office or credit union. However, in last year's budget the Minister imposed a charge on credit cards. That galls me. On the one hand, we have been encouraging people to carry a credit card but, on the other, we are charging them for doing so. Where is the encouragement in this? The charge on the credit card is only a small amount but where is the sense in charging a person for carrying the card after encouraging him or her to get one? I could go further and discuss gardaí on the streets but that does not relate to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Many old people will not use banks now. They are afraid to bank. They see no security in banking and have lost confidence in it. Before my involvement in politics I worked as a sales representative and had a customer base of between 300 and 400 customers. If €10,000 worth of goods was sold to, let us say, Paddy Doyle and he was not paying the money, the financial controller of any company could ring up the bank to ask how much money he had in his account. That is happening on an ongoing basis in every major business dealing with cash transactions and waiting for money from customers. If somebody asked the financial controller if he or she was doing this, he or she would deny it. Since he or she has contacts in banks such as Bank of Ireland, the AIB, Permanent TSB or the ACC, he or she can ring them and say: "How much has Paul Kehoe in his account? When did he last write a cheque? I have a cheque from him for €10,000, so will you ring me back when he has that amount in his account so I can go to the bank and cash the cheque?" I feel strongly about this. It is happening everywhere. Why should anybody be allowed to do this?</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Another important issue is student loans and credit cards. Students are encouraged to carry credit cards. When I was 18 years old, a student had to work at weekends. Under no circumstances could they get a loan. Students never carried a credit card because they could not get one. Now, however, a chap aged between 17 to 20 years can get a credit card without any problem. He simply fills in an application form. The new board proposed in the Bill could examine this practice and clamp down on it. It should not be allowed. It ends up frightening young people. They are given loans which they cannot repay or get into trouble with their credit cards over Christmas or whatever period.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I listened to a radio programme before last Christmas in which a number of young people between the ages of 18 and 25 years told harrowing stories of their experiences over the previous Christmas. They had got loans or used their credit cards to buy presents and so forth and the banks immediately clamped down on them when they could not repay the money. How will they in later years be able to take out loans to buy a house or a car? If they had a bad record when they were aged between 18 and 25 years, that record will continue to exist when they are 30 years of age, when they might be thinking of getting married and taking out a loan to buy a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Fees are charged for writing cheques just as there is a charge on credit cards. Cheque books are extremely handy, particularly for older people. They do not have to keep cash in the house. However, they are being charged exorbitant fees for using their cheque book. Banks are moving further away from the customer. Deputy Michael D. Higgins spoke about the telephone calls he receives from banks on his private number. I have received the same calls. The caller rings and asks if one is available for a 15 to 20 minute question time the following evening at 6 p.m. The caller is generally from one of the main banks. I do not have an account in one of the banks whose caller contacted me and do not know how they got my number or why they were ringing me. Out of curiosity, I agreed to take the call. The caller spent 20 minutes on the line. I asked why they were ringing me when I did not have an account in their bank. The caller replied that they were carrying out a survey in which they were ringing account holders and non-account holders to find out what type of service the bank should give to the customer.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">It was a little strange. I was asked what bank I used but I did not tell them that. I was also asked how much money I might have in the bank and what type of service I might use, whether it was a daily, weekly or monthly service. I was asked if I had a credit card or ATM card. The questions were about private and confidential matters. I was always told to keep three things to myself — my religion, bank account and politics. This caller was ringing about one of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">It is probable that every Member of the House has a bank account. I always encourage people to open a bank account because it is safer to do so. However, I am a member of the local credit union in Enniscorthy. I have never received a questionnaire or telephone call from a credit union on how to improve its service to the customer. I have rarely seen an advertisement in a newspaper for a credit union and have never seen a television advertisement for one. However, each time I call to the credit union office in Enniscorthy, it is packed with people. I have never gone to that office and seen only three or four in the queue. That is true of every credit union.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The reason is that the credit union offers a genuine service. It will give the customer every support it can. If he or she falls into arrears, it will do all it can to help him or her. The bank does the opposite. It will give a customer a loan as soon as he or she signs his or her name. If one seeks a loan from the credit union, the board has a meeting to decide if one should get it. Its members will consider whether the customer will be able to meet the repayments. More than likely it will be local people on the board and they will know the customer or know somebody who knows something about him or her. They will find out if he or she will be able to make the repayments and if the loan application is genuine.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Banks are different. They simply look at the customer's name, address, date of birth, salary and place of work and give the loan. However, if he or she falls into arrears, they will bring him or her to court to get the money back or take what he or she has. Many families and business people have had bad experiences with banks. Credit unions operate in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I was involved in voluntary organisations. Many such organisations have a registered number as a charity whereby they are exempt from bank charges. I was treasurer of my local branch of Macra na Feirme for three years. It was charged a small amount by the bank every year and I had to telephone the bank every year and ask it to drop the charges. I was not annoyed about the money, but about the fact that the bank knew it was wrong to charge an organisation which was a registered charity. I do not know why it did that.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The same is true for penny banks. A woman rang me recently to complain that she had been charged DIRT and banking charges on the penny bank. The small community in Blackwater in County Wexford operate the penny bank twice a week, on Friday and Saturday nights. The penny bank is not worthwhile because it makes little profit as a result of banking charges. The senior citizens' party in the area is funded by the profits from the penny bank. However, the little profit it makes means it is a waste of time. How does that encourage people to save money in banks?</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Bank of Ireland and the AIB are two of the major banks in rural Ireland. However, they do not care about rural Ireland. There are few small towns and villages with a major banking institution because most of them are closed. The Bank of Ireland in Enniscorthy closed its branch in Ferns. It does not care about the people in that area. They can go to Wexford, Enniscorthy or Gorey. The bank's attitude is that if the people want to bank, they can go to their nearest branch.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I hope the board of this authority is not made up of political appointments. I repeat what Deputy Coveney said this morning, namely, the board will only be as good as the people on it. I hope I will not be critical of this board in the future. I hope it will be a good board which will work in the best interests of the consumers. I look forward to its establishment and I hope the people on it will work extremely hard. I am glad they will be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I commend the Bill to the House and hope it works.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_343">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Reference was made to the ombudsman and the financial regulator. We live in the regulation era and we have become accustomed to regulators in recent years. It looks like we will have more of the same. It should be recognised that regulators have a number of jobs. They must ensure there is fair play in the marketplace and that restrictive practices are not in operation. They must deal with the customers of the services they regulate in a fair and equitable manner. They should operate in such a way to ensure competition prevails and that the consumers' interests are kept to the fore in any debate or action taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The introduction of the ombudsman in this legislation is interesting, progressive and challenging. I am sure many people can recite stories about the way they have been treated by financial institutions. I am not criticising all financial institutions as some of them treat their customers in a fair and equitable manner. Others, however, believe their only loyalty is to their shareholders. When the euro was introduced, for example, the banks and financial institutions howled from the highest platforms that it would be the end of their profits, that they would suffer severe penalties as a result of the currency exchange rates and that it was a restrictive era for banking. When I read the annual and six monthly reports for the banking institutions, I was amazed to find that their profits did not fall, but that they increased substantially. I am happy that they are continuing to increase. However, how could they tell all and sundry that they would not be able to exist in the future? The banks shed crocodile tears before the introduction of the euro. However, their fears did not materialise.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">There is a lot of investment in financial and international financial services. However, we must accept, whether we like it, that we have become uncompetitive. There are a variety of reasons for that which must be considered, including those associated with activities in the financial services sector. The differential between the amount paid in interest to depositors and the amount charged to borrowers is interesting. The variation of 4.74% is considerably higher than in most other European countries. That is one third higher than the average in the nine EU countries covered in one survey. It is significant that our close competitor and immediate trading partner, the United Kingdom, has a variation of only 0.33%. It operates from a dramatically lower margin. The regulator has not had an effect in that area, but I hope the ombudsman will.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">We have been told that we have the lowest inflation rate in Europe. However, the cost of goods in our supermarkets and the services people use, such as the telephone and electricity, has accelerated beyond that indicated in the consumer price index. I do not know how the Government has managed to do this. I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, is as confused as I am. I have tried to find out the reason. It is contradictory when the Government tells us, on the basis of the CPI, that interest rates are low and we should be happy, while every other indicator for the past five years shows that the cost of the goods for which the consumer must pay on an annual basis has gone through the roof.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_347">That is because the Deputy is being selective.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_348">The downside of that argument is that the CPI must also be selective. It must be avoiding the consumer goods which previously gave an accurate record of our inflation rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">What is more interesting is that five or six years ago this economy was regarded as one of the five most competitive economies in Europe and one of the most competitive in the world. We can talk until tomorrow about financial services and how sophisticated we have become, but there is something wrong because now we are one of the least competitive countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">This has happened over five years and we are fast becoming one of the least competitive economies in Europe and countries in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Government spokespersons say in response to this that ours is no longer a low wage economy, as if that was a great achievement. Jobs are relocated from this economy to what we deem low wage economies from which we will import the goods that we once produced. The employment will go to those in another economy. There is a serious gap between financial services and competitiveness where this inflation is taking place and it has not been exposed. Those who suggest we have achieved the ultimate by becoming a high wage economy should know that will lead to large-scale relocation of jobs from here to competitive economies, not necessarily low wage economies. The new post of financial ombudsman should have real teeth to challenge the financial services sectors and query the charges they impose on customers, consequently creating the problem of rising prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Politicians nowadays must have a political account. Between elections, when nothing is withdrawn, this account diminishes because someone is managing it. What management is involved? If the Ceann Comhairle were to give me €200 in the morning to mind, I would keep it, have the use of it, and do anything I liked with it as long as I had it. Why should I reduce it by a specific amount every six months just because I had the loan of it? That is what financial service providers do all the time. Countless people have accounts which are inactive for a period yet the sum in the account is reduced, allegedly for management. That practice needs to be examined carefully with a view to ensuring that the consumer is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">One would expect confidentiality in the payments and charges applied by financial institutions. That is not the case, especially these days. As a previous speaker said, it is quite possible for a person to obtain information on an individual account holder to ensure that the business the person may have with the account holder is guaranteed and secure. That is business and it involves risks, winning some and losing some. Under the present system financial institutions never lose. Only the consumer loses. This issue, which has been raised by several Members, requires consideration and I hope that the ombudsman will take cognisance of it and deal with it when the time comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">In case one believes consumers are getting away lightly, two years ago my colleague, the Minister for Finance, imposed a penalty on credit cards with one stroke of his pen. Consumers were already paying a penalty on current accounts. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is my constituency colleague, a nice man of whom I am very fond and who does good things for people. However, he decided this was a way to make money for the Government, not to provide equity and fairness to the consumer. It was a brilliant stroke but how can it be explained to the consumer in the marketplace? I am waiting for someone from Government to tell us this. Everyone has been encouraged for security purposes to get a credit card to move away from carrying cash and writing cheques. We were to use plastic, the "flexible friend", yet once again the consumer has been caught. This is the rip-off society. The Government is dipping its greedy paws into consumers' pockets to ensure that they not get too far away.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">This legislation proposes to introduce consultative panels and I do not doubt that various organisations will be called on to provide personnel for these panels. I hope that will be the case, that they will be picked at random and will not all be Government supporters singing from the same hymn sheet. Whatever happens by way of penalty to the consumer must be approved by the consumer panel because another trend is gaining ground in our regulated society.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">If the regulator believes there is insufficient profit available to encourage a competitor into the marketplace, he or she may increase prices to make it attractive. I have heard and read a great deal about competition but have never yet encountered a situation where a price increase was encouraged to attract another competitor into the market at a certain level. This is a contradiction but there are some areas where this is the theme. It has not happened in the financial services area yet but I have no doubt that it will happen there. I do not know who thought of it or what is the underlying business concept. I have never heard of it before. The bottom line must surely be that the consumer has to receive an adequate and fair service at a competitive price while ensuring that there is sufficient investment to continue the service, whatever that may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">There is no danger that there will be a fall-off in investment in this area. A few years ago we were warned that, when the euro was introduced, the poor banks would starve and go by the wall. This conjured up visions of the heads of banks starving to death outside their institutions, and poverty and destruction descending upon our economy. However, it did not happen that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">In the event of a breach of the regulations, unfair treatment of the consumer or unfair competition what action can the ombudsman take? Will it be a case of, "Dear Sir or Madam, I noticed you were a little bit off-line. It think it might be a good idea if you changed your tactics." What will be the real penalty? Will it be a couple of million euro, to be imposed daily as long as the action continues? This is an issue which should be looked at very carefully. The whole concept of the merging of the side-by-side activities of the regulator and the ombudsman will depend on how effective each is and what way penalties will be applied in the event of there being penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">By February this year, ECB interest rates will have fallen two full points, from 4.75% to2.75%. Needless to say, that full reduction has not been passed on to consumers. This is where it disappears into oblivion in the inner vaults — no pun intended — of the financial institutions. I am sure it is good for the financial institutions. I do not wish to be critical because I realise that we must have a stable financial services sector and a stable economy. If we do not have a stable financial services sector and banking system, we will not have it at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Why do we need these regulators? I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts at the time of the Allfirst banking debacle. I recall asking why someone in the Central Bank or the banking centre, the parent body of the bank concerned, did not pick up a telephone before the $700 million dollar fraud took place pointing out that there appeared to be a bit of a problem, that the bank seemed to be over-stretching itself over the last six months, which appeared to be unhealthy, and asking what could be done about it. The reply I was given, which I have no reason to disbelieve it, was that notwithstanding the availability of the much vaunted modern technology, computerisation, etc., the on-line system we all know about, it was virtually possible to siphon off almost the entire assets of a financial institution in this country by a subsidiary from outside the State without anyone knowing about it. I believed it because it was what we were told. Therefore, I would issue a warning.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">My good friend and constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, stated at the end of his speech — I almost missed it — that he intends to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage. One set of amendments will deal with concerns raised by, among others, the European Central Bank in regard to the new provisions and sanctions and the appeals tribunal. The second set of substantive amendments will respond to a reasoned opinion from the European Commission about the current exclusion of credit unions from the terms of the consumer credit directives. This was a small reference at the end of the his statement. The Minister will be pleased to know that I am looking forward to the debate on that issue. This is a subject which has been visited previously. I have a funny feeling that the consumers who currently invest in credit unions, or borrow from credit unions, are about to receive a visitation from the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003. The Bill provides for a statutory financial services ombudsman to deal with complaints against financial institutions, consumer and industry consultative panels to advise the regulatory authority, new reporting and auditing obligations for financial institutions as recommended in the report of the review group on auditing, which is important. It also provides for power for the regulatory authority to impose sanctions directly on financial institutions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, subject to a right of appeal to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal, a right of appeal to the appeals tribunal in regard to certain supervisory decisions of the authority, new regulatory requirements for money transmission and bureau de change businesses to combat money-laundering and the financing of terrorism and miscellaneous other amendments to financial services legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">This Bill is very welcome. The DIRT report recommended that a single regulator should address ethics, professional standards and corporate governance in the provision of financial services in Ireland. The Bill will go a long way towards achieving this goal. The Oireachtas will have a role to play in overseeing the work of regulators such as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and its parent body, the Central Bank. It is important that the Central Bank should be accountable. Following the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, under the chairmanship of the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, and the collection of unpaid taxes, it is important that the committee should invite both bodies in to discuss their renewed powers and the changes and level of responsibility of the Central Bank. These bodies should be held accountable to an Oireachtas committee. I intend to bring them before the Committee of Public Accounts at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The Bill is to be broadly welcomed. As well as a number of technical matters, it allows for the creation of a financial services ombudsman to represent consumers in complaints against banks, building societies and other financial institutions. This is important given the number of complaints. The level of profits generated by the banks is extraordinary. There is almost a charge now to go inside the door of a bank. There are hidden charges. Some banks make almost €3 million daily. This is a form of indirect taxation. There are opportunities for them to reduce interest charges. Many years ago interest charges were a problem. Interest charges have decreased but other charges have been introduced. If one receives a loan from a bank, one is charged a commissioning fee. These are all stacked-up charges which should be regulated. There should be standard banking charges, whether in retail banking or consumer charges for banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Deputy Durkan referred to credit card charges. Given that the Government introduced taxation on credit cards, the Minister might consider the possibility of having a once-off charge on credit cards. Being reissued with a credit card means an additional tax. Some people can pay up to €200 a year taxation on credit cards. The level of credit card charges generates considerable revenue, which is another indirect form of taxation. Given that the banks are now obliged to be more transparent in their dealings, it is important that the Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill and the Central Bank live up to their responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The banks have a major responsibility to consumers. It has recently been brought to the attention of Mr. Frank Daly of the Revenue Commissioners that many banks facilitated the opening of offshore accounts. The DIRT inquiry demonstrated that there was a massive exodus of cash out of the country to the Isle of Man, Jersey and other tax havens. One must question the amount of tax that was paid on these accounts. I am delighted that the banks are now co-operating fully with the Revenue Commissioners and making available their balance sheets. The figures gleaned from this exercise will demonstrate that there was a quite startling level of facilitation of tax evasion by banks. It can no longer be accepted that any financial institution of the State can accommodate tax evasion. I am delighted that the Revenue Commissioners are dealing with the problem decisively.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">In the United States, the credibility of the accountancy profession and the corporate sector was brought into question by the number of certificates that were signed in respect of certain accounts. It was wrong that those doing exceptionally well and who had received money from unknown sources were facilitated by Irish financial institutions in opening certain accounts that allowed them to evade tax. It was wrong that any financial institution in the State felt that it was accommodating the customer in doing so. The financial institutions now feel they have paid, but they should be penalised heavily.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The establishment of a consumer and industry consultative panel to advise the IFSRA is also very important. I am not sure how the panel is composed but it is important that the Minister include on it consumers and those on the lower end of the scale. Such people now tend to go to credit unions and not to banks. Unfortunately, the days of the bank manager in the small town are definitely gone.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_370">They have been replaced by the computer. The gentleman in the local bank is now just like a checkout cashier. If the relevant information one requires does not come up on the screen, he will refer the matter to the main office in Sligo or wherever it may be. The level of involvement has decreased.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Minister has been very good regarding tax incentives to facilitate the growth of small towns. I appreciate that he has encouraged and extended the upper Shannon scheme. A small bank in a small town could have up to €35 million or €40 million on deposit. The banks are obliged by law to reinvest part of such capital in their own areas to encourage enterprise, but in certain cases they do not do so. Sometimes they do not invest in the parts of the country where considerable sums have been deposited and they relocate the deposits to what may be a safe investment elsewhere. Banks are very much devoid of sentiment and will not give anyone a free lunch, but it is clear that they should honour their obligations in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Bill will provide for new reporting and auditing obligations for financial bodies. It is very welcome that the regulatory authority is being given the power to impose sanctions on those financial institutions which fail to comply with the rules. It is important that the body act on the legislative power afforded to it by the Bill. We want decisive action, and a high level of service is critical for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">It is equally important that large and small businesses, borrowers of small amounts, those doing business privately and students are not ripped off. We have a rip-off culture and the banks have definitely ripped off consumers in every possible way. If one were to carry out a value for money comparison with other jurisdictions, such as Northern Ireland and Great Britain, one would discover that the banks in Ireland have made an exorbitant profit in recent years. This should be subject to full scrutiny because the hidden extras that are involved certainly add to inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Fine Gael is an advocate of consumer rights and we act as such inside and outside the House. We have a rip-off culture and cartel arrangements can exist between banks in certain areas. They believe it is acceptable to have an agreement by consensus on certain facilities and charges. Every charge a bank imposes on a person's account should be specified clearly so that he or she will be in no doubt about why it has been levied.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In June 2003, the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, asked four questions on this vital area, the first of which queried why only half the ECB rate cut of 2.75% from the past two and a half years had been passed on to business and personal borrowers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_376">That is a good question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_377">The European Central Bank is now setting the rate but the banks still have a means of varying their rates. When one considers the loaded charges on accounts and the extension of credit limits, one will note that the banks have caveats on every deal known such that very few customers can avail of the lowest-service deal. The system is designed in such a way that, if one manoeuvres by one day, one will automatically pay a higher rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The second question asked by Deputy Richard Bruton was why Ireland has the third highest mark-up between lending and deposit rates in the European Union. This is difficult to explain. The financial regulatory authority should examine the mark-up and deal with the banks decisively. We are now part of an enlarged Union and it is important that we be competitive in every sense. We all hear people making comparisons and asking why business is so expensive in the Republic of Ireland by comparison with Northern Ireland and why services are more expensive here than in other EU countries. One must remember that the critical stacked-up costs of doing business in Ireland, such as costs associated with banking, insurance and electricity, are not taken into account. The consumer must pay for all these charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Some banks make up to €1 billion per year — very much in a monopoly environment — and should be brought to task over all the hidden charges. The Minister issued his inflation report last week, which was good to see, but he cannot control these charges. We all hear talk about hairstylists' costs and certain other aspects of our rip-off culture, but the worst charges are the stacked-up costs of taking out a loan and opening a business. If the Minister dealt with the major bodies responsible for these stacked-up costs, the rates would decrease.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The third question asked by Deputy Richard Bruton was why financial charges for the consumer have increased by 23% in the 12 months up to the middle of 2002.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_382">The Central Bank is an autonomous body but at least the new authority will be accountable to the House. I hope the people the Minister will appoint to the advisory boards will have expertise in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Deputy Richard Bruton's fourth question was why the average interest rate on short-term loans to enterprises was more than three points higher than that in other EU countries. People think all businesses are ripping them off but the financial institutions are responsible and they must be regulated. No one minds if banks make healthy profits but we must get value for money. There is no reason businesses are paying rates of 23% and that the average interest rate on short-term loans to enterprise is 26%. It is an indictment of the financial institutions in one of the healthiest economies in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">There is an area of Government policy that the regulator should examine — the €40 charge for credit cards. People have to pay it twice if they decide to open a second credit card account. The Minister should re-examine the credit card tax.</p>

On the establishment of the European currency, direct control over interest and exchange rates was surrendered to the European Central Bank and by pooling sovereignty our economy benefited.

          <p eId="para_394">The auditing measures contained in the Bill are compatible with those required under the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. My party does not oppose those requirements, we want to ensure that Government is not just joined up but that there is an interlocking level of management of financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The inquiry into DIRT payments by the Public Accounts Committee found that tax evasion was accommodated by banks for the <i>crème de la crème</i> of the country but consumers now expect equality of treatment for all customers, value for money, interest rates the same as those in the rest of Europe and the same level of encouragement of enterprise. Comparing the level of the consumer spend and the value received in return, it must be acknowledged that the cost of doing business in this country is 10% higher than the rest of Europe and it is the consumer who must pay at the check out.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I thank all Members for their valuable contributions to this debate and I appreciate the support of all sides of the House for the establishment of a modern, consumer-focused regulatory system for the financial services sector. Before I address some of the points raised in the debate, I emphasise again two points I made in my speech. The greater part of this Bill arises from a public consultation process on the completion of the McDowell report on recommendations for a new architecture for financial services regulation in the State. I am also conscious of the need for consolidation of financial services legislation and, as a consequence, a consolidation Bill is now included in the Government's legislative programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I appreciate the gracious acknowledgement of Deputies of the IFSRA's performance in consumer protection. I acknowledge Deputy Richard Bruton's point about ensuring proper Oireachtas scrutiny of regulators, something we should consider further. I assure the Deputy that I intend to appoint robust consumer representatives to the council of the ombudsman because the culture of the ombudsman should be one of fairness and openness to consumers with grievances. On his comments on the industry panel and the dangers of regulatory capture, I assure him that the circumscribed powers of that panel arose from similar concerns expressed by the Competition Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Deputy Burton expressed concern about the composition of the panels. The Bill obliges me to consult not only my ministerial colleagues but also representative organisations of consumers and industry, respectively. On the issue of penalties, the Deputy expressed concern about the constitutional implications of my proposals. I will propose changes on Committee Stage, having consulted the Attorney General, to ensure that the provisions in the Bill are compatible with the prerogatives of the courts under our Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">On the auditing provisions, I assure Deputy Burton that the provisions in this Bill are add-ons to the requirements in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill which will give powers to the IFSRA to impose additional tailored requirements on financial institutions. These provisions will facilitate the IFSRA in laying down provisions for the corporate governance of financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The comments of Deputies Ó Caoláin, Finian McGrath, Connolly and Boyle reinforce the fact that the significant challenge faced by the financial regulator is to provide for a fair marketplace that benefits both personal and business consumers. They also underline the important investigative work being done by the Competition Authority in the financial services sector and with the Director of Corporate Enforcement in improving the overall standards of corporate governance in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Deputy Coveney made the point that the compliance statement from the IFSRA is at its discretion. It is intended to be complementary to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Deputy Michael D. Higgins comments underlined the difficult tasks faced by the new regulatory structures in defending consumer interests in an era of rapid technological change and development. The Deputy will agree that the terms and conditions apply to all loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I fully understand the vital role played by credit unions in serving the needs of local communities. Deputy Crawford can rest assured that credit unions fully understand the need to comply with EU rules and have been fully consulted on the amendments that will be brought forward on Committee Stage to achieve compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Deputy Gay Mitchell asked about the ombudsman's provisions. The Bill, as drafted, will allow a consumer access to the Irish Financial Services Ombudsman or the equivalent officer in another EU member state. On the Deputy's concerns about the potential failure to appear before the Oireachtas, it would be inconceivable that a ministerial appointee would refuse to comply with the statutory obligation to appear before an Oireachtas committee or that a Minister would not take action if that happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Deputy Eamon Ryan echoed the comments of other Deputies on the dangers of excessive lending, especially in the housing area. This is something on which the financial regulator and the Central Bank have been quite active. A second issue raised by Deputy Ryan was that of compensation for Irish customers of insurance companies regulated in another member state of the European Union which fail. This issue is being addressed at EU level on the basis of an Irish initiative reflecting our experience of the impact of the collapse of independent insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Deputy Kehoe echoed from his experience his concerns about the lending practices of financial institutions which illustrate the challenges facing the new regulatory structures. He also pointed out, and it is something on which I agree with him, that the credit unions play a vital role in supporting the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Deputy Durkan was concerned about the competitiveness of the financial services sector. This will be a focus for the new industrial panel. I also thank Deputy Perry for his pertinent comments in matters relating to the Bill. These issues have existed for some time, so I am anxious to progress the legislation. I look forward to an early continuation of this debate on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_411">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The purpose of this short Bill is to implement the recommendations of the constituency commission report of 2003 on changes to the European Parliament constituencies and to give effect to the European Council decision of 25 June and 23 September 2002 concerning the election of Members of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Bill has six sections. Section 1 defines the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to which I shall refer as the 1997 Act. Sections 2, 3 and 5 amend the 1997 Act to implement certain provisions of the European Council decision of 25 June and 23 September 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The 2002 Council decision updated a 1976 Act of the European Community concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage. Most of the changes made in the Council decision are textual and are already provided for in Irish legislation. The four changes requiring transposition into Irish law are: the specification of new categories of office holders who are not eligible for election to the European Parliament, namely, a member of the board of directors of the European Central Bank, the Ombudsman of the European Communities, a member of the Court of First Instance or an official of the European Central Bank; the ending of a dual mandate for a person who is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, although the Council decision, provides for a derogation for a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas elected to the European Parliament in June 2004 until the next general election to the Houses of the Oireachtas, when he or she will no longer be permitted to hold the two offices; a requirement that the results of the European elections may not be announced officially until the close of polling in the member state whose electors are the last to vote; and any reference in the 1997 Act and in other domestic legislation to a representative in the European Parliament should be construed as a reference to a Member of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I would like to set out briefly the background to the European Council decision of June and September 2002. The European treaty provided for a uniform electoral procedure to the European Parliament from the first direct elections in 1979. While the Parliament actively sought the introduction of such a procedure, unanimity was never forthcoming at Council level, mainly because of one member state's desire to maintain its first past the post electoral system.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Two developments in 1998 gave renewed impetus to harmonising the electoral procedure for European elections. First, the Amsterdam treaty relaxed the strict uniformity requirement. Article 138(3) of that treaty reads as follows: "The European Parliament shall draw up a proposal for elections by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member states or in accordance with principles common to all member states".</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Second, UK legislation was amended to provide for a non-preferential proportional representation list system for European elections. Some form of list system of proportional representation was used throughout the European Union in the 1999 European elections, except for Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Amsterdam treaty also authorised the European Parliament to draw up a proposal for a common procedure or common principles for European elections to supersede the 1976 Council Act on direct elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">In anticipation of the coming into force of the Amsterdam treaty, the European Parliament in July 1998 passed a resolution incorporating a draft Act to implement the revised Article 138(3). The draft Act was discussed from 1998 to 2002 in the general affairs group of the Council of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">There were some contentious points in the draft Act such as a proposal that a list system of proportional representation must be used. There was no problem with specifying PR in the Act as it is a principle common to all member states. However, there was a difficulty with the article specifying that a list system of PR be used. The Irish PR single transferable vote system is not a list system within the normal continental meaning of the expression so we secured a change to this article to accommodate our electoral system. This text provides for retention of our present electoral system, while allowing for an alternative, if such is decided in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">It was also proposed that the office of MEP shall be incompatible with the office of member of a national parliament. This proposal represented a complete change in policy as a dual mandate had previously been specifically provided for. In this regard, the explanatory statement which accompanied the European Parliament's report of 2 June 1998 stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_421">However, the development of Parliament's powers and responsibilities makes it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for the members to hold some other Office at the same time. In these circumstances, given the way in which the European Parliament's powers have evolved since 1976, it would now be appropriate to make the Office of MEP incompatible with that of member of a national parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Article 5 of the Council Act of 1976 permitted members of the European Parliament who are members of a national parliament to exercise a dual mandate. While 13 of the 15 Irish MEPs elected in 1979 exercised a dual mandate, only four of the 15 MEPs elected in 1994 had dual membership. Following the 1997 general election, no Irish MEP had a dual mandate. While two dual mandated MEPs were elected in Ireland in 1999, no Irish MEP currently holds a dual mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">In recent years, there has been a tendency for Members of the Irish Parliament elected to the European Parliament to opt for one or other mandate at the next subsequent general election. There has also been a progressive reduction in the number of national representatives exercising the dual mandate. In practice, therefore, the exercise of the dual mandate in Ireland has become limited in time and in number.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The previous Government negotiated a limited derogation to the elimination of the dual mandate. The Government has now decided that the limited derogation will apply on a once-off basis at the June 2004 elections. The ban on the dual mandate will fully apply from the next general election.</p>

     <b>Mr. Deasy</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
     if he has satisfied himself that the recent practice of Internet grooming is adequately covered by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998; if he has further satisfied himself that where a child, in the absence of coercion and of his or her own free will, meets with a predatory adult following Internet grooming, this is covered by the Act and constitutes an offence under the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_148">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_426">The definition of child pornography at section 2 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 includes any visual representation or description of, or information relating to, a child that indicates or implies that the he or she is available to be used for the purposes of sexual exploitation. That provision was included in the definition in order to deal with fears that paedophiles were exchanging information with one another on the Internet about such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_427">The particular issue of Internet grooming referred to in the question was not an issue at the time the 1998 Act was being prepared but has since given rise to concern. It would not be easy to deal with in legislation but I have been examining it in the context of legislation which will be required for compliance with two recent EU Framework Decisions to see if a practical and enforceable solution can be found. As part of the examination I have regard to a provision in the recently enacted Sexual Offences Act 2003 in the UK which makes it an offence to meet a child for the purpose of committing a sexual offence against him or her following grooming, whether on the Internet or otherwise.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_149">
            <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
            <p eId="para_428">I thank the Minister of State for his response, but there is a problem with the questioning system, which affects the Ceann Comhairle's office. I put down a couple of questions, one of which was a priority question to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the number of orders made under sections 3 and 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003. I also asked a question about how many prosecutions had been secured under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. These questions have not been allowed for different reasons and the figures are not available. One was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle's office.</p>
            <p eId="para_429">Last week the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform issued a statement with regard to the Garda crime statistics. It said the reductions in violence and public order offences follow the enactment during 2003 of the public order Bill and the intoxicating liquor Bill, which gives significant additional powers to the Garda to deal with public order and street crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_430">Somebody is misleading somebody else. A Department and a Minister make a statement with regard to two pieces of legislation but say they do not have the figures to back that up and will not provide a Deputy in this House with the figures. There is a massive fundamental contradiction here. This exposes entirely the sham procedure in this House. It has turned into an exercise in concealment, more than anything. Somebody will have to answer the question as to how a statement like that could be made a week ago, while at the same time questions that I have asked on the same pieces of legislation have been disallowed. It is extraordinary. The Ceann Comhairle, on a point of order, will have to answer that question.</p>
            <p eId="para_431">At the same time last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said that the spiral in crime had been curtailed. This is the same man who asked an expert group to look into the rate of unreported crime. The group has not reported to him, so how in God's name could it be said that the spiral of crime in this country has been curtailed? There is something fundamentally wrong with this process.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelTracey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_275">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
            <p eId="para_560">I wish to express my own regret and that of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, at the difficulties that Jetmagic is experiencing, and our concern both for the passengers and the staff of the airline.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Jetmagic is a Cork Airport based regional airline, which began operations in April 2003. The airline has been operating from Cork to a wide range of destinations in the UK and Europe and has 100 staff all based in Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">The airline announced earlier today that it is suspending operations on the recommendation of its board of directors. An extraordinary general meeting of shareholders will take place within the next week or so, to decide whether the company should be wound up. The airline has not actually closed as of yet, and if further financial backing can be found, it may be able to get back on its feet. The company has cited a lower than expected passenger demand, especially in business travel, as being the main reason for its cessation of operations. Competition from other carriers on some of its routes is also cited as impacting on the company's business forecast for 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">The airline has said that it has approximately 400 passengers who cannot now return to Ireland on Jetmagic flights. The airline has put a helpline in place, and any stranded passengers who call the number will be given details of alternative flights that they can arrange to get them home, although the airline is not in a position to fund those flights. Jetmagic is contacting airlines at airports it serves and is asking those airlines to help in getting people home.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">Passengers who have already booked and paid for flights will not be able to travel outwards. The airline is recommending that any passengers who have paid for tickets with credit cards should contact their credit card company for a refund and that any passengers with travel insurance should contact their insurance company. For any passengers who have not paid by credit card and who do not have insurance, Jetmagic has provided an address to which claims for refunds should be sent.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">Aer Lingus has offered that any Jetmagic passengers stranded abroad at any airport served by Aer Lingus, will be brought home by them for €50 per passenger, plus taxes. Passengers who are not at an airport served by Aer Lingus, but are able to make their way to such an airport, can avail of the same offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">European airlines operate under a package of European law, known as the "third air package", dating from 1992. Under this legislation, airlines are free to commence operations as long as they meet economic and safety criteria and to compete on any routes they wish without recourse to any authorities for approval. Governments are not permitted to subsidise or assist any airline company.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">In Ireland, economic regulation of the airline is carried out by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and safety regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Jetmagic commenced operations in April 2003, having obtained approval from both the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Irish Aviation Authority. The Commission for Aviation Regulation became aware towards the end of last year that Jetmagic was facing financial difficulties. The Commission for Aviation Regulation contacted the company regarding concerns it had about the financial situation and asked the company to improve its balance sheet position. Jetmagic recently confirmed to the Commission for Aviation Regulation that it had received additional investment from some of its shareholders. It is now clear that these additional funds were not sufficient for the ongoing viability of the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">The Deputy also raises the question of a review of the licensing of airlines. As it happens, the European Commission is currently carrying out a review of the third aviation package to see if the 1992 legislation requires updating. However, I am satisfied that the unfortunate collapse of Jetmagic is not due to any deficiency in the present licensing arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_569">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to provide that reply. The priority today is the plight of the 400 passengers abandoned at various airports. In his reply the Minister of State seems to wash his hands of any responsibility for those people. It is important that all possible steps are taken today to ensure those people can return home as quickly as possible. I note the reasonably generous offer made by Aer Lingus. Has the Department of Transport taken any steps to contact other airlines, to establish where the passengers are and the quickest and cheapest way to get them back home? Given the exceptional circumstances, I hope the Department will play a role in this.</p>

            <p eId="para_570">There is no such thing as washing our hands. We are bound by certain national and international legalities on this issue. The Department takes this matter seriously and has been in contact with the company since the latter part of last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_572">The Deputy should let me answer, as I did not interrupt her. The Commission for Aviation Regulation has also been in touch with the company. There has been constant communication between the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Department of Transport. Every effort is being made through all the possible avenues including the communication with the national carrier, Aer Lingus, whose generosity I acknowledge, to ensure that services and options are available as far as physically possible to return passengers to Ireland as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">With passengers in various locations it is not possible to make arrangements to return them all together. However, all organs of the State, including the Department of Transport, are and will be available to assist Irish citizens stranded anywhere.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_280">
            <from>Ms Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_574">It is regrettable that the Minister of State has not answered my question. I want to know whether his Department had taken any steps today to ensure people are brought home as quickly as possible. All his bluff, blunder and generalisation do not answer that question.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">I wish to ask about the more serious issue of the licensing system for airlines and the precise role of the Commission for Aviation Regulation in this regard. We are all familiar with the position that obtains in respect of travel agencies and have learned through difficult experiences. In the past various companies ran into difficulties and their passengers were stranded in various places or were left high and dry. As a result, a system of bonding for travel agencies was introduced. If we have a system that applies to travel agencies in respect of safeguarding the moneys of passengers and clients, a similar system should be put in place for airlines.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">With regard to the role played by the Commission for Aviation Regulation in granting licences to airlines, are conditions set down in respect of the financial situations of such airlines before they are licensed? Is there any requirement to lodge a bond to safeguard against situations of this nature and to protect the interests of passengers?</p>

            <p eId="para_577">The company in question only took this decision earlier today. We are in touch with the situation but we obviously cannot have duplication of effort because it would create confusion for the unfortunate passengers.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_283" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food">
            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_579">As stated earlier, a special helpline has been made available by Jetmagic. Communication has been made by the company with individual passengers, in so far as that can be done. The company has contacted these people's home addresses and, in co-operation with the Department of Transport, which is in touch with the situation, has tried to reach them by telephone. The Department, the Government or the Minister have not heard of any particular cases of hardship thus far. Every effort is being made on a professional basis to ensure that people experience a minimum of disruption and that they are returned to Ireland as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">As regards bonding, I was Minister of State with responsibility for aviation when we introduced bonding for travel agents. There is no requirement in European law either for travel agents or airlines. Ireland is the only country with that system for travel agencies, which was introduced as a result of difficulties experienced in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">As regards the licensing system for airlines, detailed criteria are laid down by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Department of Transport <i>vis-à-vis</i> the finances, guarantees and research which must be available and the requirements that must be met before an airline can be established and commence trading. Those criteria are extremely strict. We could obviously consider the issue of bonding. If Ireland was the only country to go down that road, it would be expensive. However, if a global approach could be taken, with support from the International Air Transport Authority or a similar organisation, it would help to ensure that a new instrument of support would be available to protect airlines and their staff, passengers and operations in the future. I am sure this matter will be considered by the Minister.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_284">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_582">Has any contact been made with other airlines servicing this country and the foreign airports involved to see if an arrangement similar to that with Aer Lingus could be put in place as a matter of goodwill to fly the 400 stranded passengers home?</p>
            <p eId="para_583">I met the management of Jetmagic a number of months ago. The company provided a high quality, regionally-based service and it is disappointing that it has encountered financial difficulties. One of the reasons for that was the cut-throat competition in the sector. In light of the comments made by the company and the previous example of the service provided by Go between Dublin and Edinburgh, does the Department intend to put measures in place to ensure that there will be fair and balanced competition?</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The Minister of State indicated that any company operating in this country must meet economic and safety criteria. It is clearly evident that the passengers are not part of the current aviation package. The Minister of State said that there is not a deficiency in the licensing system at present. In light of the Government's holding of the Presidency of the European Union, will he give consideration to ensuring that a bond system be put in place, particularly in respect of some of the other low cost carriers? With new enterprises commencing operations, passengers could be left stranded as is the case with Jetmagic.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_285" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food">
            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_585">As the Deputy is aware, from information recently available in the public arena, there have been certain difficulties whereby clubs and groups have come together to operate as travel companies or travel groups and have, to a degree, flouted the laws. I will ask the Minister for Transport to examine the situation to see if there is anything that can be done with regard to a bonding system on a European-wide level while we hold the Presidency. It is not a simple matter but we will do everything possible to ensure that protection is provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">I agree that competition is critical. We would not have the massive tourism product or the reduced cost in air travel, either on the island of Ireland or out of Ireland, were it not for the huge competition that exists. Jetmagic admits that there was tough competition on the routes on which it provided services. This eroded the cash returns it expected to make on those routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">As regards the Deputy's first question, the Department of Transport has been in contact with a number of airlines, including Aer Arann, the world's fastest growing regional airline, British Airways, CSA, a Czech airline, and Aer Lingus. All four have offered assistance to the stranded passengers. Every effort is being made by the staff of Jetmagic and officials of the Department of Transport to see what can be done to ensure that people experience the minimum amount of difficulty in returning to our country.</p>

            <p eId="para_588">It is a matter of regret for the staff of the company, its owners, who invested a great deal of money and have now lost it, and the people of Cork and Munster that Jetmagic has ceased operations. We would like the Government to do what it can to try to rescue some of the passengers affected by this situation and also to try to rescue some of the business that Munster will lose.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">It is ironic that the Minister for Transport, who has been spending so much time dealing with aviation policy with the supposed intention of improving the fortunes of Cork Airport, has not paid attention to this matter. He has been busy formulating his business plans, which no one understands and which have not been explained——</p>

            <p eId="para_591">——to split up the State airports. It is unfortunate that, rather than concentrating on that matter, which does not make much sense to people in the industry, he did not pay attention to what was happening at Cork Airport and stop throwing shapes about the structures of the three airports operated by Aer Rianta.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">Will the Minister of State indicate whether he believes the company faced fair competition on some of its routes? Some commentators have stated that what may have happened is that routes the company selected, especially for business or commuter services, were targeted by certain competitors who introduced services of their own to ensure that Jetmagic did not get off the ground and experienced difficulty attracting customers. Is the Minister for Transport concerned that such competitive practices were pursued in this case? What means does he have of governing the issuing of routes and the management of competition in this sector to ensure that a new operator such as Jetmagic has an opportunity to establish itself and to ensure that large existing operators, especially State companies, some of which are about to be privatised, do not use their monopoly position to compete unfairly and bring about the demise of such a fledgling airline? What measures did the Department put in place to ensure that such anti-competitive practices were not pursued in this instance?</p>

            <p eId="para_593">Deputy Eamon Ryan's statement about the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is disingenuous. It is also inconsistent with the statement he made earlier in connection with the situation regarding the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The Minister must have business plans and be committed to ensuring that, before decisions are made on any issue, certain criteria are fulfilled. It is the same in this situation with the licensing arrangement laid down for airlines.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">I am not an expert on airline travel so I cannot say whether the competition was unfair. That is a matter for the European Commission under European law. There have been no allegations of unfair competition. There have been statements from the company that there was strong competition on their routes. However, under European law, airlines are free to choose their routes and Governments in member states are precluded from investing in airlines. That is the reason there has been such change in the travel industry and why there are so many new companies in the business. It is also the reason that air travel has become much cheaper and mobility has increased, to the advantage of all economies.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">Will the Minister address the jobs issue? Every effort should be made by the Department to contact FÁS and other agencies involved in recruitment and employment to ensure the 100 people left behind by the company will be enabled to find alternative employment, preferably in the aviation industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">The other issue is the future of Cork Airport and what this collapse means for it. Other speakers have spoken about the absence of a business plan. The concern of Opposition Members is that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is proceeding on the basis of a hunch with breaking up Aer Rianta without having thought it through and without a clear business plan. That is the reason we and the consultants who recently advised the Government are concerned. The break-up of the Aer Rianta company calls into question the future viability of Cork and Shannon airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">In this case, a local company started at the airport with services on popular routes at competitive prices, yet it could not survive. What does that say for the Minister's claim that opening up the airports will facilitate the generation of extra business? After today's events one must ask if that business exists. One must also ask about competition and whether anti-competitive practices were followed by other airlines to squeeze out Jetmagic. Both elements had an impact but the latter was probably a stronger influence on what happened today.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Serious questions arise from the collapse of this company. Will the Minister of State relay to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, the concerns expressed by the Opposition? We do not seek answers today, within a few hours of the event, but expect the Minister, in light of his broader plans for Cork Airport, to examine closely the events leading to the collapse of Jetmagic. He should come to the House or to the Committee on Transport with a detailed report on what went wrong and why this fledgling company could not survive despite the goodwill that existed and the good deals Aer Rianta gave the company. Why could it not survive?</p>

            <p eId="para_599">The Government is most concerned about the loss of jobs but it is legally precluded from intervening in the situation until a special annual general meeting of the company takes place and the Department of Transport and other relevant State agencies are notified of the situation. Obviously, in the event of a negative conclusion at the annual general meeting, the Department of Transport will liaise with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other State agencies, including FÁS, to assist the victims of this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">I do not agree that there was an effort to squeeze out Jetmagic. Competition in the airline industry is tough. The objective of airline operators is to fill their planes to maximum capacity so they can achieve the maximum throughput and the best possible turnover. That leads to competition. There is no comparison between running an airline and running an airport. Aer Rianta is an airport management company; it is not an airline operator, an aviation authority——</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_296">
            <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_607">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The linked work experience programme is one of the most successful jobs and training schemes I have encountered. Unfortunately, in Dún Laoghaire it has been ended, apparently for budgetary reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">The linked work experience programme is operated in Dún Laoghaire by the Dún Laoghaire Community Workshop. Linked work experience provides work experience for young people between the ages of 16 and 25 years. Most of the young people concerned have left school early, many before the junior certificate. Most are from disadvantaged homes and many labour under a variety of social, educational and economic disadvantages. They are young people who find it difficult to get a start in life and some could end up in trouble with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">Under the linked work experience programme, the young person's needs are assessed by the programme co-ordinator who then tries to match them to an employer, helps the person with his or her CV and interview and follows up by providing back-up support from the training workshop while the person is with the employer. The employer, in turn, provides the young person with mentoring assistance. The young person spends six months in the training workshop and approximately six months on the job.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">The scheme is working successfully. Since the beginning of 2002, 90 young people in Dún Laoghaire have gone through this scheme. Of those, 60% were placed in employment or in appropriate training or education after they finished the programme. That is a high success rate. There are 52 local companies or employers involved in the scheme, most of whom are prepared to repeat the experience and to take more than one trainee. Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in danger of being left behind or getting into trouble are being channelled into useful employment. The employers are enthusiastic about the scheme, the Community training workshop is happy that it is working successfully and the trainees gain huge fulfilment from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">Shortly before Christmas, the community training workshop was told that the scheme is being discontinued. This information came from FÁS. I have seen two items of correspondence from FÁS and they are contradictory. The letter from the regional director states that the centre is operating with too high a number for the scheme while the letter from the director general of FÁS seems to imply that the centre does not have enough people on the scheme. When one reads both letters together, however, it is clear that the scheme was discontinued for financial reasons. FÁS simply pulled the plug on a successful scheme for its own financial reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Will the Minister ensure that FÁS reinstates this scheme? It is working well for young people who, in normal circumstances, would be lost to education, employment or getting a start in life. I met one employer who told me he had two of these people working for him. One of them was from a family in which, over three generations, nobody had worked and there was little family support for somebody leaving in the morning to go to a job. This scheme has managed to get these young people into employment, employers and operators are happy with it and the trainees are more than fulfilled with it. It astonishes me that when something is working and is a success, we manage to pull the plug on it. Over the next number of years people will organise seminars, produce reports and wonder about what can be done for the young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who are dropping out of school, finding it difficult to get employment and who are sometimes getting into trouble. This scheme is working successfully in my area. I want it back in the interests of the trainees, their families and the communities in which these young people live. I ask the Minister of State to intervene with FÁS to ensure this working worthwhile scheme is restored.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
            <p eId="para_613">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I will outline briefly the respective roles which FÁS and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, play in training and employment schemes. The Minister of State's role is to agree public funding and give overall policy direction to FÁS. The Minister of State does not have a role in the ongoing operational management of FÁS schemes or in deciding how funding should be allocated to individual project or participants. Such decisions are day-to-day operational matters for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act 1987. However, in light of the Deputy's concerns, the Minister of State has asked FÁS to comment on its dealings with the Dún Laoghaire community training workshop.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">Community training workshops are small training centres that run a range of community-based training programmes to meet the needs of early school leavers in their area. The workshops are autonomous bodies under the control of management committees drawn from different sectors of the community. These committees employ staff to run the workshops and are responsible for the policy and administration of the centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">FÁS assists more than 40 of these workshops nationwide by meeting staff salaries and paying allowances to the centres' trainees. In return, FÁS will negotiate a contract with each workshop, while agreeing the level of training to be provided that year. The training provided by these workshops has two elements. Formal training within the workshops is provided at foundation level. This mixes practical skills, such as catering or woodwork, with personal development courses and leads to FÁS or City and Guilds certification, junior certificate or applied leaving certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">Towards the end of their training period, community workshop trainees are job ready and can participate in the linked work experience part of the FÁS community training workshop programme. This takes place in local companies and runs for a period of approximately four to ten weeks, during which FÁS continues to pay the participant the same training allowance he or she received while in the workshop. The objective is to give valuable work experience to the graduate and hopefully a permanent job placement in the company. In agreeing work programmes with the workshops, FÁS is guided by the needs of early school leavers and young people who need basic qualifications to obtain employment. FÁS, therefore, requires young people to obtain the basic qualification before they take up in-company training.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">I understand the Dún Laoghaire community training workshop has been in operation for more than 15 years and has run a range of programmes covering literacy and numeracy, pre-apprenticeship, craft skills, catering and computer skills. However, FÁS has become concerned that a significant number of participants on the linked work experience module in Dún Laoghaire have not received training or a basic qualification in the workshop, but instead have been going directly into employment.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_313">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_633">I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to discuss the increasingly serious problem of gross overcrowding, inadequate and dilapidated buildings and the clear breaches of health and safety regulations arising therefrom which negatively affect conditions under which pupils and teachers try to work and study in a number of primary and second level schools in County Kildare. I call on the Minister for Education and Science to provide the necessary resources to address these pressing issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">County Kildare is adjacent to the greater Dublin population area. There is ongoing pressure for school places and utility and community services. Schools, hospitals and other essential services are to the fore in that regard. Virtually every town and village which has or does not have a primary and/or second level school, is under serious pressure to provide urgently required facilities for an increasing population.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">I do not propose to name all the schools in County Kildare, but the Maynooth post-primary school, which has been understaffed for several years, is heavily overcrowded. It is currently restricting admissions. Its students and teachers work and study in conditions which are more suited to the 18th or 19th century, rather than the 21st century. The school is at the early architectural planning stage. Planning permission was granted three years ago. The community has taken all the necessary action, but the relevant action has not been taken by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">I ask the Minister to give priority rating to all schools in the county. A number of schools, such as Sallins and Robertstown, which were in a serious condition, have received indications. Work will proceed on those in the current year, but it remains to be seen to what extent that will happen. However, work must be carried out on Maynooth post-primary school, Scoil Clochar Naofa in Kilcock and Tír Mochain national school, to name but a few. Kill national school requires a new building. Discussions have taken place. The Minister said in reply to parliamentary questions that consideration was being given to the acquisition of a site. However, while that has been happening for the past two years, new road proposals have been outlined which will bring heavy vehicular traffic close to the school. It would be better to relocate the school to another site as quickly as possible in view of the impending major road reconstruction work. St. Patrick's post-primary school in Naas is another example. I will not list all the schools because there are a total of 46.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">In view of the severe pressure emanating from the increased population and demand for school places, will the Minister influence the Department to draw up a priority list which takes cognisance of the geographic location of County Kildare, particularly north Kildare, to the population base of Dublin? If the schools in question have to take the population overflow from the capital city, which they are doing and are willing to do, the least that can be done is to ensure that the necessary resources are provided in a structured way to meet the requirements. If that is not done, the problem will get worse. If that happens, the Minister will leave himself open to allegations that he failed to do his duty and to meet his statutory requirements. Those allegations will be valid because we have repeatedly brought this to the attention of the Minister and his Department. The Minister of State is too good at his job to refer to the website. We all know about the website. I do not want to hear about it. I want action soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who has EU Presidency responsibilities this afternoon and regrets very much that he cannot be here.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Given the generalised nature of the Deputy's statement, I propose to outline to the House both the extensive actions already taken by the Department of Education and Science, and those planned for the future to address the accommodation needs of schools in County Kildare which continues to experience a population growth. This position almost inevitably places strain on existing educational infrastructure. Over the past two years, however, the Department of Education and Science has provided a massive and unprecedented €69.3 million for an extensive catalogue of capital interventions in primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare to address this issue, one of the biggest in Ireland. At primary level, the landscape in Kildare now includes two new schools at Celbridge and Killashee. A state-of-the-art, 16 classroom school with a double autistic unit is scheduled to go to construction in Naas this year together with a new eight classroom school in Rathmore, which represents very positive progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">Major extension and refurbishment works will also proceed for schools in Sallins, Clogherincoe and Celbridge. In addition, refurbishment works and the provision of ancillary accommodation are already under way at Scoil Naomh Mhuire, Ballymany. To further develop provision in the area, there are a number of primary school projects in architectural planning for extension and refurbishment works. The details of these projects are available on the school building programme for 2004 which is published on the Department of Education and Science's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">The Department of Education and Science is continually looking at new and innovative ways of expediting and devolving delivery of educational infrastructure. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware of two pilot initiatives being run by the Department — the small and rural school programme and the permanent accommodation programme. These initiatives are very promising and the Minister for Education and Science has decided to extend the schemes to include more schools for 2004. Included in these schools are the Monasterevin No. 2 national school and Scoil Naomh Brighde, Ticknevin. Both of these schools have accepted an invitation to participate and attended a meeting about this recently. Scoil Naomh an Chloch Mhor, Rathvilly, has also accepted an invitation for the construction of ancillary accommodation in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">Further additional accommodation was provided in Kildare in 2003 by way of purchased temporary accommodation for six primary schools. Officials in the Department of Education and Science are assessing and prioritising all applications for temporary accommodation for primary and post-primary schools for 2004. The Department will soon publish a list of projects proceeding this year. At post-primary level, in Naas, a major extension project has been completed at St. Mary's College, which has increased capacity at the school to 800 pupils. An application for further additional accommodation is being assessed. In addition, a major extension at Meánscoil Iognaid Rís is in architectural planning. There is surplus capacity at St. Patrick's post-primary school and the school's management authority, County Kildare VEC, is assessing the future of the school at its existing location. Elsewhere in the county, a physical education hall has recently been completed at Scoil Eoin, Rathstewart, and a large extension of almost 1,900 sq. m. is under construction at Scoil Dara, Kilcock.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">There are several post-primary projects in architectural planning for extension and refurbishment works. The details of these projects are also available on the Department of Education and Science's website. On the recent publication of the Department's building programme, the Minister stressed his absolute conviction that devolving funding, responsibility and authority to schools for small-scale capital building projects is the way forward. As a further initiative in that direction, the Minister has put in place a new €31 million devolved summer works scheme. This caters for necessary small-scale works that can be planned and delivered generally during the summer holidays when the children and teachers are at home. The 2004 programme will be updated in early spring to provide details of schools with approved projects under this scheme. This initiative sets clear dates for both the application and decision processes. Too often in the past a project could not progress during the summer because of difficulties caused by late notification. The new approach will bring greater clarity and certainty to the operation of the small-scale works programme and will help schools in their preparations for the execution of the works during the summer. The scheme is open to all primary and post-primary schools in the country and schools in Kildare may further benefit from funding under the scheme, subject to the prioritisation criteria governing the scheme, the level of funding available and the competing priorities for that funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">School authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. Primary schools are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues connected with the school infrastructure. In addition, the Department of Education and Science has set aside a contingency sum of €11 million to deal with emergency works in primary and post-primary schools, including emergency health and safety works, during 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">A key part of our strategy on capital expenditure will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multiannual allocations for capital investment in education projects covering the years 2004-08. All projects not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme are being reappraised with a view to including them as part of a multiannual building programme from 2005 onwards. These projects will also be reviewed in the context of a re-examination of the criteria governing the prioritisation of large-scale works in consultation with the education partners. The purpose of this review is to ensure that the criteria have optimum precision and are fully tuned to meeting the priority accommodation needs of the primary and post-primary sectors. When the review has been completed, a further list of priority projects will be approved to proceed through architectural planning this year. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, expects to be in a position to make a further announcement on these matters during 2004 and is very positive about that. Overall, the ongoing unprecedented level of investment in schools in County Kildare demonstrates the Department of Education and Science's commitment to ensuring that the long-term accommodation needs of the area are met. The Government's record in this regard is second to none.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_317">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_648">It is timely that I have this opportunity to bring the House up to date on developments in relation to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">The talks at the Labour Relations Commission have been protracted and difficult. Some progress was made initially but I regret to say that an impasse on one aspect of the talks has emerged leading to talks being adjourned yesterday until further notice to allow the sides to reflect on how to overcome the present difficulties. In the course of the talks and again following the impasse reached yesterday, the Labour Relations Commission advised against the sides taking public positions on aspects of the talks which might prejudice the prospects of a successful outcome to such further discussions which will inevitably arise in the future. This is a long standing industrial relations practice which has served practitioners well over the years. I am disappointed that the POA has not adopted this approach of maintaining confidentiality around the talks.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">In the light of statements issued by the POA in the last 24 hours and in view of the contents of two bulletins issued by it to its members in the course of the recent negotiations which have come to my attention, I must now reluctantly take this opportunity to set the record straight on some of the misleading statements made about matters under negotiation at the LRC. I do so reluctantly and will confine my remarks to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">The POA contention that the Irish Prison Service deliberately collapsed the talks at the LRC is patently untrue. While the talks reached an impasse, management was prepared and is still prepared to explore options for overcoming the particular difficulty involved. Furthermore, management made itself available to continue talks on other issues on the agenda pending reflection by both sides on how to resolve the issue at impasse.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">The impasse which has now emerged is not as the POA suggests related to management wanting staff to be available on stand-by to work additional hours without pay. In fact management has proposed an attendance system aimed at promoting 'smart' working which would involve staff contracting to work a fixed number of additional hours per year which would be paid for at a premium rate of 1.8 times the relevant hourly basic rate whether or not they are required to be worked.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">As regards the closure of prisons, Deputy Costello will already be aware of the terms of the Government decision of 11 November 2003 and the budgetary context in which it was taken. That decision approved a series of measures to be taken in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on a change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Irish Prison Service. These measures included the mothballing of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel Prisons and the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into post-release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. The reasons for the Government decision have been well aired in the House and indeed in the Seanad. I refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debates in this House on 12, 18 and 27 November 2003 and to an Adjournment debate in the Seanad on 19 November 2003. It was made clear that the Irish Prison Service could not continue to spend public money to feed an overtime culture which was virtually out of control while sustaining outdated and inefficient work practices. It was made clear that I had no desire to close or mothball prisons and that my preference was for a mutually advantageous agreement with the Prison Officers' Association which would ensure an efficient and cost effective prison service. I would still prefer an agreed way forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">Deputy Costello's suggestion that four of the most efficient prisons in the State have been selected for closure does not reflect the full facts. For example, Fort Mitchel is one of the most expensive prisons in the State with an annual cost per prisoner in excess of €100,000. The Curragh Place of Detention, which has already been mothballed, was less expensive at €72,000 per prisoner per annum but it has been possible to move the inmates and staff to a modern facility at the Midlands Prison which also operates at a cost of approximately €72,000 per prisoner per annum. Furthermore, the facilities at the Curragh are in a very poor state of repair with major capital investment required to put it to rights. As regards the open centres, the position is that the cost of keeping an offender in Shelton Abbey is well above the average at €85,000 approximately while Loughan House operates at a relatively modest €63,000 per prisoner per annum approximately. It should be borne in mind, however, that staffing costs in these institutions are extremely high compared with the staffing costs that could be expected if they were transformed to be run as a post release centre by another agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">In relation to the payment of mileage, prison officers transferring on a temporary basis are entitled to be paid mileage in accordance with the relevant Civil Service circular, i.e. where an officer proceeds on an official journey direct from home or returns home direct, the travelling allowance payable will be calculated by reference to the distance from home or headquarters to the temporary location, whichever is the lesser and will be paid at the reduced rate. As the amount payable is largely dependent on individual circumstances, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the annual cost at this time, pending receipt of individual claims from the officers concerned. It should be remembered, however, that any mileage payments which may be made will have to be reviewed should transferred staff be permanently assigned at the new location. Furthermore, any costs arising from mileage payments will be more than offset by savings in overtime.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">As regards the question of privatising sections of the prison system, the position is that, in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association, steps will be taken to give effect to that element of the Government decision of 11 November 2003 which envisages the invitation of tenders from contractors for the provision of a prisoner escort service. A prior indicative notice has already been published in the EU Official Journal in that regard. Prisoner escorts currently account for over one quarter of the overtime worked in the Irish Prison Service — that is €15 million approximately — and there is a great deal of room for rationalisation and efficiencies. Furthermore, I will be bringing forward legislation shortly to provide the necessary statutory authority to facilitate this arrangement. If agreement is reached with the POA the privatisation of prisoner escorts will not proceed. Instead, the system will be rationalised from within through the establishment of a dedicated prison service escort corps. While I have no immediate plans to privatise any other sections of the prison service, I am aware that the Irish Prison Service already outsources a number of services, including certain specialist maintenance services. The whole area of maintenance is under review and consultants have been engaged to advise on how best to provide for such needs. I am currently awaiting the outcome of this review and management's recommendations arising.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">The financial provision of €30 million in the 2005-2006 EU budget period is intended to fund a framework preparatory action to support a series of pilot programmes, including joint flights and reintegration measures, aimed at increasing the number of returns of persons illegally resident in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">The fund is a further development of the Comprehensive Return Action Programme which was approved by the Justice and Home Affairs, JHA, Council on 28 November 2002. This sets out a series of proposals for the development of a number of short, medium and long-term measures in the field of return. Considerable progress has been made in adopting these initiatives and this will be continued under the Irish Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The fund was first announced by the European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, JHA, Mr. António Vitorino, on Thursday, 22 January 2004, at the informal meeting of JHA Council of Ministers held in Dublin Castle. The precise details of the framework preparatory action, that is how it will be allocated to specific areas or projects of return and the procedures involved, will be a matter for negotiation in the relevant working group in Brussels chaired by the Irish Presidency. It is Ireland's aim to progress negotiations on this framework preparatory action so that Council conclusions on the matter can be reached before the end of the Irish Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">It should be noted that the fund is not intended to replace national programmes of return but rather to augment them and provide value added for the EU as a whole.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_319">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_663">As has already been made clear the Minister will be introducing significant changes affecting the Garda Síochána in the forthcoming Garda Síochána Bill. Preliminary details of these proposals in the form of a draft general scheme of a Bill were published and views on the proposals invited. I understand that Sinn Féin has made a submission on the proposals in the context of that consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">As regards the Patten commission, the Report of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, published in September 1999, has been given detailed consideration and where appropriate its work has been taken into account in preparing the Garda Síochána Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">However, I would enter the caveat that the Patten commission itself made it clear in its report that its recommendations were what it believed "would be the best arrangements for policing in Northern Ireland" and that the "problems faced by the police service in Northern Ireland are in a sense unique to a divided society with its own political history and culture".</p>
            <p eId="para_666">I would also point out that it looked at structures in the context of the policing structures in the United Kingdom where there are more than 40 different police services associated with specific local authority areas. We, in contrast, have a national police service as do many member states of the European Union, particularly the Scandinavian states.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">As regards a Garda Ombudsman, the Garda Síochána Bill to which I have referred will provide for the establishment of a fully independent Ombudsman body which will have wide powers to investigate complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána. The new body will also be able to investigate policies and practices of the Garda Síochána where such policies and practices may be the cause of complaint.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">On the question of the establishment of a policing board the position is that this issue has been raised on a number of occasions, but the Minister is not convinced that such a board would be the most appropriate model for this jurisdiction and the proposed Garda Bill will make no provision in that regard. In this State we have one national police force which is answerable, through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to the Dáil. The introduction of a Garda policing board would introduce a further level of bureaucracy into the process and effectively diminish the supervisory role of the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">As regards district-level partnerships and local accountability, there will be provision in the proposed Bill for the involvement of local authorities and local communities in local policing issues. However, it is not proposed to make the Garda Síochána in any way accountable to any body or group other than the Minister and the democratically elected members of Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_320">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_671">I want to dispel any belief that there is a major security issue in this area. In this context I would like to refer the Deputy to Question No. 403 answered on 18 November 2003 which gives background material on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">It is important to note that the vast majority of prisoners who have actually become unlawfully at large over the years are persons who absconded from one of the open prisons or who failed to return from a period of temporary release, but a large number are actually people who were released, perhaps only a matter of weeks before the end of a sentence, and who failed to sign on at the prison every week — one of the conditions of the release. In most of these cases, the offender is very much at the lower end of the risk to the public spectrum. The gardaí are informed where prisoners are unlawfully at large and have the power to detain, arrest, and return such persons to prison. It is also the case that, as the vast majority of persons on this list were nearing the end of their sentences they would, in the absence of them being at large, now have been released back into the community in any case.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">Over the years, a substantial number of prisoners have failed to comply with the requirement to sign on at the prison. However, the vast majority of prisoners who have failed to comply with the condition of their temporary release have not come to notice in respect of any further offences. The list of people currently shown as "unlawfully at large", which amounts to 666, would include many such people. As reported previously, the lists are subject to an ongoing examination to check their accuracy and it is anticipated that this process, when completed, will lead to a more realistic and significantly reduced figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">To put this in context, the number of prisoners who escaped from closed prison custody and who are still at large is negligible and no major criminal figures are involved. No prisoner escaped from a closed prison in 2003. Three prisoners absconded from a trustee area of the Dóchas Centre for a brief period and were quickly recaptured.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">I would also like to highlight the fact that the construction of additional prison spaces has significantly reduced the number of persons released on unstructured periods of temporary release. This has had a knock-on effect on the numbers at large as a significant proportion of those on the unlawfully at large list are a hangover from the revolving door syndrome which was prevalent in the 1990s. It is worth recording at this stage that similar lists from 1997 indicated that there were upwards of 1500 prisoners "at large" at any one time.</p>

            <p eId="para_679">As the Deputies will appreciate, under the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the management of the courts. The issue of security arrangements within the courts, including arrangements concerning juries, is a matter, in the first instance, for the Courts Service to consider. In this regard, I am advised by the Courts Service that it is currently in the process of producing guidelines for jury keepers. I am further advised that the Courts Service hopes to be in a position to finalise the guidelines in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">In so far as the Garda authorities are concerned, I have been informed that, while the Commissioner has not issued any specific guidelines to gardaí who act as jury keepers, the Garda Síochána discipline regulations are there to deal with any matters relating to misconduct involving a member of the Garda Síochána employed as jury keeper. Indeed, these regulations were applied in a recent case.</p>

            <p eId="para_682">The average number of prisoners in custody in 1994 was 2,141. This figure had risen to 3,112 in 2002. The number of persons in prison custody on 27 January 2004 was 3,168. The total annual number of committals to prison custody by the courts has risen by 15%, from 10,153 to 11,860, during the years 1994 to 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">As the Deputy is no doubt aware the 1990s, in a prison context, was blighted by a persistent high level of overcrowding in our committal institutions which resulted in the granting of release in an unstructured manner to many offenders at an early stage in their sentences. This situation was in serious danger of undermining the credibility of our whole system of criminal justice as the prison capacity available was totally insufficient to accommodate those sent there from the courts. As a result, almost 20% of those persons under sentence were out on temporary release. The construction of a large number of prison spaces in recent years has created a situation whereby the Irish Prison Service is now in a much better position to accommodate prisoners for the duration of their sentences.</p>

            <p eId="para_685">As you will be aware, the Probation and Welfare Service office which covers the Clare area was understaffed for some time due to the prolonged absence on sick leave of one of the staff. The office has a full complement of staff at present and is endeavouring to deal with the backlog of cases which have arisen along with new cases coming on stream. The Probation and Welfare Service has advised me that there has been a significant increase in the level of referrals from the courts in County Clare as well as in Limerick city and county.</p>

As can be seen from the figures provided the cost of purchasing ministerial cars each year is somewhere between €500,000 and €600,000 per annum except for 2003 when €367,829.97 was spent. It is expected that expenditure on ministerial cars in 2004 will be in excess of previous years figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The provision of the garda drivers, cars, fuel, maintenance and depreciation of the vehicles are the key components of cost to the Exchequer in providing State cars.

            <p eId="para_708">I have been informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel that as at 27 January 2004, there are 85 juvenile liaison officers, JLO gardaí and eight JLO sergeants working in the various divisions throughout the country. In addition to this, the national juvenile office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors, two sergeants and four civilians.

            <p eId="para_712">Section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to revoke a certificate of naturalisation in a number of specified circumstances. Those circumstances include cases where the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances; the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State; the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country; and the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act other than marriage acquired another citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">Before revoking a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister must give notice to the person to whom the certificate was granted of his intention, stating the grounds therefor and the right of that person to apply to him for an inquiry as to the reasons for the revocation. If the person in question makes such a request, the Minister is obliged to appoint a committee of inquiry consisting of a chairman having judicial experience and such other person as he may think fit, and refer the case to it. Thereafter the committee must report its findings to the Minister with a view to informing his decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">It is clear therefore that the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation is a serious matter and one in which the Minister must be in a position to show that the legal requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">It has never been the practice to comment on the detail of individual cases and I do not intend to depart from that practice. If the Deputy, or indeed any Member of this House, is aware of any particular cases where the exercise of my power under section 19 may be appropriate, relevant details should be passed to the Minister for investigation by the gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">Details of several recipients of certificates of naturalisation under the investment based scheme were referred to the gardaí a number of years ago for investigation but, following consideration of the reports of the investigations, it was concluded that there were insufficient grounds to justify invoking section 19 at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">The Deputy can be assured that if the circumstances of any particular case warrant revocation under the above provisions, I will have no hesitation in utilising my statutory powers to the fullest extent possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_719">The powers in question are contained in section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.

            <p eId="para_721">In order to avoid any later challenge to regulations made under section 22 on the grounds that proper procedures had not been followed, I intend to notify the European Commission of proposed regulations in accordance with the so-called technical standards or transparency directives, Directives 98/34/EC and 98/48/EC. These directives have been put in place at EU level in order to give the European Commission and the member states an opportunity to examine, in advance, proposed national standards and rules in the interests of transparency and the smooth functioning of the internal market.

            <p eId="para_724">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 53 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">The meeting between the Government and the European Commission on 6 January took the form of bilateral meetings between the Irish Ministers with responsibility for chairing meetings of the Council and their counterparts on the European Commission. This was followed by a plenary session. My meeting with Commissioner Vitorino focused on the Irish Presidency programme for the Justice and Home Affairs Council. I also made a short presentation on that programme, and the outcome of my discussions with Commissioner Vitorino, at the plenary session.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">On 22 and 23 January I hosted an informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Dublin Castle. The main purpose of such meetings is to allow joint consideration and an open exchange of views on topics of general scope. Meetings of this nature are not formal Council meetings and they do not arrive at formal conclusions or decisions. The Deputy will therefore understand that I am not in a position to detail the discussions which took place. However, I am more than happy to outline the matters under discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The informal Council took place over a day and a half. On each day there were sessions dealing with individual topics which were organised around Presidency discussion papers which outlined the issues and posed questions for consideration. Over the course of the informal Council, Ministers discussed a range of issues — the question of a common EU returns policy, the draft Council directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status, organised crime, a European Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on the European evidence warrant and, in the context of civil law cooperation, the possibility of an EU instrument to deal with small claims. In addition, at my invitation, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, addressed the Council and provided a UNHCR perspective on refugee protection issues including progress in relation to the development of a common EU asylum policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Deputy Seán Ryan has specifically asked about the proposed asylum procedures directive, discussions on which have not yet been finalised at EU level. The informal Council discussion was essentially an orientation debate on one important aspect of that directive namely, the safe third country concept. The directive, which is one of the central measures which was mandated by the Amsterdam treaty and by the Tampere European Council, aims to set out minimum standards for the granting and withdrawing of refugee status in member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">The European Council, on 12 December 2003, welcomed the significant progress achieved in the negotiations on the adoption of this directive. While taking note of the persisting political obstacles that have been delaying the conclusion of negotiations, it reaffirmed the importance of developing a common European policy on asylum and invited the Justice and Home Affairs Council to complete its work as soon as possible to ensure that the first phase of the establishment of a European asylum system is fully implemented within the deadline set in Tampere.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The discussion at the informal Council on the safe third country concept was helpful in providing guidance on how to bring forward dialogue on this measure. There was an emphasis on the need for flexibility and a general consensus that safe third countries should be part of the directive. The Presidency now intends to reflect on these discussions and to bring forward a new text to reflect their outcome as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">Deputy Ó Snodaigh also asked about the discussions on migration issues. These discussions focused on the practical implementation of various measures which have already been adopted at EU level in relation to the return of illegal immigrants. The discussions were aimed at providing the Presidency with a basis for progressing the practical implementation of return-related measures and were consistent with the Presidency focus in the JHA area on operational co-operation. Ministers had a positive exchange which identified practical ways to move forward on the implementation of a common return policy at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">The Garda Síochána is ever vigilant to ensure that any allegations relating to the trafficking of women for purposes including prostitution are vigorously investigated. "Operation Quest" was set up under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region, to target human trafficking-exploitation and associated crime in relation to lap dance clubs in Dublin. The operation consists of members from local detective units working alongside members from the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Criminal Assets Bureau. This investigation is on-going and, where appropriate, files will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">In view of the exponential growth in the level of immigration in Ireland over the past number of years, all members of the Garda Síochána are now being advised of the need to be mindful of the possibility of trafficking in women for purposes such as prostitution. Any cases where evidence of trafficking for purposes such as prostitution is disclosed will be fully investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">Of its nature it is impossible to be precise about the extent, in Ireland of persons being trafficked for the purposes of prostitution or sexual exploitation, but I am very conscious of the growing problem of trafficking in human beings particularly throughout the European Union. That is why I am actively pursuing, for example the transposition into Irish law of the EU Framework Decision on Trafficking in Human Beings; the ratification of the UN Transnational Crime Convention with its Protocol on Trafficking in Human Beings; and the EU Council Framework Decision on Joint Investigation Teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">The Garda authorities report that since the enactment of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 there have been nine cases of trafficking investigated by the Garda National Immigration Bureau where sexual exploitation has been disclosed as the motive.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Finally, I also provided grant funding in 2003 to Ireland En-Route, a forum made up of statutory organisations and voluntary groups set up in 2000 to investigate and address the problem of trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation. This forum is currently conducting research into the extent of the problem in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_740">Civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by gardaí in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against the Garda Síochána is in relation to assault and unlawful arrest. The great majority of these cases have been settled for less than €25,500. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State Counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which result in successful claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí are examined with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda Síochána discipline regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual gardaí come into question. It is relevant also to indicate here that I will shortly be publishing a Garda Síochána Bill, the draft scheme of which was approved by Government and published in July 2003, one of the principal aims of which will be the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána which will secure public confidence and which will address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.</p>

     <b>Mr. Durkan</b>
      asked the

     the number of prison spaces currently required; if he expects to have adequate spaces in the wake of the closure of the Curragh and Spike Island prisons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_802">The number of spaces required at any given time will clearly depend on the level of crime and the number and duration of sentences imposed by our courts and peaks and valleys will be experienced. As such, a definitive figure is not possible. However, given that crime figures have stabilised and are indeed reducing and that the numbers committed to the prisons from the court system are fairly static, there is no evidence of any strong underlying trend which would suggest a major increase in capacity is warranted. The number in custody on 27 January was 3,168 as against 3,186 for the corresponding date in 2003. However, that is not to say that there are no accommodation issues in the system. For example, some additional accommodation will be required for female prisoners. There is also an urgent acknowledged need to refurbish older facilities to provide both better accommodation and to reduce the usage of multiple occupancy cells.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">With regard to the closure of Fort Mitchel and the Curragh, I want to put these matters in their proper context. At the start of this year, the Curragh Place of Detention had capacity for 102 prisoners in 52 cells. Following the closure of the institution, the vast majority of its prisoners were accommodated in single cells in an unused block of the modern Midlands Prison. Approximately 80 prisoners were transferred in this way. As such the closure was largely neutral in its effect. Spaces had been available in the Midlands Prison for some time but, until now, it had not been possible to bring this into operation due to lack of available staff under existing rostering arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">Fort Mitchel Place of Detention also has a maximum capacity of 102 prisoners with many housed in multiple occupancy cells. The prisoners currently housed there are also being transferred to other prisons. The newly-built block in Limerick Prison has room for up to 100 prisoners and will shortly come into commission. Its opening will offset the loss in capacity as a result of the forthcoming mothballing of Fort Mitchel.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">The overall position is that closure results in a combined reduction of 204 prison spaces which is largely offset by the opening up of new accommodation in Limerick, 100, and the midlands, approximately 80. The net effect will be to reduce the overall capacity in the system by approximately 25 spaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">I do not take any reduction in prison capacity lightly and, in an ideal world, we would not have to close Fort Mitchel and the Curragh. We would, on the contrary, be developing new, modern facilities to the highest international standard and providing the long overdue refurbishment of some older institutions. However, we are not in this ideal world and it is frustrating in the extreme to see the money earmarked for these necessary capital projects being devoured by an overtime system which has spiralled out of control. The Government has now called time on this abuse of public money and the House will be aware of the measures which are being implemented to protect the financial future of the prisons and our future investment in the prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">In this regard, the Government is committed under its agreed programme to continue with the modernisation of prisons and to the provision of sufficient places so as to avoid serious overcrowding in the future. A review of prison space requirements and a new capital building programme to meet the requirements for the next ten to 15 years is under way. I hope to bring these proposals to Government in the near future.</p>

      asked the

     the Government's plans to meet its commitments under international law to allow asylum seekers access to the asylum system.
     [2522/04]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_332">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_809">The State fully meets its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and has a comprehensive legislative and infrastructural framework in place for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">The Refugee Act 1996 provides a comprehensive statutory framework for the processing of asylum applications. Section 8 of the Refugee Act provides, <i> inter alia</i>, an entitlement for an asylum seeker to apply for a declaration of refugee status. Section 9 of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that an applicant for asylum be allowed to enter and remain in the State until an asylum application has been considered. This legislative framework compares very favourably with legislative provisions internationally and was drafted in full consultation with the UNHCR.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Asylum applications in Ireland are processed in accordance with procedures agreed with the UNHCR and are based on the highest standards of international practice. Our asylum determination system compares with the best in the world in terms of fairness, decision making, determination structures and support services for asylum seekers. Three separate offices, namely, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Reception and Integration Agency have been put in place and highly resourced to deal with all aspects of asylum applications from initial application to appeal and to co-ordinate accommodation and other support needs of asylum seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">In addition, staff working in the asylum processing agencies are provided with comprehensive training overseen by UNHCR including dealing with vulnerable groups, such as victims of torture and unaccompanied minors, and comprehensive translation and interpretation services are provided to applicants as well as legal assistance at all stages of the asylum process. The provision of services to asylum seekers represents a considerable cost to the Exchequer and, for example, amounted to some €340 million in 2002. A figure for expenditure on asylum services in 2003 is being compiled at present. In 2004, the Department has provided some €120 million for asylum and related immigration services, including processing of asylum applications and accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">I understand that what prompted the Deputy to table this question was the recent discussion at the informal meeting of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council in Dublin on 22 and 23 January 2003 on the draft asylum procedures directive, with particular reference to comments made by Amnesty International. The informal Council discussion was essentially an orientation debate on one important aspect of that directive, namely, the safe third country concept. The Council discussions were helpful in providing guidance on how to bring forward dialogue on this measure. There was an emphasis on the need for flexibility and a general consensus that the safe third country concept should be part of the directive. The Irish Presidency intends to reflect on these discussions and to bring forward new ideas to reflect their outcome as soon as possible.</p>

     the progress made to date in regard to the implementation of the Civil Service action plan drawn up to meet the requirements of the benchmarking process within his own Department and within the public service generally; if the Civil Service performance verification group has decided that the level of progress warrants the payment of the general round and the benchmarking award on 1 January 2004; if payments will be withheld in any sector due to failure to make adequate progress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_815">Considerable progress has been made by my Department and by organisations associated with my Department operating within the justice and equality sector on the implementation of modernisation requirements, as set out in the Civil Service action plan, under Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement 2003-05. Key areas of improvement include the more efficient use of financial, staff and IT resources, enhanced customer service, better staff training and development, further development of partnership, regulatory reform and commitments in the area of equality of opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">In accordance with the procedures set out in Sustaining Progress, the first progress report on my Department's action plan was submitted to the Civil Service performance verification group in October 2003. On 15 December the CSPVG wrote to the Secretary General of my Department conveying its decision that the progress achieved by my Department on the implementation of commitments in its modernisation action plan warranted payment of the general round and benchmarking increases due on 1 January 2004 to all grades of staff in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">A separate justice and equality sector performance verification group, chaired by Ms Olive Braiden, was established to discharge the verification requirements under Sustaining Progress for organisations in the justice and equality sector. The 14 organisations in the justice and equality sector under this group's remit are as follows: the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds; the Courts Service; the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner; the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the Irish Prison Service; the Probation and Welfare Service; the Legal Aid Board, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations; the Equality Tribunal; the Equality Authority; the National Disability Authority; the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, the Forensic Science Laboratory; the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; and the Film Censor's Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">Each of these organisations submitted progress reports on the implementation of their action plans to the justice and equality sector performance verification group in October 2003. On the 17 December the justice and equality sector PVG wrote to the heads of these 14 organisations conveying its decision that the progress on action plans achieved by each of the 14 organisations under its remit warranted payment of the general round and benchmarking increases due on 1 January 2004, with the exception of grades represented by the Prison Officers' Association, in respect of which a decision as to whether payment was warranted was deferred. The PVG has continued to defer that decision while discussions in relation to the situation in the Prison Service are continuing under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">The Deputy will be interested to know that the Department's and the 14 associated organisations' action plans are on the Department's website, as is the report of the justice and equality PVG on the first progress reports submitted by the 14 sectoral organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">With regard to the Garda Síochána, following acceptance by the four Garda staff associations of the report of the public service benchmarking body and the terms of Sustaining Progress, an agreed report of the Garda conciliation council recording such agreement was signed by all parties on 28 November 2003. A performance verification group was nominated by the Commissioner and it approved the Garda action plan on 1 December 2003. The appropriate procedure set out in Sustaining Progress in respect of the payment of the general round and benchmarking increases due on 1 January 2004 is in train following the submission by the Commissioner of the first progress report.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">My Department and its associated bodies are continuing to implement modernisation commitments contained in their action plans and will be reporting to the verification groups at the end of April ahead of the 2% general round increase due on 1 July 2004.</p>

     <b>Mr. Eamon Ryan </b>
      asked the

     the action taken by him to promote the ratification of the optional protocol to the torture convention; and his plans to promote adequate monitoring of prison conditions here.
     [2523/04]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_334">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_823">On 18 December 2002, the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the draft optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, OP-CAT, with Ireland's support. The EU has called upon all member states to sign and ratify the optional protocol. There are 21 signatory states to the optional protocol. The following EU member states are signatories to the optional protocol: Denmark; Sweden; and the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">The object of the protocol is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken by independent international and national bodies to places of detention with a view to preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The international body is proposed to be a sub-committee of the UN Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. The national bodies may consist of one or several bodies as national preventive mechanisms for the prevention of torture at the domestic level.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">The question of whether to sign the optional protocol with a view to subsequent ratification is currently under consideration. My Department is reviewing national legislation to ascertain whether legislative changes would be required before signature and ratification of the optional protocol. It will be necessary to consult other Government Departments, including the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, regarding arrangements for the inspection of institutions for which they are responsible in which persons may be detained without their consent.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">With regard to monitoring of the prison system, it is already the subject of scrutiny by independent bodies, including the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe. The CPT was established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in 1987. Ireland was the third country to ratify the convention, which is now ratified by 40 European States. The committee is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts, parliamentarians, etc., from the member states and carries out its task by periodic and <i>ad hoc</i> visits. During these visits, the committee has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained, whether it be a prison, a Garda station or a mental hospital, and are entitled to speak in private to any detained person. The CPT visited Ireland for inspection purposes in May of 2002 and its report and the Government's response to it was published on 18 September 2003. The report and the Government's response are available on the Council of Europe's website, <i>www.coe.cpt.int</i>. Printed copies of the report and the Government's response have been laid before the Houses of Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">In addition, the Government appointed in 2002 an Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Mr Justice Dermot Kinlen, whose terms of reference include inspecting and reporting on prisons and other places of detention that are administered by the Irish Prison Service on behalf of my Department. Issues that he has regard to include: the attitude of staff and inmates; health, safety and well-being of prisoners; the conditions of the buildings; questions of humanity and propriety; and any general pattern which may indicate possible inadequacies in the management of the prison. The inspector has highlighted a number of concerns in his reports to me. These reports have been made available to both Houses and to the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">The prison visiting committees also report to me on an annual basis and their reports are also available on request. All prisoners have access to the prison visiting committee, to the prison chaplain, to the prison doctor and to the courts. A prisoner may also directly contact the European Court of Human Rights and the CPT. I am satisfied that there is adequate provision to monitor prison conditions here in an open and transparent manner.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_830">I have been informed by the Garda Síochána that its strategy to tackle organised crime involves the utilisation of specialised national units dedicated to the investigation-detection of such types of crime. These units are the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda national immigration bureau, all of which operate under the control and direction of an assistant commissioner in charge of national support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">These units investigate every aspect of organised crime and in conjunction with the special detective unit are constantly involved in operations to interrupt the flow of firearms to criminal groupings. On this latter issue, I should also add that the Minister is currently undertaking a review of firearms control policy with the intention of introducing legislation in this area. The security of weapons held legitimately by individuals or dealers will be central to this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">The Garda Síochána in general, and specifically all national units, works in common cause in the investigation of serious and organised crime in accordance with the strategic goals of the Garda Síochána. Legislative measures taken by the Government in recent years, backed up by significant law enforcement measures, have significantly altered the environment within which organised criminal groups operate in Ireland. The targeting of serious and organised crime will continue to be a priority and will be undertaken by the national support services targeting areas of criminality, individuals and groups operating nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">In my address of 9 December 2003 to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights I addressed in some detail, with particular reference to the activities of criminal gangs, the measures I intend to bring forward to enhance the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. My address in this respect is available on the website of the Houses of the Oireachtas at <i>www.irlgov.ie/oireachtas</i> but a copy will, of course, be made available to the Deputy if he so wishes. I intend to provide for those measures which require legislative provision in the criminal justice Bill, which I expect to publish during the current session.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">I assure the Deputy that the my commitment to dealing with organised crime is unwavering and I am constantly evaluating our response to this problem. In this context, the Minister will take whatever measures are necessary to deal with this menace.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">In line with a commitment I gave when I met representatives of the Coroners Society of Ireland, I hope to be in a position to bring a proposal to Government, early this year, for a short Bill to amend the Coroners Act 1962 so as to deal with a certain number of critical issues that need to be addressed as a priority. These concern the ending of the restriction on the number of medical and other witnesses at an inquest, increased sanctions for those who might refuse to co-operate at an inquest and a more coherent restatement of the scope of the provisions for mandatory inquests, which will include all deaths in custody. I remain conscious that a suitably more comprehensive reform of the coroners service, taking due account of the recommendations of the review group and developments since, is required in the medium term.</p>

There are two possible options in regard to the replacement of the outdated accommodation at Mountjoy Prison. The first is to redevelop the prison on the existing site involving the demolition and reconstruction of existing buildings. The second option is to relocate the prison to a greenfield site. My preference, as I have recently indicated, is for the relocation of Mountjoy Prison to a new site and I intend to bring this proposal to Government in the next week or so.</p>

            <p eId="para_840">I refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on this matter on 25 November 2003. The Human Rights Commission has now recruited the final member of its administrative staff, which brings its staffing complement to the ten staff requested by it. The chief executive of the commission was appointed in June 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The commission recently moved to its new permanent office accommodation which is located in Jervis House, Jervis Street, Dublin 1 and that will be a crucial factor which will enhance its capability to provide services to the public in line with its wide statutory mandate and remit, as outlined in section 8 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. In that regard, I direct the Deputy's attention to the commission's first strategic plan 2003 to 2006, which it published on 31 March 2003. The plan sets out the areas of work on which the commission proposes to focus over the next four years, and it is a key document in the process of the commission's ongoing consultation and dialogue.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">The commission's budget for 2003 was €1.28 million. However, it also received an additional once off payment of €536,000 in 2003 to assist it in the acquisition of its new premises. The commission's budget for 2004 is €1.823 million.</p>

     the position in respect of the establishment of the Garda Síochána compensation tribunal which was recommended in 1997; and the reason there has been so little progress in the meantime.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_844">The Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945 provide for a scheme of compensation for members of the Garda Síochána who are maliciously injured in the course of their duty or in respect of the performance of their duties as members of the force and for the dependants of members who have died from injuries maliciously inflicted on them. Under section 6 of the 1941 Act, a member of the Garda Síochána who has been maliciously injured may sue the State only by an authorisation issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">In 1997 a committee was established to review and make recommendations on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána compensation scheme operating under the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945. The committee comprised representatives from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance, the Attorney General's Office, the Chief State Solicitor's office, Garda management and two Garda staff associations, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association. A medical practitioner who had experience of life assurance work was also on the committee which was chaired by an independent chairman. The committee presented its report to the then Minister on 28 August 1997. The committee made 14 recommendations which included the repeal of the existing Acts and the setting up of a new Garda Síochána compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">The Minister has stated in his answers to Parliamentary Question No. 63 on 15 October 2003, and Parliamentary Question No. 555 on 4 November 2003, that he has taken steps to establish a Garda Síochána Compensation Tribunal, along the lines recommended by the committee set up in 1997. Following acceptance by the four Garda staff associations of the report of the public service benchmarking body and the terms of Sustaining Progress, an agreed report of the Garda conciliation council recording such agreement was signed by all parties on 28 November 2003. The establishment of a Garda compensation tribunal is one of the items included in the related pay agreement and the modernisation agenda in the Garda Síochána. Agreement had not been achievable up to then. It is intended that this matter will be finalised with the Garda associations within the next couple of months.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The tribunal will operate along the same lines as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, the main difference being that gardaí would be compensated for pain and suffering. It is envisaged that trainee gardaí who suffer malicious injuries prior to attestation would be covered under the new scheme and that claims already refused under the existing Acts as being minor would be allowed go before the tribunal. The Minister is confident that the Garda staff associations will co-operate with the necessary legislative change.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28, 31 and 134 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">Following agreement reached between the Irish and British Governments at Weston Park in 2001, Mr. Justice Peter Cory, a retired Canadian supreme court judge, was appointed to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion between British and Irish security forces and paramilitaries in six cases. Two of the cases — the murders of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan and the murders of Northern Ireland Lord Justice Maurice Gibson and Lady Cecily Gibson — relate to allegations of collusion by the Garda Síochána and these reports were submitted to the Irish Government. The other four cases — the murders of Mr. Pat Finucane, Mr. Robert Hamill, Ms Rosemary Nelson and Mr. Billy Wright — relate to allegations of collusion by British security forces and these were submitted to the British Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">The aim of the process was to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of collusion between state security forces and those responsible for the killings in each case to warrant a public inquiry. Following receipt of Government approval, I published the two reports submitted to the Irish Government on 18 December 2003. Copies of the these reports are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">In respect of the killings of Lord and Lady Gibson, Mr. Justice Cory concluded that there is no evidence of collusion that would warrant the holding of an inquiry. Accordingly, no further action by the Government is required in this case. In respect of the killings of the two RUC officers, Mr. Justice Cory concluded that evidential material was revealed that, if accepted, could be found to constitute collusion. As a result, Mr. Justice Cory considers that there must be a public inquiry into these killings. It is important to note, however, that Mr. Justice Cory did not find that collusion had taken place; the nature of his investigation allowed him to conclude only that there is sufficient evidence to warrant a public inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">Accordingly, in keeping with the commitments of the two Governments as part of the Weston Park agreement, I have secured Government approval for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921-2002, with the scope to inquire into allegations that employees of the State colluded in the fatal shootings of the two RUC officers on 20 March 1989. My Department is currently drafting specific terms of reference for the tribunal, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, and I intend to secure further Government approval as soon as possible to bring the necessary resolutions before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the statistical information provided in the evaluation of the Garda Síochána Policing Plan 2002, contained in the commissioner's annual report for 2002, is sourced from several places, including academic research programmes, overseas national and international organisations, for example, Interpol and the UK Home Office, in addition to internal Garda research.</p>

All statistics in the annual report are subjected to a stringent validation process before publication. In January 2003, I established, with Government approval, an expert group on crime statistics to examine the methods of collation and presentation of crime statistics by the Garda Síochána and other organisations involved in criminal prosecution. I look forward to receiving its report in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 66 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The first annual report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention contains a substantial number of recommendations aimed at improving services and conditions in prisons generally, as well as specific recommendations on particular prisons inspected.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">The most serious shortcomings identified by the inspector are the outdated and unacceptable conditions at Mountjoy and Portlaoise prisons where there is still a requirement for prisoners to perform the demeaning and degrading practiceof daily slopping out. The inspector's recommendations that both of these prisons be replaced in their entirety by modern prison facilities coincide fully with my own prior conclusions and those of the Prisons Authority interim board. Construction work is already under way at Portlaoise Prison to provide new gatelock and prisoner reception facilities and tenders will be invited shortly for the much needed new prisoner accommodation to replace the outdated ‘D' and ‘E' blocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">There are two possible options in regard to the replacement of the outdated accommodation at Mountjoy Prison. The first option is to redevelop the prison on the existing site involving the demolition and reconstruction of existing buildings. The second option is to relocate the prison to a greenfield site. My preference, as I have recently indicated, is for the relocation of Mountjoy Prison to a new site and I intend to bring this proposal to Government in the next week or so.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">Other recommendations made by the inspector are being implemented as opportunity and resources permit. Several of the more straightforward recommendations have already been implemented. A medical officer is due to take up duty in February at Portlaoise Prison and a recruitment competition to fill vacancies for psychologists will be advertised in the coming weeks. Emergency exit, assembly signs and so forth have been put in place in the Dóchas Centre and fire evacuation drills organised as required. It is intended that all precautionary and emergency procedures for fire will be examined at each institution on the appointment of the Irish Prison Service's new fire officer. An offer of appointment to the highest placed candidate in the recent competition for fire officer will issue this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">At the prior initiative of the Prisons Authority interim board, and coinciding with the inspector's recommendations, television points have been provided in all cells at Mountjoy Prison and netting is being provided at Cloverhill Prison to frustrate the efforts of persons outside the prison who throw illicit drugs into the yards during prisoner recreation times. A comprehensive report on measures taken to implement the recommendations of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention will be included in the annual report of the Irish Prison Service for 2003 which is currently being prepared.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">Draft provisions for a statutory prisons inspectorate are being prepared in the context of the Prisons Bill which is under preparation in my Department at present.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_908">As the Deputy is aware, the key headline statistics for 2002 were first released in their provisional format in April 2003. The final validated statistics published recently in the commissioner's annual report do not differ significantly from those provisional figures. The statistics for provisional headline offences for 2003 were made public on 21 January 2004 and show a cumulative decrease of 2% for 2003 compared with 2002. The figures in 2003 showed a welcome and marked decrease in most categories.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Although there were increases in the categories of rape of a female, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault in 2002, the Deputy will be pleased to note the reduction in these categories in 2003 of 19%, 54% and 7% respectively. Furthermore, cases of assault causing harm decreased by 21% in 2003 which represents the largest volume decrease of any offence in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">It is my conviction that this Government's firm and coherent strategy for dealing with crime is proving effective. The gardaí are being given the resources to investigate crime, the courts are being given the resources to deal effectively with criminal cases, and I will continue to ensure that those convicted of crime will serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">A significant number of the robberies, thefts from the person and similar type offences concern mobile phone thefts. I believe mobile phone theft will decline steeply with the introduction of the new technology that renders stolen mobile phones useless where the victim records the phone's IMEI number and informs his-her network of the theft.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">I wish to point out to the Deputy that there are complicating factors in relation to the 2002 statistics, not least of which is the conclusion, based on a detailed analysis of the data, that a certain proportion of the increase in the figures for recorded headline crime is due to the increases in recording rates resulting from the phasing in of the Garda PULSE IT system. The positive benefits of PULSE can be noted in the more detailed treatment of non-headline crime statistics in the 2002 report, which are extracted from the PULSE system for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">The Expert Group on Crime Statistics which I established has been engaged for the past year on a detailed examination of the methods of collation and presentation of crime statistics, and I understand that, as part of its work, it has examined the question of the timeliness of the production of the Garda crime statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">As the Deputy will be aware, I have already arranged for the release of provisional statistics on a quarterly basis. My initiative ensures that members of the public, those working in the criminal justice system and public representatives have almost immediate access to this important quality of life indicator. I am informed that the delay in producing the commissioner's 2002 report was due to the volume of work involved in extracting and formulating the non-headline statistics which, as I have mentioned, were extracted from PULSE for the first time. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that work has already commenced on the compilation of the 2003 annual report and it is expected that it will be submitted significantly earlier.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_355">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_916">The most up-to-date figures on wage levels in Ireland show a gap of approximately 15% in the average hourly earnings of women when compared with men. This data is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute from the Living in Ireland survey. The ESRI research found that the greater part of the gender pay gap is because women interrupt their careers to care for children with consequent loss of job experience and promotion opportunities. Women's over-representation in low paid positions and their under-representation in senior levels were also significant factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">The gender pay gap is an indicator of progress towards the achievement of gender equality in the labour market. Research by the ESRI indicates that the gap has been reduced from 20% in 1987, to 18% in 1994, and to 15% in 1997. Preliminary figures for 2000 indicate a further narrowing by 0.3% to 14.7% in the period 1997 to 2000. The figures indicate that women's pay levels have improved relative to men's in the period, although the rate of progress has slowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">Our existing wage data sets do not permit annual monitoring of the gender wage gap. The national employment survey which has been introduced by the Central Statistics Office will provide regular economy-wide data on the gender pay gap. The first results from this new survey are due for publication in mid-2004. This is a significant development and will allow us to track the gender wage gap and also to understand movements in the figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">My Department chaired the consultative group, set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to report to Government on actions required to address the gender pay gap. The group's report has been finalised and was formally presented to Government in November 2003. It contains a number of recommendations addressing a wide range of Government policies including child care, the development of family friendly policies, the promotion of equal opportunities policies, statutory minimum wages and taxation. The consultative group has also overseen sectoral studies on the gender pay gap in the IT — electrical and electronic, retail, food and local government sectors. My Department has recently commissioned research on the gender wage gap among graduates. It is expected that this research, which is being carried out by the ESRI, will be completed by the end of 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">A significant part of the work of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including the ongoing implementation of the equal opportunities child care programme and the proposals to strengthen the provisions of the Maternity, Parental and Adoptive Leave Acts, will have a positive impact on the gender pay gap. Also relevant is the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in overseeing the implementation of the Government commitment to gender balance on State boards. Currently women constitute 30% of state board nominees and 35% of Government nominees. In addition, the equality for women measure is also making an important contribution to addressing the gender pay gap through the identification of best practice on gender equality. More generally, Government support for equal opportunities in education and training and for the equal opportunities infrastructure, together with the statutory minimum wage, are important elements of our overall strategy to address the gender wage gap and to ensure equal opportunities for women and men at work.</p>

            <p eId="para_925">The paedophile investigation unit is located within the domestic violence and sexual assault unit which in turn forms part of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. I am informed that the unit, which is augmented by additional personnel from mainstream units as required, co-ordinates Garda investigations of child pornography and investigates alleged breaches of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 brought to its attention by the Internet Advisory Board hotline, concerned citizens, Interpol, Europol and external police forces. The unit is also proactive in its work. It monitors Internet chat rooms and strives to maintain best practise in the investigation of child pornography with an emphasis on Internet investigations. I understand from the Garda authorities that the unit currently has approximately 40 cases of alleged offences on hand. A small number of cases concerning the production and distribution of child pornographic images have been successfully prosecuted in this jurisdiction and a number of suspected cases are currently under investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">The legislation giving effect in Ireland to the EU framework decision on the European arrest warrant was enacted during the last session and the European Arrest Warrant Act came into operation on 1 January 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">The Act contains numerous protections for arrested persons, such as a right to legal representation and interpretation services. However, section 37 of the Act covering fundamental rights reflects the provisions in Article 1.3 and in recitals 12 and 13 of the framework decision. It sets the general grounds for consideration by the High Court of European arrest warrants and provides that a person shall not be surrendered unless there is compliance with the section. The section provides for the need to respect fundamental rights, including rights under the Constitution and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its protocols, as well as a range of specific rights aimed at protecting the rights of certain classes of people, minorities, etc. It also includes grounds for refusal where there is a possibility of the death penalty or inhuman or degrading treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">Article 1.3 of the framework decision refers to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and provides that "the Framework Decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligations to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union".</p>
            <p eId="para_934">Recital 12 affirms that the framework decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 6 states, <i> inter alia</i>, that “the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms”. This recital also provides that a warrant may be refused where there are reasons to believe it was issued for reasons related to the person's race, religion, sex, etc. It adds that the framework decision does not prevent a member state from applying its constitutional rules on due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">Recital 13 states that "no person shall be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". Section 11(3) of the Act gives effect to Ireland's statement that European arrest warrants would be executed only for the purposes of bringing a person to trial or for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or detention order. Ireland made that statement when the framework decision was being adopted. It ensures that persons who are not yet convicted are surrendered to face trial rather than for investigative purposes. The European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 contains comprehensive human rights safeguards.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_940">In September 2002 I asked the legal advisory group to report to me on the issues involved with regard to defamation and to make recommendations. This request was on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government. I brought the report to Government in June 2003 but it is the group's report, not a report by me to Government or a report of the Government which has made no decision in respect of the substance of the contents of the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">The report contains some 23 separate recommendations. The group also put forward a suggested text for a new defamation Act which would completely replace the Defamation Act 1961. This is a very useful and helpful approach since we are concerned with a potential legislative outcome and it is, therefore, very informative to see how the various recommendations would translate into legislative form. One of the terms of reference for the group was to consider the nature and extent of any statutory intervention which might attach to the establishment of any entity concerned with the regulation of the press. This is a subject on which there are diverging views as to the optimum approach to be followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">On the one hand, there is a need to achieve a form of regulation which is effective and in which the public can have confidence. On the other hand, care must be had to ensure that any regulatory framework does not trespass needlessly upon the traditional freedoms which the press enjoys in all democratic societies. Having considered the options, the group recommended the establishment of a statutory press council with functions which would include the preparation of a press code of conduct and the investigation of complaints concerning alleged breaches of that code. The report sets out, in some detail, the main features of such a council including proposals for its operation and structure. The draft defamation Bill contains a template for the legislative intervention which would be required were such an entity to be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">The model examined by the group is neither the only nor the most obvious model for a statutory press council. There could be a body chaired by a judge, and composed of nominees of various groups to reflect the different interests involved such as the public, media owners, and journalists. The public interest might be represented in several ways including some form of proportionate selection by elected public representatives to ensure that the Government of the day could not swamp the council with its sympathisers. Other models were suggested which I will consider carefully before bringing a proposal to Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">There are other important recommendations in the report. For example, the proposed new defence of reasonable publication; the rebalancing of the role which judge and jury have at present in defamation actions commenced in the High Court; the Circuit Court to have jurisdiction in all defamation cases where the amount of the damages claimed does not exceed €50,000; a one-year limitation period for defamation actions and the enshrinement in legislation of a defence to be known as the "defence of innocent publication" which would be available, among others, to broadcasters, distributors, printers and Internet service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">The advisory group endorsed many of the recommendations put forward by the Law Reform Commission in its report on the civil law of defamation, such as making an apology, court lodgements and the rationalisation of the defences of absolute and qualified privilege. It is a mark of the excellence of the work done by the Law Reform Commission that the report which it prepared on this topic remains so seminal and so influential.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">Some of the recommendations are more radical than others and will provoke considerable comment which will secure an informed and wide-ranging debate on this important topic. In consultation with my colleagues in Government, I decided the best way to proceed was to have a period of public consultation which will allow all interested parties to comment on the substance of the recommendations contained in the report. The deadline for receipt of submissions is 31 January 2004. I also held a major conference on 1 December last to facilitate an exchange of views from a cross-section of interested parties. This was well attended and thought provoking.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Following completion of the consultative process I intend to reflect carefully on the consensus that emerges on the issues and also on the best way forward on the proposals I bring to Government. I hope to bring forward proposals in the latter half of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_950">The Government has a wide-ranging strategy for meeting its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. In so far as asylum seekers are concerned, a comprehensive infrastructure has been provided in the form of the office of the refugee applications commissioner and the refugee appeals tribunal to process asylum applications fairly. These offices are processing applications much more speedily than in the past. Accommodation and other support services such as health care education services and legal aid are also provided to asylum seekers. In 2002 some €340 million was spent on service provision to asylum seekers. While a figure for 2003 is not yet available, my Department alone will provide some €120 million for asylum processing, accommodation, legal aid to asylum seekers and related immigration services in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">In response to specific points made in the IRC review, the Government does not intend to change the present policy on access to work by asylum seekers. As I have pointed out several times in reply to parliamentary questions, there are many reasons why the present policy of not allowing asylum seekers to take up paid employment should not be changed. It would not be possible under current legislation and would have a major negative impact on the Government's asylum strategy; be a major pull factor leading to a large increase in asylum applications; undermine the present legitimate entry process for immigration and employment; have potential implications for trafficking; have a negative impact on our ability to accommodate asylum applicants and provide them with a reasonable level of State services.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The IRC review also referred to the implications of placing asylum seekers in accommodation centres under direct provision arrangements. Great care is taken to ensure that these centres operate to the highest standard and all asylum seekers have full access to health and child education services. I am not convinced that the present legislative provision in the Refugee Act 1996 provides a suitable framework in which to move forward. Accordingly, I am considering whether an alternative framework might be available which would be capable of making a value-added contribution to asylum and refugee matters and, in particular, be of benefit to those genuinely in need of protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">I am committed to the integration of refugees in Ireland. One of the key responsibilities of the reception and integration agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is to co-ordinate the implementation of integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain in the State. The agency continuously helps refugees by providing information, support and advice and this support is particularly intensive for refugees who are being resettled in Ireland as part of a Government decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">At a policy level, the agency has now concluded a series of intensive consultations with non-Governmental organisations and service providers working with refugees and asylum seekers. As well as hosting the integration forum referred to in the IRC's review, the agency recently concluded a conference on the strategic use of the European Refugee Fund. The agency is the responsible authority for the administration of the fund in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The agency, which has representatives from key Departments, recently hosted five regional conferences for asylum support groups with a view to developing common agendas for action. The outcome of these meetings will underpin a range of agency initiatives addressing co-ordination by all key partners, including support groups, non-Governmental organisations and service providers. The agency also operates a small grants scheme for the activities of asylum support groups, with an annual fund of €140,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The national anti-racism awareness programme, which operated under the aegis of my Department, co-produced a leaflet entitled Myths and Misinformation about Asylum Seekers. Against a background of these initiatives and the agency's ongoing focus on integration, I am committed to ensuring that no underclass emerges in Irish society. The forthcoming publication of the National Action Plan Against Racism will cover a wide range of integration measures and will aim to address issues of social inclusion and cultural diversity.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">On 11 November 2003, the Government decided to implement a number of measures to reduce prison operating costs with effect from 1 January 2004, in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on the proposed change agenda, aimed at eliminating overtime and reducing costs. These measures included the temporary closure of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel Places of Detention.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The Curragh Place of Detention closed on 20 January and Fort Mitchel will close on 10 February 2004, if there is no agreement with the Prison Officers' Association by that date. I have already made it clear on several occasions that I fully appreciate the good work being done at Fort Mitchel and other prison institutions scheduled for closure. I personally do not want to close those institutions but, if the Prison Officers' Association is unwilling to agree reasonable terms to operate them on an economically sustainable basis, it is a course I reluctantly have to pursue. I have also indicated that if such agreement is forthcoming from the Prison Officers' Association, prison closures could yet be cancelled or reversed.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Closure of Fort Mitchel Place of Detention would yield significant savings by facilitating the transfer of prison staff to Cork and Limerick Prisons to perform work which is currently done on an overtime basis. In addition, savings would arise from non-payment of the allowance which is paid to staff for working on the island; non-operation of the daily ferry to the island; and elimination of the above average general costs associated with operating an island facility.</p>

            <p eId="para_996">At its meeting on 29 September 2003, the Government established a group comprising the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance and myself to deal with the evolving industrial relations situation in the Prison Service, including putting in place contingency arrangements in the event of industrial action. In line with this decision, I can confirm that a considerable amount of contingency planning has been undertaken regarding the possible use of Garda and Defence Force personnel in the event of industrial action in the prisons. I can also confirm that, in such a situation, the Defence Forces will play a significant role. Pursuant to that role, army personnel have been engaged in a familiarisation process which has included a series of visits to the prisons. The Deputy will appreciate that, for obvious operational and security reasons, I am not in a position to go into the details of the arrangements which have been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">I would also refer the Deputy to my written reply to Question No. 398 on 9 December 2003.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">The report of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board for the year 2002 was published last December 2003 having been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">In welcoming the publication of the report, I observed that in previous reports the board had pointed up what it considered to be the shortcomings of the legislation under which it operates, and noted that in its 2002 report the board acknowledged the Government's intention to address the issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">I will shortly publish a Garda Síochána Bill, one of the principal aims of which will be the establishment of a Garda ombudsman body to deal with complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána under a new mechanism which will address the concerns expressed by the board.</p>

     the steps being taken to reduce the waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor at the legal aid centres in view of the fact that the average waiting time is five months and that this can rise to 13 months at some centres; the additional funding which has been provided in the estimates for 2004 to reduce waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1003">The Deputy will appreciate that under section 5(1) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, it is the function of the Legal Aid Board to provide, from within its resources and subject to the other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Act and the regulations made thereunder. In addition, under section 30 of the Act, responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided, including the location of law centres, the staffing required by these centres and the use of private practitioners, is a matter for the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">I would also mention to the Deputy that, regarding those applicants waiting for legal services, the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are time limits. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. I understand that during 2002 such priority cases accounted for over 20% of the total caseload handled by the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">I can also inform the Deputy that the allocation for the Legal Aid Board in 2004 is €18.388 million. This represents an increase of almost 5% over the 2003 provision of €17.539 million. I can further inform the Deputy that in recent years the level of funding provided to the board has increased significantly. During the period from 1997 to date, the grant-in-aid has increased by 74%, from €10.563 million in 1997 to €18.388 million in 2004. In addition, sanction for the board to employ additional full-time solicitors was also received during this period. These increased resources have enabled the board to provide legal services to a greater number of people.</p>

As I stated then, the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997, provide for the recording of interviews in respect of suspects who are detained in custody. In 1999, the Government decided to introduce an audio-video system for the recording of such interviews and the number of stations and rooms now fitted out with the specialised equipment is such as to provide broad nationwide coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">I stress again that there is a total of 703 Garda stations throughout the State. Many of these are rural stations and are not equipped to accommodate the holding of prisoners and are open for a set number of hours or days per week. It was never the intention, nor is it considered necessary, that all 703 Garda stations or that every interview room in these stations be fitted out with the system. I am advised by the Garda authorities that the number of rooms and stations fitted out provides the nationwide coverage envisaged by the Government decision.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
            <p eId="para_1085">Under Community law it is a requirement that imported meat from outside the EU has been sourced from an approved establishment, whether that is a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store. It must also be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or health certificate that bears the identity of the establishment from which the beef has been despatched.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">Under EU harmonised rules, imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, FVO. This office carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. The evaluation of third countries is on the following basis: there are systems in place for the rapid detection, reporting and confirmation of list A diseases of the <i>Office International des Epizooties, </i>OIE; there is access to laboratory facilities that allow detection and confirmation to take place; there are animal disease control systems in place whose operation and outcome must be recorded and demonstrable, e.g. registration of holdings, animal identification and movement controls; there are operational contingency plans for the control of and/or the eradication of OIE list diseases; and that the import policy in the country, including its controls, as well as the animal health situation in neighbouring countries have been assessed as acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">Where the FVO is not satisfied that public health requirements are being met by an approved establishment in a third country, the establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">Meat being imported into the European Community may only enter through a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the FVO. That office also carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure that the facilities and procedures for import of animal products into Europe, provided under harmonised EU legislation, are being correctly applied. In Ireland, the border inspection posts approved for administering checks on direct imports of meat from third countries are Dublin Port and Shannon Airport and these posts are staffed by officials from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">In addition, importers must be registered with my Department. They must give advance notice of the arrival of meat. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation which shows country and approval number of the establishment of production as well as a health certificate which conforms to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be appropriately labelled. All consignments undergo a documentary and identity check and physical checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. Where required, sampling for laboratory analysis for the purposes of safeguarding human and animal health is carried out. Once imported, meat has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its declared destination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1106">The person named originally held four suckler cow quota rights when he submitted an application for an allocation of additional quota from the 2004 suckler cow national reserve. His application was processed and he was allocated four additional quota rights and was notified accordingly. Following the subsequent contact with the person named on 19 December 2003, an additional six quota rights were allocated to him from the 2004 suckler cow national reserve. Since he had already received four additional quota rights from the reserve, this brought his total allocation to ten premium rights, which was the maximum allocation that any applicant received from the 2004 national reserve. His total suckler cow quota was therefore increased from four, which he originally had, to 14 premium rights for the 2004 suckler cow premium scheme. A letter confirming the additional allocation and his new quota issued to him on 19 December 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">If the person named has more than 14 suckler cows on which he wishes to claim suckler cow premium under the 2004 scheme, he may purchase or lease in additional quota in order to qualify for payment. It should be noted that it will be essential to lodge an area aid application in 2004 if the person named wants to qualify for payment in excess of 15 livestock units.</p>

     if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the recent UK census which shows that the Irish in Britain are more likely to be living in residential care than any other group, and that they are the group most likely to be providing over 50 hours per week of unpaid care to relatives, friends and neighbours.

            <p eId="para_1130">The census of England and Wales was conducted in April 2001. It showed that 1% of the Irish in Britain were resident in hospitals or other care establishments. It also showed that the Irish have older age structures than other ethnic groups, with one in four Irish people in Britain aged 65 and over. As a result, they are more likely to need care. This is particularly true as the Irish group that went to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s grows older.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">The 2001 census was the first in which a question about carers was included. It found that there are 5.2 million people providing unpaid care in England and Wales, that is, one in ten of the population. Carers were defined in the census as people looking after or giving help or support to family members, friends, neighbours or others because of long-term physical or mental ill health or disability or problems related to old age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The responses showed that 10% of each of the groups categorised in the census as "White British", "White Irish" and "Indian" were providing unpaid care. The "White Irish" group had, by a small margin, 2.5%, the highest rate of providing over 50 hours a week of care. This reflects the older age structure of the Irish community in Britain which makes them more likely to provide care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The Irish Government, through the Díon committee, provides significant levels of support to the older Irish in Britain. In 2003, €873,000 was spent on projects for the elderly and €119,000 on projects for returning emigrants. This represents 43% of the Díon fund in 2003. Several of these projects involve social activities which have added health benefits, helping older people to continue to live independently for longer. In addition, older Irish people have access to welfare organisations assisted by the Díon fund which provide advice on welfare and health benefits available to them.</p>

The council insisted that the illegal armed groups cease all hostilities and engage in constructive and meaningful dialogue. In particular, while acknowledging the recent release of some hostages, the council underlined the importance of a rapid release of all remaining hostages and kidnapped persons.

            <p eId="para_1153">The Public Service Benchmarking Body recommended that the payment of the benchmarking increases due with effect from 1 January 2004 and 1 June 2005 should be dependent on real and verifiable outputs from modernisation and flexibility changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">Resource teachers are comprehended within the modernisation agenda set out for teachers in paragraphs 24.27 to 24.33 of Sustaining Progress which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, revised arrangements for the holding of parent-teacher meetings and the standardisation of breaks at mid-term and holiday periods at Christmas and Easter. Agreement has now been reached on the issue of parent-teacher meetings and discussions are at an advanced stage on the standardised school holiday periods for future years. However, a number of difficulties have arisen in regard to issues on non-compliance by certain schools with the standardised arrangements agreed for the current school year and these are currently under discussion at the teachers conciliation council which is holding a special meeting on 3 February next to address these matters. I am anxious that these remaining difficulties are quickly resolved so that the payments to teachers can be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">No specific policy advice was issued by WHO to Ireland in respect of immigrant groups and screening for communicable diseases. Irish policy in this regard is informed with reference to WHO and EU advice generally in respect of communicable diseases, particularly in respect of global TB and HIV control. Policy is formulated on the basis that asylum seekers have the same right to medical treatment as the rest of the population and within the ethical guidelines for medical practice set out by the Medical Council. Screening policy is based on an epidemiological assessment of the communicable disease risks which affect these populations in particular and international best practice in the diagnosis, management and control of these diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">Currently the position in relation to screening is that screening in respect of specific infectious diseases is offered to asylum seekers on a voluntary and confidential basis, free of charge, shortly after their arrival in this country. The purpose of screening is to detect and treat certain infectious diseases in the interest of the asylum seekers themselves and their families, as well as the community in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">The approach adopted in relation to communicable disease screening for asylum seekers is reviewed on an ongoing basis by a group representative of the directors of public health and the Department of Health and Children. The current guidelines produced by this group in relation to infectious diseases screening recommend screening for TB and hepatitis and, where appropriate for HIV, polio and varicella zoster, chicken pox. The guidelines do not preclude other investigations deemed necessary on clinical or public health grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">Operational responsibility for health screening for asylum seekers lies with the individual health boards, which have appropriate regional and local management structures in place to manage delivery of the health screening programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged seventy years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board and authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. However, it should be noted that the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">I am conscious that increases in social welfare rates in recent years have given rise to a situation where such rates may exceed the income guidelines for a medical card. Because of this situation, my Department has written to the chairman of the chief executive officers' group on a number of occasions, most recently on 5 November 2003, asking that he advise the CEOs of my concern that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged by virtue of increases in social welfare payments which may be announced in the forthcoming budget. They were asked to ensure that increases in social welfare payments do not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards by reference to the income guidelines and to make every effort to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the issue raised by you and to reply directly to you in the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">Under the Health Act 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, for the treatment of that condition under the long term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, thalidamoid and acute leukaemia.</p>

            <p eId="para_1265">There are a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for individuals with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</p>

            <p eId="para_1273">I have already responded in this matter to a question from Deputy Haughey on Tuesday, 27 January 2004. My position is clear. Any allegations of serious wrongdoing by members of the Garda Síochána, such as those broadcast on the Prime Time programme, are of serious concern to me. Some of these cases were previously reported and in the public domain, and either have been or may be dealt with in the courts or by the existing complaints and disciplinary mechanisms, and I will not comment on the specific details of each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">I regard it as essential that there should be in place a mechanism for dealing with such cases which commands public confidence. In this regard I will shortly be publishing a Garda Síochána Bill, the draft scheme of which was approved by Government and published in July 2003, one of the principal aims of which will be the establishment of such a mechanism which will address the acknowledged shortcomings of the existing law and procedures in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1282">The commission received a total of 6,783 applicants, all of whom sat Stage 1, which consists of three written tests.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1297">The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Act also amends the Child Care Act 1991 by providing for the detention in special care units of non-offending children with challenging behaviour, establishes the Special Residential Services Board to ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to young children in detention, and re-enacts and updates provisions in the Children Act, 1908 protecting children from abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. The Act is a very complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i> inter alia</i>: the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children — section 113 of the Act; a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children — section 114 of the Act; the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a “Diversion Conference” — sections 17 to 51 of the Act — based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand. To date, in excess of 100 of these conferences have taken place country wide; and the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences — section 133 of the Act. The position in relation to further commencement is as set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act generally envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The successful implementation of the community based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. In this context, the probation and welfare service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand for the intensive training of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">From September 2003 to date, 14 additional probation and welfare officers have taken up duty and a response to other offers of appointment is awaited. It is the intention that, subject to an adequate number of staff being recruited, community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St. Patrick's Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom-designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles — 90 male and 20 female — is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred with the director general of the Prison Service, I decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, will not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</p>

            <p eId="para_1315">It is not, understandably, possible for the Garda Síochána to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for CCTV systems received by the CCTV advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters regarding CCTV systems, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">To this end, a grant-aid scheme has been launched to facilitate community based groups which wish to install their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to €100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from the Department towards the cost of such schemes. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority to install, maintain and monitor the community based CCTV schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">The following are some of the conditions required to be met before an application for funding can be considered. Approval for grant assistance to individual CCTV schemes will depend on the availability of funds. All valid applications received will not be automatically entitled to grant aid. Awards will be at the discretion of the Department, subject to the availability of funds and the number of valid applications received. It is not possible to determine the actual level of funding that will be available for grant assistance under this scheme. The 2004 CCTV budget amounts to just over €4 million and includes expenditure in relation to maintenance of current Garda schemes as well as the implementation of current and planned schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">The Department has received a significant number of expressions of interest — in excess of 200 — in the community based CCTV scheme. An application prospectus has been prepared by the Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available on request from the Department's Garda administration division.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda Síochána, are almost complete. When both the code of practice and the technical specifications have been finalised, the Department will issue copies of same to all communities which expressed an interest in the community based CCTV scheme and any applications subsequently received will be evaluated and processed. It is anticipated that the technical specifications and the code of practice will be finalised early this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have initiated a number of strategies designed to address the issue of organised criminal networks involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking. These measures include generic strategies utilised on an ongoing basis as well as new measures formulated in response to emerging issues and trends.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">In general terms, the Garda Síochána addresses the issues of drug trafficking through the following measures: conducting intelligence driven operations against criminal networks involved in drug distribution at both a national and international level; undermining the structures and systems which support this activity; and depriving criminal organisations of the proceeds arising from drug trafficking and related activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">The Garda national drugs unit, operating under national support services, has the primary responsibility for addressing national and international drug trafficking. This responsibility is discharged in co-operation with other enforcement agencies, most notably the Revenue service, as well as other national units and district and divisional drug units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Current strategies designed to address the present situation concerning drug distribution are outlined in the recently published annual policing plan 2004. This document sets out fourteen strategic goals and eight policing priorities. The policing priorities include strategies specifically designed to address both organised crime and drug distribution. Strategic goal two specifically relates to drug misuse and includes the following elements: co-ordination of district policing plans; continued implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008; inter-agency co-operation; information dissemination on substance misuse and related items; and support to both local and regional drug task forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">In regard to the measures which I will bring forward to enhance the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, including drugs offences, I refer the Deputy to my address of 9 December 2003 to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights where I addressed the issue in some detail, with particular reference to the activities of criminal gangs. I will be happy to make a copy of this address available to the Deputy if he so wishes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1429">Having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the service to decide how the funding provided is specifically allocated. The funding provided allows the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies and I am confident that the level of funding provided is adequate, not only to maintain existing levels of service, but also to provide for improvements in services and in court accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1431">At the outset, it should be stated that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is obliged to consider the issue of risk to a person before, not after, a deportation order issues in respect of that person. There are legislative and procedural safeguards to ensure that persons are not returned to countries where they are at risk.</p>

Where the Minister proposes to deport a person he or she is given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons they should not be deported, that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the order was made, or consenting to the making of deportation orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">Where representations are made setting out reasons a person should not be deported, the Minister is obliged to consider of number of factors as specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person's individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. Moreover, the Minister is also obliged to consider the prohibition on refoulement which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in the Minister's opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1463">I am informed by the Garda Síochána that its strategy to tackle organised crime involves the utilisation of specialised national units dedicated to the investigation-detection of such types of crime. These units are the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda National Immigration Bureau, all of which operate under the control and direction of an Assistant Commissioner in charge of national support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">These units investigate every aspect of organised crime and in conjunction with the special detective unit are constantly involved in operations to interrupt the flow of firearms to criminal groupings. On this latter issue, I should add that I am currently undertaking a review of firearms control policy with the intention of introducing legislation in this area. The security of weapons held legitimately by individuals or dealers will be central to this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">The Garda Síochána in general, and specifically all national units, work together in common cause in the investigation of serious and organised crime in accordance with the strategic goals of the Garda Síochána. Measures taken to combat crime, in general, include: CCTV systems which have proved to be a very effective deterrent; Garda youth diversion projects that adopt a multi-agency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level; and a new city centre policing initiative was launched on 9 June 2003 by the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region. This initiative provides high visibility policing presence in specific target areas in the north and south inner city centre areas. It targets issues of concern such as public order, assaults, street theft, shoplifting, addicts, beggars and general vagrancy.</p>

I hope to bring these proposals to Government in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1514">In issuing standards for on-site waste water treatment systems, the Department seeks to ensure the use of an appropriate system in each case, rather than the use of one method of waste water disposal over another. In a circular letter of 31 July 2003 on groundwater protection and the planning system, the Department also directed local authorities attention to the need for more information within development plans on the location and potential vulnerability of groundwater resources and for clear policies on how development in different areas will be approached based on the available information.</p>

I understand that the EPA is currently reviewing the draft manual in the light of comments received from interested parties. My intention is to call up the revised EPA manual, when available, in technical guidance document H — drainage and waste water disposal — on the national building regulations. I also understand that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, intends, at that stage, to withdraw SR6, 1991 in favour of the revised manual.</p>
