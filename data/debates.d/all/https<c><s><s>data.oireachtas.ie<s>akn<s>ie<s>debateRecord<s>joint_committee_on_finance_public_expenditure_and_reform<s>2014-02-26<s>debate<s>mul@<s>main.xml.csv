Before we commence business, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting. The meeting is being broadcast, not on cable but on a webcast, and there will be people watching it. Any mobile telephone interference creates technical difficulties. If there is interference, I will disrupt the meeting. If there is a difficulty, I will ask those concerned to leave. I welcome to this afternoon's meeting the special liquidators for IBRC, Mr. Kieran Wallace and Mr. Eamonn Richardson, and officials of the Department of Finance, Ms Ann Nolan, second secretary, Mr. Anthoine Mac Donncha, head of the legal unit, and Mr. Gary Hynds, assistant principal. The witnesses are here to discuss matters relating to the sale of the IBRC residential mortgage loan book. This discussion will begin with opening remarks from Mr. Richardson on behalf of the special liquidators. Following that, questions may be put by members to the special liquidators or officials, as appropriate. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I ask Mr. Richardson to proceed with his opening remarks.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	1	My name is Eamonn Richardson and I appear here today with my colleague and fellow special liquidator, Kieran Wallace. We thank the committee for this opportunity to present on the special liquidation process as it impacts on IBRC mortgage customers. With the committee's permission, we have an opening statement which we would like to provide to it. I will highlight some of the key contents from that statement. Then we will be available to take questions from the committee. The members of the committee will be aware that we retain obligations of confidentiality towards individual borrowers of IBRC and we are unable to discuss the specifics of any particular account or borrower. Furthermore, the sales process for the residential mortgage portfolio is ongoing with final bids due on 14 March 2014. As I am sure the members of the committee will appreciate, there are certain matters that remain commercially sensitive in relation to this transaction which we are unable to discuss. Mr. Wallace and I were appointed as joint special liquidators on 7 February 2013 under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013, IBRC, Act 2013. The passing of the IBRC Act and the appointment of the special liquidators was part of the promissory note transaction which yielded significant benefits for the State. On our appointment, we were instructed by the Minister for Finance to arrange for the valuation of IBRC's loan assets by independent advisers. In this regard, the special liquidators appointed PwC as independent advisers to value the residential mortgage portfolio. PwC was also appointed to provide independent advice in developing a robust and credible sales strategy for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio which would ensure that maximum value was achieved for the benefit of all creditors of IBRC. We understand the committee sought a copy of this report issued by PwC. In view of the commercially sensitive nature of the material contained in that report, we regret that we are not in a position to make this available or to put it into the public domain. It is also worth noting that, per the ministerial instructions, the assets of IBRC could only be sold at a price equal to or in excess of the independent valuations obtained. Should a bid in excess of the independent valuation obtained not be received, the loan asset will transfer to NAMA at the independent valuation price. I will give a general update on our loan sales processes to date. For operational reasons, the loan assets of IBRC have been divided into six portfolios, code named Evergreen, Sand, Rock, Salt, Stone and Pebble. The Sand portfolio comprises Irish originated residential mortgage loans with a par value of €1.8 billion. In total, there are 15,734 borrower groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the six portfolios. Thirty-three of these borrower groups, representing 0.2% of total borrower groups, were or are being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis. No IBRC borrower is being provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back his or her loans at a discount, and each sales process is a competitive sales process involving third parties. Within the Sand portfolio, there are 11,825 individual residential mortgage customers comprising 12,702 mortgages with a par value of €1.8 billion. Following receipt of legal advice, we corresponded with these residential mortgage holders and provided them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid on those loans. We received 1,224 residential mortgage holder representations. The special liquidators have reviewed and considered each representation. In addition, the representations were considered by PwC in delivering its sales strategy advice to us. The valuation of the Sand portfolio was completed on 11 November 2013, with the sales process commenced on 14 October 2013.As indicated, we expect to be in receipt of final bids on the portfolio on 14 March 2014. We did consider the concept of selling individual mortgages but for a number of reasons we could not proceed with that. We can discuss these with the committee in more detail later. However, some of the issues we encountered included the cost of running such a process; timing; the independent advice received from PwC; borrower-only bids; the confidentiality of personal information that would be in the public domain; delivering best results for the creditors, including the taxpayer; and the execution risks associated with such a strategy. We confirm that since the commencement of the special liquidation, the residential mortgage holders have continued to enjoy the protection of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and other protections in Irish consumer law. We have established a robust residential mortgages credit committee process and have reviewed mortgage accounts for forbearance, restructuring and enforcement measures. Of the 12,702 mortgage accounts in IBRC, 10,622 relate to mortgages on a borrower’s private dwelling house, PDH. Of the PDH accounts, 4,175 are in arrears. Over the past, year we have been engaging with borrowers to address these arrears. A key development we have achieved to date is that we have concluded restructuring with 38% of the customers in arrears, with a further 6% in the final stages of completion. In addition, we are working towards a solution with 42% of the remaining accounts, which, with borrower co-operation, we will endeavour to deal with before the sales process. We do not currently have sufficient information to devise a solution in respect of 14% of our customers. Further information is being requested from these borrowers with a view to working towards a sustainable solution for them. We are currently making approximately 16,000 customer interactions per month across the full Sand portfolio. Efforts to contact borrowers are via telephone and letters, and we are urging borrowers to re-engage with us and work towards a sustainable solution. We are in monthly contact with in excess of 98% of our customers in arrears. Any IBRC borrower can repay all borrowings with IBRC at any time up to the end of the sales process. The full amount, or par value, of all borrowings outstanding at the time must be repaid. Some concerns have been expressed on the intentions of third-party purchasers of the Sand portfolio. In this context, it is important to note the objective of any third-party purchaser will be to make a financial return on the purchase. It is unlikely that this purpose could be achieved through actions that would make it more, rather than less, difficult for borrowers to comply with the terms of their loan agreements. Third-party purchasers will be required to honour the legal terms of the underlying loan agreements. We can confirm that the third-party bidders who are bidding on the residential mortgage portfolios have confirmed they will be directing that the mortgages be serviced in accordance with the terms of the CCMA should they be successful in acquiring those loans. We are satisfied that the voluntary nature of this arrangement strikes a fair balance between the interests of the mortgage holders as well as the interests of the creditors of IBRC. The sales process for the Sand portfolio is ongoing and it is, therefore, too early to comment on what percentage of it will be sold to third parties or to NAMA at the valuation price. We will continue to work with residential mortgage holders who are in arrears and we are willing to correspond with them pending the sale of the portfolios to third parties or to NAMA to arrive at sustainable solutions for them. I thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for their time. We are now available to take questions on our statement.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	3	They are quite varied in nature.  We have employees who are owed moneys in respect of contractual entitlements and suppliers who were owed money on the date on which the bank went into liquidation.  The most substantial creditor is the State, which will account for approximately 70% of the unsecured creditors of IBRC.  We have our secured creditor, NAMA, which is owed just short of €14 billion.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	4	Between NAMA and the State, what is the percentage in the creditor book?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	5	It is in excess of 70%.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	6	Consequent to last night’s statement, many people in the mix will be very interested in knowing the detail.  What level of supervision can be applied to the voluntary code of practice that was announced in the press statement last evening?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	7	As we said, we have got a voluntary agreement from the potential bidders in regard to the mortgage loans. From our perspective as liquidator, we have been able to get a voluntary agreement, and that is as far as we can go.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	8	Who supervises that? The Central Bank would supervise the banks that fall under the regulator's office. Who supervises this one?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	9	As far as I understand it, the Central Bank would classify the bidders. The names are not known but the majority of the bidders we would be talking to in respect of the portfolio of loans we are talking about today would be unregulated entities, so it would not be an option for the Central Bank to regulate them.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	10	So the Central Bank will not be supervising any of these loans after the sale?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	11	That is my understanding.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	12	That brings me on to the next question. There are resolution targets. The delegation mentioned its own resolution targets in its opening statement. I will return to this later. Under the existing scheme, set out around April of last year, very specific targets were set for the banks. There are percentages of 25%, 35%, 50%, etc. There was a carrot-and-stick approach. The stick approach is that if financial institutions do not meet their targets, capital penalties will apply to them. The loan book being sold contains people with performing mortgages. They may be performing just by their fingertips but there are people in resolution processes, as has been explained. I will go into the detail of the resolution process later. What is the position on the resolution targets pending the sale? If the Central Bank has no role in this matter, how can penalties be applied according to the code of conduct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	13	We are very pleased with the progress that has been made while we have been in the IBRC during special liquidation.  As my colleague Mr. Eamonn Richardson alluded to, by the end of next week we will have effected restructuring deals with 44% of the borrowers in arrears who are co-operating with us.  A further 42% are work in progress.  We are actively encouraging those in this category to continue to co-operate with us so we can have restructuring deals done for them over the coming weeks.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	14	That is not the question I am asking. Mr. Wallace referred to the current state of play and said that following the sale of the loan book, a voluntary code of practice will apply, but I am saying the current resolution process for people in Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB involves very specific targets which, if not met, result in the application of penalties by the Central Bank. Capital reserves must be adjusted, for example. Will any penalties apply to the new institutions? It is critical that people in difficulty be put into a resolution process. What gatekeeping exists to ensure the targets will be met by the new financial institution?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	15	I am not aware of any.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	16	Is there no structure for the resolution process and are no targets in place for the period after the sale?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	17	Any restructured deals we agree to prior to the completion of the sale will involve a contractual term within our sales documents. Any buyer will have to honour those restructured deals.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	18	Following the sale of the loan book, will homeowners be in a position to transfer their loan from the new financial institution to an institution subscribing to the code of conduct and subject to regulation by the Central Bank?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	19	All I can say is that ours is not the first loan book sold in the State. As far as I am aware, there have been two others. I know of circumstances in which borrowers have been able to buy out their loans from the new purchaser. The issue is outside our control.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	20	Let me move on to the Department of Finance.  The statement issued last evening by the liquidator claims all the parties now in phase 2 agree on abiding by the voluntary code of conduct.  In earlier comments by the Minister and the Department, there seems to have been concern about the rating in terms of the creditors' best interests and distortion with regard to the value of the book on the basis of having some people in a box and others outside it.  Given that everyone in phase 2 has accepted the voluntary code of conduct, it creates equalisation with regard to the purchasing of the loan book.  Does this present a legislative impediment that would be damaging to the creditors?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	21	First of all, I would like to welcome the fact that all the bidders have said they will voluntarily abide by the code. As regards possible future legislation, last week in the Dáil the Minister said he hoped they would voluntarily abide by the code. However, we are in discussions with the Central Bank and the Attorney General on whether we can extend the legislation. It is quite complex because a lot of different legal contracts were entered into between different people at different times. The Minister is absolutely determined that the code of conduct will apply. We will certainly be watching the space. If the bidders who eventually purchase them do not abide by what they have committed to do, the Minister has said he will legislate as necessary.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	22	I need to thrash this out with Ms Nolan again, if she does not mind.  The earlier argument was that creditors would be at a disadvantage if we were to legislate for a code that would have devalued the book.  Because everybody has now signed up to the voluntary code, there is no negative impact on the loan book.  Putting aside the fact that the State is the major creditor, what is the impediment from a creditor's perspective?  Is there a creditor impediment that would stop a legislative framework being put around this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	23	We only got this information last night and I have not spoken to the Attorney General's office on whether there would still be an impediment in legal terms. I cannot give legal advice on that issue but it is unlikely, given that this process is now half-way or three quarters way through, that we would have legislation to go through in that period, even if we had it ready. The fact is there are legal complexities and this is not necessarily the only book that would be sold. We are looking at legislation, as the Minister said. The creditor position is obviously changed by the commitment.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	24	Would Ms Nolan admit that the creditor position has changed quite radically now that everyone is on the same hymn sheet in terms of purchasing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	25	It is certainly a huge improvement and we very much welcome it.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	26	Mr. Wallace referred to the people in resolution processes. When the banks' representatives appeared before this committee, they told us that thousands of people were in resolution processes but we discovered that the resolution process was a letter telling people to engage with the banks. I would be interested to know what Mr. Wallace's resolution processes are. For instance, how many people in that book are in split mortgages or structured resolutions, rather than just written correspondence?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	27	I do not have the specific numbers with me, but there are a number who are on split mortgages, a number where we have recapitalised the interest on their accounts, and a number where we have extended the term of their actual mortgage vis-à-vis the number of years for repayment.  There are a number where we have given moratoria whereby they do not have to pay for a period when they find themselves in temporary difficulty.  We have also done some trade-down solutions for people wanting to move from a certain size of house to another house to alleviate some of the problems with their mortgage.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	28	I want to move on to another matter.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	29	I am sorry, Chairman, but can we have those data?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	30	I will be happy to supply those after the meeting. No problem.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	31	An earlier point concerned somebody who may wish to switch financial institutions. The audit committee members will be referring to this in their own questions. The concern for people on the existing mortgage loan book is that they are in performing mortgages, albeit by their fingernails. Am I correct in stating that everyone currently in a performing mortgage on the book Mr. Wallace is dealing with is on a variable interest rate? There is no one on a tracker mortgage or a fixed rate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	32	We have a very small number of tracker mortgages.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	34	Fewer than 100 mortgages out of the total book.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	36	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	38	That is a risk with any financial institution.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	40	That is a risk, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	42	We have 4,175 accounts which are in arrears from a total of roughly 10,700 PDH mortgages. Of that 4,175, approximately 3,270 are co-operating with us, as Mr. Richardson said. We correspond on a monthly basis with approximately 98% to 99% of all borrowers in arrears, but about 22% are not corresponding with us at all.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	43	Are they people who are not responding to any engagement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	44	They are not responding to any engagement whatsoever.  Of the 78% who are corresponding with us, by the end of next week we will have restructures done for 44% of those borrowers.  Some 42% is work in progress where we are actively encouraging borrowers to work with us to resolve their restructure.  We are still waiting for information from 14% of those borrowers to progress the restructure.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	45	The people who are not engaging with the special liquidators could be doing so for 101 different reasons. Is Mr. Wallace indicating that half the 74% group are currently in a resolution process and the other half are due to come to some structured resolution?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	46	Some 38% of them are through the resolution process and restructures have been agreed. A further 6% have been signed off by the credit committee and we will be communicating with those borrowers over the coming week to ten days. Some 42% are at some stage of the resolution process but are not fully through it.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	47	If they have not completed their resolution process pending the sale of the bank, who will continue the resolution process with them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	48	We are actively encouraging those borrowers to work with us. We still have over two months before any sale is completed. We still have plenty of time for those borrowers to work with us and get the resolutions completed. We are actively encouraging them to work with us to get those resolutions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	50	We have said that any borrower in IBRC, which is governed by the IBRC Act, can repay their debt at par. It is just the level of the debt that is outstanding. At the moment, just over 400 mortgage borrowers have repaid us in full.

We held a competitive tender, including interviews with each of the potential candidates.  Based on experience and cost, we went with PwC.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	65	I was going to say that it is not worth the paper it is written on. It appears, however, that it will not be written on any piece of paper so I am not sure what value that puts on it. Mr. Wallace has been put in the firing line here today, but this is as much a political issue as it is one for the special liquidators. I will take up those issues with Ms Nolan as she is representing the Minister who, unfortunately, cannot attend this meeting.The bottom line is that thousands of IBRC mortgage holders now feel they will be at the mercy of an unregulated, unsympathetic, potentially foreign-owned fund which is out to maximise the profit it can make from the mortgages those people took out in good faith from an Irish financial institution, regulated by the Irish Central Bank. They will find themselves completely exposed, isolated and vulnerable to whatever that particular fund decides to do with their mortgages. That is where those people find themselves as a result of the way this process has been handled. Does Mr. Wallace have any comment on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	66	I understand those concerns entirely from individual mortgage holders. Indeed, Mr. Richardson and I have spoken to many of them directly. As liquidators, we have a job to do, which is to sell the assets for the best price we can for the benefit of the creditors, which I alluded to already. The only other thing I would say is that this is not the first mortgage book that has been sold in Ireland. Our experience on the ground is that we have seen no material difference in the way the buyers of those books have dealt with and handled customers post-acquisition than with any existing Irish bank.

Is there any evidence to suggest they would actually pay less to the special liquidator for the IBRC mortgage book where it was a binding condition of the sale that they would have to comply with the statutory code?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	68	It is our professional view that if it were a binding term, that could have an impact on value.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	70	Unfortunately, we have not got the bids in from the bidders at this point in time.  There is still a reality to the possibility that the loans will transfer to NAMA.  As everyone understands, NAMA has a backstop position in respect of the IBRC liquidation.  It is not a foregone conclusion that these loans will go to outside buyers.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	71	We now have two different standards of protection for Irish mortgage holders who took out a mortgage from an entity in Ireland regulated by the Central Bank in respect of their family home.  We are not discussing investment properties but family homes.  We now have a vista in which we have two different standards of protection.  If one is a customer of AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB or Ulster Bank, one has the full protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, if one had taken out one's mortgage with the former Irish Nationwide, one will now have a completely different standard of protection which is entirely discretionary and can be removed at any time by the new holder of one's mortgage, if that ends up being an unregulated entity.  The issue is that even if the funds say they are compliant, a dispute may arise.  If one is in difficulty with one's mortgage and the fund says it is complying with the code of conduct and offering various restructuring options, to whom does one turn to if one disagrees?  One cannot go to the Central Bank, which has nothing to do with it and one cannot go to the Department of Finance, which also has nothing to do with it.  One cannot go to the special liquidator, which will have got its fees and be gone.  Who do people turn to?  They have nowhere to turn.  That is morally bankrupt and completely unacceptable.  It is as much a political issue as it is one for the special liquidator.  Even with the voluntary compliance that these funds say they will adopt, what will happen if they sell on the mortgage book?  That is what they do.  They will not necessarily work out each of these mortgages for the next 15 to 20 years.  They may well sell this on.  That commitment will be sold on with it and will be gone.  Has that issue been discussed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	72	That is an issue that would not come up in terms of the work we are doing. As we are working with a number of defined bidders for the portfolio, the concept of selling on has not arisen.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	73	Can Ms Nolan confirm that irrespective of the intentions of any unregulated fund that might hold the mortgages, there will be no access to the ombudsman for the IBRC mortgage holders? It is a statutory issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	74	I understand it will not apply if the buyer is a non-regulated entity. They will not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman. It is another matter we are considering in the Department at the moment. I understand the two purchasers of the existing portfolios of mortgages that have previously been sold on the Irish market have established an internal, independent appeals procedure which they are using for people who wish to appeal where they have a problem with their mortgage. We will ask whoever purchases these mortgages to do the same. We are reviewing this issue in the legislative review that we are carrying out.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	75	It is a major issue, as the Financial Services Ombudsman is the statutory watchdog for Irish consumers who have complaints about financial products sold to them. That avenue will be completely closed off for IBRC mortgage holders who will have their mortgages sold by the special liquidator. There is a serious vacuum in the law which must be addressed urgently. I revert to how this issue arose in the first place. We know from parliamentary questions that the Department of Finance was in contact with KPMG as prospective special liquidator for IBRC as far back as autumn 2012, which was several months before the Minister came to the Dáil in February 2013 with emergency legislation to appoint the special liquidators. Did anyone think of this issue and the mortgage holders and of ensuring that these basic but vital statutory protections would be retained in the circumstance of the bank being liquidated? Why was that not factored into the sale process following the appointment of the liquidator?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	76	It was very important for legal reasons that the sales process was independent and that the other creditors of IBRC would not have recourse to the State.  We did not do anything that would impinge on the value of the assets as they were being sold as the taxpayer would otherwise be left liable for quite a considerable sum of money.  The question of public policy on the protection of mortgage holders is a separate one in respect of which we are looking at legislation.  It is not as part of the sales process of IBRC loans.  Any legislation we bring forward is likely to apply to any sales process of any loans and unlikely to apply exclusively to the IBRC loans.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	77	What Ms Nolan is saying is in fact worse.  She is saying the issue was considered but a decision was taken not to insist that these mortgage holders would be left in no better or worse position.  The Department felt that insisting these protections be retained might diminish the value of the loan book and so decided to exclude them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	78	No. What I am saying is that as part of the IBRC liquidation, we dealt only with the value of the assets being sold. In terms of protection for the individual mortgage holders, at the time we introduced the legislation, it seemed most likely these mortgages would go to NAMA. I understand that now there are other bidders. That is not exactly what we expected at the time. We would require NAMA to apply the consumer protection code to any consumers. The question of sales of mortgages is a broader one that encompasses more than just the IBRC. It has to do with the mortgage contract. It is obviously preferable that all of the protections of the State apply to these customers, but it is also important not to put ourselves in a position in which we are implying they will have no protection at all. They are governed by the mortgage agreements they have signed and they will be governed by any restructuring agreement they sign with KPMG or have already signed with IBRC before the liquidation. It is not the case that these customers are left with no protections at all. The legal position is that the courts have asked anyone who has gone to court over a mortgage case whether the consumer protection codes applied or not. The courts will retain the right to ask that question. It is specifically provided for in the insolvency legislation that people have rights under the consumer protection code.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	79	Ms Nolan knows as well as I do the conditions of a contract of sale of a mortgage.If anyone looks at their mortgage document and if that is the limit of their protection, it is apparent that it is skewed heavily in favour of the lender. Essentially, if one gets into any level of difficulty with a mortgage, it can be called in at any time. That is why a statutory code of conduct was put in place. It was to allow breathing space for a borrower, as well as putting an obligation on the bank to work with a customer to come up with solutions to be worked out over a period. To claim the new mortgage owner will step into the shoes of the bank and that the same conditions will apply is no comfort to that person with a mortgage. If these funds do come into possession of these mortgages, have there been any discussions with them about interest rate policy? Another concern people have is that these funds are not subject to oversight in Ireland or do not come under any competitive pressures. Accordingly, the organisations involved could just jack up the interest rates.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	80	Mr. Richardson and I will be making it binding through the contracts that any restructurings that have already been agreed with customers will be honoured by the buyer of the loan. There have been no discussions about interest rates for the practical reason that we are still in the bidding phase for these mortgage books. Those detailed discussions on interest rates and other issues will only arise when we get down to more final discussions with the preferred bidder.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	81	In the opening statement, it was stated:Thirty three of the borrower groups [in the IBRC loan book] representing 0.2% of total groups are being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis.  No IBRC borrower is being provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back their loans at a discount.How many IBRC borrowers actually bought back their loans?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	82	It is quite interesting.  Not all of these individual loan sales have completed, and of the ones that have completed, there have been quite a number in which the borrower was not the successful party.  The competitive tension in the bidding process has actually meant an additional return for the creditors, liquidation and, indeed, a different buyer in respect of those loans.  It is not a foregone conclusion by any means.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	83	My question was about how many cases there have been in which the original borrower bought back the loan, presumably at a substantial discount. I am referring to the large commercial debtors of IBRC.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	84	I do not have the exact number but it is around 60% of the sales that have been concluded within the 33 borrower groups.

It has been made a condition that any bidder must honour restructuring arrangements already agreed. If it were made a condition of sale that they must comply legally with the code of conduct for mortgage holders, what would be the difference in value?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	88	There would be a difference in value. One of the fundamental principles we must work by as the liquidators of IBRC, under law, is to be able to get the best price and value for IBRC’s assets. If we did not, we would be open to legal action by creditors of IBRC. Where there is any question over any impact on the value achieved, that leaves us open to legal recourse.

In the event that loans in Project Stone could not be sold, could the liquidators re-engage with the borrowers who previously expressed an interest in buying their loans where these borrowers are in a position to make fully funded bids within a set time frame prior to the transfer of these loans to NAMA?  I welcome the fact that the preferred bidders for the residential mortgages with IBRC have agreed to be bound by the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears. Can Mr. Richardson confirm that all the preferred bidders for the commercial loans will also agree to be bound by the code of conduct for business lending to small and medium-sized enterprises as issued by the Central Bank? What protection will be afforded to borrowers with residential investment properties? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	117	Project Stone commenced phase two on 17 February 2014 so we are currently in a five-week process with the preferred bidders. Final bids on that portfolio of loans are due on 21 March 2014. We are in the middle of phase two of that particular process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	119	Within the legislation, we run a sales process.  If our bids are in excess of the valuation price, they are sold to that third party.  If we do not receive any bids in respect of a portfolio above the valuation price, it is transferred to NAMA at the valuation price.

If they all reach resolutions with the special liquidators before the sales process is completed, they will have additional protections.  This is as much a question for the special liquidators as it is for the Department of Finance.  Would I be right in saying that there is nothing to stop us legislating subsequently to give more protection to those people if it is necessary?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	123	As I have said, we are looking at legislation. The legislation would not be specific to those people but would apply to anyone whose loan was sold. It would be difficult to pass legislation specific to particular loan groups. Passing legislation for contracts that already exist is quite a complex business but we are talking to the Attorney General and that is what we would have in mind. It would be extra protection and would give them the same protection that other people have.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	125	The Minister's preferred option would be that at least initially people would abide by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears regardless of whether or not they are covered by it. We are very pleased that they have agreed to do that because that is the first protection of the people because loans will be transferred within the next few months.

It is said that around 900 borrowers do not seem to have any connection with the special liquidators.  Have they had some or no contact with the special liquidators?  The special liquidators are saying they do not have enough information but are they saying borrowers have had no contact with them?  Is there more to be done?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	127	About 970 borrowers are single-handedly failing to engage with us at all. We engage with 98% or 99% of all borrowers in arrears every month. There are still 971 of those borrowers who simply will not engage with us at all.

I do not doubt they are doing their job properly but how do they answer the question regarding their apparent conflict of interest having been auditors of Irish Nationwide Building Society for so long, having certified its accounts for so long and having signed up to so many improvements that proved to be illusory?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	132	I want to be careful because this is before the courts at the moment. I will say a few things on behalf of myself and Mr. Richardson. We took independent advice following our appointment as to whether there was any rationale in including KPMG in that litigation and the advice from the independent legal firm was "No". One of the directors has now joined KPMG in the litigation. In the coming days, Mr. Richardson and I will be announcing a very different approach in terms of how that litigation will be managed. From a perception viewpoint, we think it important that it is managed by parties other than us. We will be announcing something like that in the coming days.

In respect of the timing of last night's announcement, it could be construed that this was a statement that was going to be put together before the special liquidators came before the committee today.  How long have they been in negotiations with the preferred bidders with regard to a voluntary code of conduct?  We discovered this afternoon that it has no legal standing and that no targets are in place for the people in resolution processes that carry penalties as they do in all the other institutions.  This committee would certainly like to know about the timing of last night's announcement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	134	That is an entirely legitimate question. As Mr. Richardson said, each process for the sale of loans goes through a number of different stages. We have phase one in which we try to determine whether there are any parties interested in acquiring the loans. After that stage 1, we then look to see what kind of values the potential bidders have put on those loans. Where there is an appropriate reason to bring bidders through to phase two, we do that. This is probably one of the more complex books in terms of getting it to market and getting it sold. It was our professional judgement that it was only in the last two weeks that it made sense to engage with the bidders in respect of this issue. We had heard it debated. In our professional judgement, there was no point in doing it prior to that because it was only at that stage that we had some insight as to which bidders were seriously interested in making a bid for the various loan portfolios within this section.

We will not quantify the sum because the special liquidators say it is confidential information. The special liquidators had a list of bidders who were compliant with a voluntary code as of two weeks ago?

We see revelations in the newspapers today to add to the arguments put forward by myself and others that the special liquidators should have taken that course of action.  The special liquidators say they have independent legal advice, which is fine.  Can they tell us the name of the company that gave them that advice?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	142	Yes, I can. To clarify one point, the litigation does not relate to the role of KPMG as auditors to Irish Nationwide Building Society. The firm that gave us the advice is McCann Fitzgerald.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	143	Are the special liquidators aware that McCann Fitzgerald was the same legal adviser on corporate governance to Irish Nationwide for many years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	144	It was the adviser to the new board which was in place in Irish Nationwide and which replaced the old board.  The board took its own independent advice prior to liquidation in respect of who it thought it was appropriate to litigate against in respect of the various issues.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	145	Does Mr. Wallace think that there is not only one conflict of interest but a number of conflicts of interest?  I will summarise it because I want to move on to the mortgage issue.  The special liquidators of IBRC are employees of KPMG who ask whether IBRC should sue KPMG as a result of the auditing of Irish Nationwide accounts carried out by KPMG.  The special liquidators seek independent advice from a legal firm that gave advice to Irish Nationwide on the issues of corporate governance.Does Mr. Wallace not see there could at least appear to be a conflict of interest and that further advice should have been sought? Is he aware that the clock is ticking on the Statute of Limitations and there are only a few weeks left to instigate proceedings?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	146	The litigation to which the Deputy referred was commenced prior to our appointment as special liquidators.  The independent board made an assessment as to who should be joined to the litigation.  It was not our decision.  In regard to the Statute of Limitations, we will shortly be announcing a different arena for managing the litigation, other than by Mr. Richardson and me.  That independent group can make a decision on whether it feels it necessary to include KPMG.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	148	We have been in discussions with the liquidators about putting procedures in place so that they are not making decisions about their own firm, which clearly would be a conflict of interest.  As Mr. Wallace pointed out, the decision not to sue KPMG was made before that firm was appointed as special liquidator.  The decision was made by the independent board not the Department of Finance.  We did not play a day-to-day management role in the running of IBRC before it was liquidated nor do we do so during its liquidation.

I have also put questions to the Minister on it.  In regard to mortgages, the special liquidator expressed the view that the preferred bidders will honour legal agreements and referred to the restructuring that has taken place in IBRC.  Will restructuring agreements affecting individuals with split mortgages or interest only mortgages be regarded as legal agreements?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	150	We will be putting a clause into the contracts to ensure that any restructuring which we carried out or which existed at the time of our appointment as liquidators will be honoured contractually by the buyers of the loans.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	151	I welcome that it is possible to put a clause into the contract on honouring restructuring.  Mr. Wallace indicated that he is legally precluded from interfering with the issue of statutory compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears but I presume that the compliance with restructuring would be done on the basis of a legal agreement in the contract.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	152	The restructuring clause is included in all our sales contracts, whether in respect of commercial and corporate loans or residential loans, because they are agreements that have been entered into in good faith by the borrower and the bank.  We would expect any buyer of a loan to honour those restructuring agreements.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	153	Earlier I met with a number of individuals who had mortgages with IBRC.  They are deeply concerned and quite angry about what is currently happening.  One individual, who is a father of three children, has asked me to outline his situation to the committee.  He has a split mortgage under a restructuring arrangement with IBRC that is reviewed on an annual basis.  According to Mr. Wallace, that restructuring agreement will be enforced with the buyer but the agreement is reviewed annually.  If IBRC rips the agreement up next year and demands the repayment of the full amount, this individual would have recourse to the Financial Ombudsman.  However, the new owner of the mortgage will be able to legally review his contract and decide whatever action it considers appropriate.  What would Mr. Wallace say to this individual about what will happen when the agreement is reviewed next year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	154	I do not know the specifics of that case but I understand the individual's concerns.  The restructuring agreements with IBRC that I have seen certainly extend beyond one year.  Many of them extend to three years, five years or longer.  It is certainly not the norm in the restructuring agreements I have seen.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	155	This was a one year case but the same issue arises for three year agreements. The most Mr. Wallace can say to those concerned is that the bidder will comply with the restructuring until the time of the review, at which point all bets are off and there is no recourse to the Financial Ombudsman.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	156	That is a possibility.

I questioned him about the legality of the agreements and he could not indicate whether they are enforceable under contract law.

Is it possible to have that retrospectively applied?Let us take it that a company, such as Tanager, which bought Bank of Scotland, voluntarily went into the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, unregulated in this State. Can we as legislators apply conditions to a sale that took place last year?

Mr. Mac Donncha is our legal expert here.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	178	Ultimately that would have to be decided by the Attorney General. In so far as legislation prospectively governed the actions of people who had acquired such assets, it is not a foregone conclusion that it could not be applied to people who purchased those assets prior to the legislation coming in. So because the legislation would be prospective, it would not interfere with the conditions of the sale. It is legitimate for the Government to legislate for the actions of people who are in that sort of space. That is why we have a suite of regulation of financial service providers. It would be for the Attorney General to make the final decision but we are not discounting the possibility that it would be possible to so legislate. That is why it is under active exploration.

We know what is happening. These loans are being flipped, and it is not beyond the realms of possibility that these loans will be flipped again in a number of years. What is the standing of the voluntary code of conduct on mortgage arrears in that event?

Has the Department of Finance given any letters of comfort, indemnities or undertakings? Can there be any recourse if the mortgage is not enforceable? My last question is for the Department of Finance regarding Tanager. There are concerns about a conflict of interest. It is well publicised that directors of Tanager, which bought the loan book from Bank of Scotland, are partners of A&L Goodbody, which provided advice to Certus and which was involved in the outsourcing of the loan books. Is there any concern or are any red flags going off within Departments about directors of one company buying loans from Royal Bank of Scotland being partners in another company which provided advice to the bank to sell the loans? I know we are a small country, but are any red flags going off in the Department?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	182	I assure the Deputy that nothing whatsoever - no warranties, indemnities, side letters or letters of comfort - has been given to any purchaser regarding the residential loan books. The legal advice on the sale of the mortgage books was not given by A&L Goodbody.

If it sold the loan book at a knock-down price to somebody - I do not know if it did or not - it is a matter for itself to protect its commercial interest. We have an interest in whether the ultimate purchaser abides by the code of conduct because we have an interest in the individuals who own those mortgages as part of the public interest in how mortgage holders are treated across the board. We have no interest in the price Bank of Scotland got for a mortgage book it sold because there was no commercial interest to the Irish State involved.

The fact that they have been appointed by the State means they also have to look after the citizens of the State. They are trying to get the best price, but there is more at play than that. Ms Nolan has alluded to the fact that in the event that the Minister believes the purchasers are not complying with the code of conduct, the Department will try to put a legal framework in place to protect the mortgage holders. If I were a purchaser of this loan book, that would be built into the value now to begin with, so we are back down to the lower price again. Why not legislate for it now and make them comply with it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	194	The Minister tried to explain this last week in the Dáil.  The issue from our point of view is that we have to protect the position of the taxpayer who has given a guarantee to the Central Bank for nearly €13 billion worth of NAMA bonds on the back of these assets.  We cannot allow that the other creditors could sue us for a potential loss of value, even if that potential loss of value were zero.  If they could make out that it existed and sue us, we could be putting ourselves in the position of having to pay out to other creditors and even the sub-debt holders.

Our job is to get the best price we can for the assets of the bank in liquidation. We have taken independent advice on that and we are following that advice.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	200	None, except that we are also governed by another piece of legislation, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, Act.

This is for the betterment of the individuals of the State.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	202	Yes, but the fundamental principles by which liquidators work and by which they are judged by the creditors, both secured and unsecured, to whom we owe our ultimate obligation, is judged by getting the best value we can for the assets. That is enshrined in the 1963 Companies Act, by which we are also governed.

I have a question regarding securitisation. Most of us are familiar with the concept of packaging a large number of mortgages in Ireland before selling them elsewhere. Where will the operations relating to the mortgages reside going forward?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	204	Our understanding of the bidders that remain in the process is that if they require any of the loan books, they will be serviced here in Ireland.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	205	If they are serviced here in Ireland, would the mortgages not fall under the remit of how securitisation traditionally works here?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	206	I am not an expert in that field.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	207	It is not a securitisation; we are selling the loan book.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	209	The person who will service the loan book will not necessarily be a regulated financial service provider.  The servicing of a loan book in and of itself is not a regulated activity as matters stand.  There are service providers in the market at the moment who are servicing loan books on behalf of other people and because they are not issuing credit on their account, they do not fall under the scope of regulation.  They are acting on behalf maybe of a lender but they are not regulated.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	210	So a loan book could be serviced by somebody within the State on behalf of a lender from outside the jurisdiction, which is not regulated by the Central Bank or the regulator?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	211	If it was a lender from outside the State, which was issuing credit into the State, that would be regulated by the Central Bank but if someone has purchased a loan book and is not a regulated financial service provider, there are other service providers in the market who are not regulated financial service providers and who are in the business of managing those sort of loan books but they do not fall under the regulation of the Central Bank.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	212	That is a grey area that should be cleared up. If they are servicing the loans in this country, they should be compelled to comply with Central Bank regulations. Ms Nolan said that it was not envisaged in the IBRC liquidation that mortgages would be sold on. Could she elaborate on that? I acknowledge that the special liquidators are trying to do the best thing by the taxpayer and get the best price for loan book but they must have been told at the time of the liquidation what the strategy was for the work out of the mortgages. Were they told that the mortgages would not be sold into the market?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	213	No. Let me make it absolutely clear what I said was "it was not expected"; that is different from being envisaged. We knew the loan book was going to the market for sale; we thought it was more likely that it would end up with NAMA. It would be fair to say that the Irish economy has recovered in the past 12 months and the amount of interest in buying Irish assets has improved significantly in the past 12 months. We knew that some of the assets would sell but at the time we liquidated, it was not clear to us that there would be as much interest or that as big a proportion of the assets would sell to the private sector. One of the reasons we put in the NAMA arrangement was to make sure there was not a firesale because that would have left the Irish taxpayer very exposed, but all I said was it would have been our expectation that it was more likely that a bigger proportion of the assets would end up with NAMA than now appears likely.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	214	It would have been appreciated if we, as legislators, on the night had a strategy presented to us.  I understand that it had to be in place before 9 a.m. the following morning.  This is a little reactionary.  Almost 40% of the mortgages the special liquidators are dealing with are distressed.  I am uncomfortable with the notion that somebody can come in and manipulate their mortgages to get the most money they can out of them and we need to put legislation in place to protect them to the best of our ability.  I urge the Department and the liquidators to reconsider the need for legislation.  Given what has been divulged, any valuer would understand that the Minister would legislate if they did not live up to the code of conduct.  To safeguard the mortgages, the legislation should be introduced now rather than waiting for the loans to be sold on and on.  A total of 970 borrowers are not engaging.  Are they all PDH people or are they buy-to-let investors?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	215	They are all PDH.

I refer to the IBRC employees.  I know many of them, as I worked with them when I was in my 20s.  They are in mortgage distress and they have all the problems that my generation is experiencing.  Is it fair that they are being treated the way that they are in the wind down of the bank relative to how the previous employees were treated?  What are the restrictions?  Why has this not been worked out?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	217	We have had great co-operation from the IBRC employees. Their commitment and co-operation over the course of the liquidation has been exemplary. Mr. Richardson and I would like to publicly thank everybody in IBRC, particularly for the hard work they put into getting many of the loan books ready for sale. It has been an outstanding contribution by them. We worked pretty well with most employees over the period of time and we sought on many occasions to extend the contracts of employment with them as long we could. We recently announced an extension until late 2014. The other good news is we have not had occasion yet to make compulsory redundancies in respect of IBRC employees.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	218	However, many of them have been re-employed without being subject to the terms of the normal statutory redundancy process. In addition, they are considered to have started new jobs and do not have entitlements they had built up previously. They have been disadvantaged following the liquidation and that must be acknowledged. I thank Mr. Wallace for acknowledging their hard work because the vast majority of people working for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were hard working and decent and that is not said half often enough. Is there not an injustice that people in the higher echelons who were moved for the purposes of cleaning up the bank were given a lucrative handshake while those who are still there cleaning up the messy loans and doing the hard slog are not being remunerated or looked after properly post-liquidation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	219	We are trying to be as supportive as we can in the context of the liquidation with as many employees as we can and to continue where it is appropriate with employment for those individuals and to make sure that we are very open and transparent with them in respect of the duration of their employment.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	220	We were assured that the employees would be looked after properly on the night of the liquidation.

KPMG was auditor of INBS in the time running up its collapse and KPMG advised the Government that it would have to pay north of €5 billion into the building society.  Mr. Wallace, in reference to himself and Mr. Richardson earlier, stated: "We have no experience selling loan books whatsoever."   He has no electoral mandate obviously to act in the public interest.  Based on that, does he think it is appropriate that he should be making decisions that are harming tens of thousands of Irish citizens?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	222	To which decisions does the Deputy refer?
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	223	Specifically in this case not allowing mortgage holders to bid on their own mortgages.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	224	First, that decision follows independent advice from PwC.  It is not a decision that Mr. Richardson and I made independently.  It was following the receipt of professional advice having appointed independent advisers to provide that information to us.  The other thing is that nowhere in the liquidation of IBRC have we allowed an individual borrower to singularly bid on his or her own loan without competition from another party.That is important to note because I think it is forgotten in the detail. As I said earlier, many of the individual borrowers who have been allowed to bid for their own loans have not been successful in acquiring those loans. Hypothetically if we had decided, after receiving independent advice, that we would allow the borrowers to bid for their own loans, it would have been a quite difficult exercise because we would have had situations-----
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	225	I am sorry to cut across Mr. Wallace. My question is about his suitability rather than the process. KPMG was the auditor of the Irish Nationwide Building Society and gave it a clean bill of health. Mr. Wallace has said he has no experience in selling loan books and he clearly has no elected mandate to look after the public interest. In the context of those three facts, does he believe it is appropriate for him to make decisions that so seriously affect tens of thousands of Irish men, women or children?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	226	Yes, I do.  In many cases liquidators go into a business where they have no prior experience.  I am not saying that is an analogy here, but I am saying I think it is wholly and absolutely appropriate that we would make decisions based on advice from experts in a given field.  The sale of the loan book that we are discussing is one aspect of the overall liquidation; it is not the entire liquidation itself.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	227	I thank Mr. Wallace.  I come to the voluntary adherence to the CCMA.  Mr. Wallace will be very familiar with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, a copy of which I have here.  I am sure he will be familiar with the sentence in Chapter 1 as follows: "Lenders are reminded that they are required to comply with this Code as a matter of law."  At today's committee meeting we have learned that the IBRC or Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders, rather than being protected by law as is the case under the CCMA, will be protected by a voluntary agreement that has no supervision, no Central Bank involvement, no sanctions, nothing in writing, no guarantee that mortgage holders can buy out their own loans and no access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Does Mr. Wallace believe that mortgage holders should be satisfied with the voluntary agreement the special liquidators have secured on their behalf?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	228	That only applies in circumstances where the acquirers of mortgage books are unregulated entities.  Mr. Richardson and I are not involved in the legislative aspect of the country.  We can simply do the best we can in the circumstances, being conscious that our ultimate objective is to get the best price we can for the assets of the bank.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	229	I appreciate that. I have just read back over part of the special liquidators' opening statement which stated: "We are satisfied that the voluntary nature of this arrangement strikes a fair balance between the interests of the mortgage holders as well as the interests of the creditors of IBRC." The creditor essentially is the State, the majority shareholder. Given the protections under law guaranteed by this code compared with a non-existent gentleman's agreement that no one is willing to write down, that has no oversight, no sanction and no enforceability, does Mr. Wallace believe that the Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders would be satisfied with that agreement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	230	I understand there is a difference between both.

Earlier, Mr. Wallace stated that it was his professional view that if it was a binding agreement it would lower the sale price. If bidders would lower their sales price if it was a binding agreement then they are de facto not serious about the voluntary agreement because they are lowering their sales price only because they will be forced to comply with this so-called non-existent voluntary agreement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	238	There may be a slight subtlety in that. We have independent advice that if we made it a compulsory term of the sales contract it would impact value. From that perspective it opens up a potential issue for Mr. Richardson and me, as liquidators.

However, in the past hour Mr. Wallace told this committee that it is his professional view that if these bidders were asked to sign a binding agreement rather than a gentleman's spoken agreement, it would lower the sales price. Does he believe it is reasonable therefore to infer that they are not serious about the voluntary agreement if they are saying they will pay less if they are forced to comply with the voluntary agreement?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	242	The Deputy is mixing two things together.  First, we have professional independent advice that if we made it a compulsory term, it would impact on value which creates an issue for us, as liquidators.  Having parked that to one side, what we tried to do - and achieved yesterday evening following two weeks of discussion with the potential bidders - was to get a voluntary agreement to the commitment to comply with the CCMA.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	243	I thank Mr. Wallace. The special liquidators' opening statement stated:In this context it is important to note that the objective of the third party purchasers will be to make a financial return on their purchase. [We agree on that.] It is unlikely that this purpose could be achieved through actions which would make it more, rather than less, difficult for borrowers to comply with the terms of their loan agreements.I put it to Mr. Wallace that in many cases that is rubbish. Let me give him an example. Let us consider a mortgage in arrears where there is equity in the house. Many of the domestic banks are offering split mortgages, which comes at a cost to the lender. If, as I agree, these hedge funds and whoever else is bidding are looking to make a financial return, then they are likely to evict the family, take possession of the house and secure their equity. Is that a reasonable assertion?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	244	Not if we have done a restructured deal with the borrowers prior to the sale and the borrowers ensure that they adhere to the terms of that restructure.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	246	That is a possibility.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	248	The Deputy cut me off a while ago when I was trying to start to explain that issue.  In the opening statement we alluded to a number of issues which we have taken into account following independent advice on whether we would be in a position to allow mortgage holders to bid on their loans.  Even if we decided to go down that road, there are two practical issues, parking all the other issues that have come into our decision-making process, as to whether we could contemplate individual mortgage holders bidding for their own loans.  First, across the entire portfolio of IBRC loans we have, less than 0.2% of the total of borrowers have had the opportunity to bid for their own loans.  They have bid for their own loans in a very competitive environment, allowing other qualified bidders in to bid for those loans at the same time.  We have had no examples right across any book - nor will we have any examples - where individual borrowers will be the only party bidding for their loan because that does not allow Mr. Richardson and me to fulfil our duty of getting - and standing over getting - best price.  Second, even if we got down to the point of allowing individual borrowers to bid for their own loans, parking everything else to one side, we would have a range of practical issues to deal with.  Let us consider the hypothetical case of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy with their home on a particular road in a particular suburb of Dublin.  All the information would then be available to anybody who actually qualifies as a qualified bidder - it is not that difficult to qualify as such.  They would be able to go in and look at all of the information regarding Mr. and Mrs. Murphy's home, their payment records, the amount of the mortgage, the level of their arrears, when they stopped paying and all of the details around their mortgage.  We believe an incredible range of practical difficulties would arise even if we got to the point of getting the advice indicating it is practical to allow individual mortgage holders to bid for their own loans.

That is an eminently achievable auction process. Was any effort made to model that auction process?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	250	Consideration was given, as we had in any of the portfolios we had put for sale, as to whether there was room for individual borrowers to be placed on their own in a separate tranche. That consideration was given here, as we did in respect of any portfolio. As we indicated in our opening statement, we corresponded with every mortgage holder prior to commencing the sales process. We received 1,224 responses, and Mr. Richardson and I, along with PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, personnel, read them and took them into account in forming final views on how this portfolio should be sold.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	251	On the basis that many of the replies from the individual mortgage holders asked for the opportunity to bid on their own mortgage - the mortgage holders are in no way being allowed to do so - how exactly did the witnesses take the feedback into account in designing the process?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	252	There were not as many as the Deputy might think who sought to put in bids for their mortgages. We took a number of issues into account, including the cost of running a process, timing and independent advice from PwC. Nowhere else in the process had we a position where only the borrower would bid for the loans. We had to account for confidentiality of personal information and execution risk in following through the process. I do not want to harp on about it but we also had an obligation to get best price for assets from a company loan perspective.

I will give an example of a gentleman who has been outside the gates of Leinster House and was keen to see the witnesses this afternoon.  He owes €220,000 on his family home and is in arrears of €20,000.  I assert that the non-performing loans - the example I give is one - could be sold for a discount of 50%.  We do not know if that is the case and the witnesses cannot say, but they could easily be sold at a 50% discount based on international prices for these types of loan books.  This person's home is in positive equity but he cannot pay the €220,000 mortgage.  It is likely that his mortgage will be sold to a hedge fund for approximately €110,000 and the fund, as it is completely unregulated, is likely to knock on his door or write to him informing him of an intention to initiate repossession proceedings.  It is likely that he, his wife and his children will be evicted from that home.  The special liquidators could have designed a process that sold him and his wife their mortgage for €110,000 or even more than the price that will be agreed with the random hedge fund that buys such things.  He would stay in his house along with his wife and children.  What can the witnesses say to him and the thousands of other mortgage holders looking at that type of scenario?

If there is time we can revisit the PwC report in the next round.  I appreciate the Chairman's indulgence.  Mr. Wallace is in a very tough position and in the same way I believe the liquidators are hanging 13,000 Irish families out to dry, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, conspicuous by his absence, is hanging the liquidators out to dry.  They are not helping themselves as they have made the wrong decision, which will cause much unnecessary pain and suffering in this country.  If we have time later, we can come back to the fact that the liquidators have refused to release a redacted version of the PwC report to the committee.

Whether the people are with IBRC, Irish Nationwide, Ulster Bank or AIB, there is a difficulty in trying to get refinanced in order to buy a loan and get out of an existing mortgage.  There may be a coterie of people who can find the financing and the liquidators could have dealt with such a group.  Was there an expression of interest from people who wished to buy the mortgages?

I understand the liquidators are operating for a political boss or master in the form of the Minister for Finance but I am not surprised they are therefore throwing vulnerable home owners to the wolves. That is often done with workers, for example, when companies are liquidated as workers are often the last to be looked after. Who are the current bidders in the process for the approximately 13,000 mortgages?

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	331	The witnesses have justified their approach to this by saying they have a legal imperative to get the best value for the IBRC mortgage book and that if it was a condition of the sale that the purchaser was forced to sign up to the consumer code, MARP and so forth, it would potentially impact on what they might be willing to pay and therefore the public would not get the best value. Is that not essentially their argument?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	332	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	334	No, but we have taken advice from PwC.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	336	No.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	338	It is not speculation. It is advice we received from our independent adviser.

Is there not a big contradiction between that assertion, which has informed the witnesses' approach to this, and simultaneously trying to claim that a voluntary commitment, with no legal standing, is something from which we and the mortgage holders should take comfort? At one point the witness said he would stake his reputation on it. If they are voluntarily willing to abide by the codes and regulations, why would obliging to them to do so make any difference to what they are willing to pay for the mortgages?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	340	That is a question for them-----

They cannot have it both ways. They cannot tell us that if they forced them to comply with the consumer code and MARP, it would affect the purchase price they might be willing to pay and on the other hand say they will voluntarily do it anyway, so we need not worry and that nobody has anything about which to be concerned.The two things do not add up. Does Mr. Wallace not accept that there is a major contradiction in these two things?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	342	No, I do not.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	344	The Deputy must park the two things separately for a moment.  We have taken independent advice on setting up the sales process and how to manage that sales process for the mortgage side of IBRC.  We took the advice from PwC's loan portfolio team.  There were a number of different parties within the first phase of this particular sales process but the issue becomes even more pertinent in the second phase because it did not apply to some of the parties in the first phase.  The advice that we have taken says that if we include it as a definitive term then it will impact on value.  That is a very live issue for us.  Two weeks ago there was a case in the US where the judge refused to confirm a particular sale regarding IBRC because he thought there was better value available in respect of that sale.  It is a pertinent issue for us, as liquidators, that we get best value.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	345	The delegation cannot quantify what the difference in value is, yet they are telling us there is no difference at all from the point of view of the mortgage holders. That is what Mr. Wallace has implied because last night, in the late hours of the night, they had not signed up to some voluntary commitment. That is a big contradiction. It cannot be both things. Either the assurances Mr. Wallace has tried to give are worth nothing or it would have made no difference whatsoever if it had been made a condition of the sale that the purchaser had to sign up to the code.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	346	We have had two weeks of discussions with the bidders.  We would not have done that if we thought it meant nothing.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	348	I am not going to put a number on the table but there is a material difference and that came from the advice that we got from PwC.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	349	It does not add up but I have made my point. I seek clarification on the issue of the mortgage holders being allowed to buy back their own mortgages in or around the same sort of discount the vulture capitalists will get when they purchase the mortgage books. Mr. Wallace has said it would have been too costly, taken too much time and so on to do it that way. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	350	No, I do not think that is a fair reflection of what I said. I said that cost and timing came into the decision-making process, but I do not want to go over old ground. I am speaking from the perspective of ensuring Mr. Richardson and I can stand behind our obligations as liquidators. Therefore, we have not allowed any individual borrower to be the only party bidding for their own loans. There is competitive tension in the less than 0.2% of all the loans of IBRC that we have allowed to be put out on their own as individual loan sales. We have not, in any particular party of IBRC, allowed an individual borrower to be the only party bidding for their loan.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	362	I have not said that. I am saying that cost is a factor. There are a combination of factors, including the independent advice we received from PwC, the team that is in this business every week; the timing of trying to achieve a situation where individual mortgage holders are bidding for their own loans; the practicalities around the disclosure of information and confidentiality; the execution risk; getting best price; and the cost involved in trying to run such a process. Quite a number of factors went into the overall decision as to whether we could entertain individual mortgage holders and allow them to bid for their own loans.

One of those issues was getting the agreement yesterday evening. The second issue, as I said earlier, is to encourage borrowers to co-operate and to get the information to us in order that we can get restructured deals done with those borrowers prior to sale.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	369	Mr. Wallace has admitted there are review clauses spanning one year, three years or whatever in their contracts where the new purchaser could review a restructuring arrangement that might have agreed and, potentially, just tear it up.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	370	That is incorrect. I am saying it depends on the circumstances of each and every borrower as to what restructure plan they agree with the bank. Many of the plans I have seen are well in excess of 12 months.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	372	I would have said that less than 12 months is the exception rather than the norm.

My next question is for the Department. Does it accept that mortgage holders have significant reason for anxiety, particularly when one looks at the attitude of banks that are based outside this country? They are not the banks we bailed out. Those banks have taken a different approach to the loans they own. They have displayed an attitude of getting whatever money they can regardless of the consequences for the person who had the loan and in a way that is not true because of the political and public pressure that might be on banks based here.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	374	I would not have the information that would allow me to draw the conclusion that there is an enormous difference between banks that are based outside of Ireland and those within Ireland. The same Central Bank rules apply across the board for all mortgage protection and to all banks whether they operate inside or outside of Ireland. I understand that where the loans are sold, there is an issue and we talked about it earlier. For banks themselves, the same legal protections apply regardless of whether those banks have been bailed out by the Irish Government.

Too many redacted documents are coming to committees of the Oireachtas, which is an elected Parliament. We have received them on health and on the insurance industry. We are a Parliament and a Legislature and I think it is unlawful for Mr. Wallace to refuse to disclose information to people who have been elected to represent the people in this case.

The same set of accountants were involved, with PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing the Bank of Ireland, Ernst & Young auditing EBS and Anglo Irish Bank, and KPMG auditing Allied Irish Banks and Irish Life & Permanent, Postbank Ireland Limited and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  All of them are under scrutiny by the authority in charge of regulating the area.  People are their CVs and when there are CVs like this, they should not have been on the list.

It is a €7 billion par value book and the advice of PwC was instrumental in allowing us to get the book sold.  It was sold entirely on the open market and it was a good success for the taxpayer.  PwC has done a very good job working on that and assisting us in ensuring a transparent and good sales process for the loans.

At this stage, their advice is useless given the source. If they had been awake in 2008, along with other firms mentioned, we would not be in this situation. There are a lot of books to be written on the inner circle of closed accountancy firms in this city. I am appalled by what I hear.

These bidders have been asked for this commitment because they are based outside the country. Mr. Wallace was satisfied as to their bona fides but we know what is happening in this country with venture capitalists. Ireland has become a magnet for international hedge funds. They see pickings here and come in like vultures and sell on. They have no interest in hanging on to loans and being challenged on the commitments they gave to Mr. Wallace. We are also dealing with an unknown quantity, possibly based outside the country, that will not come under the code of conduct to which financial institutions in this country must subscribe. Mr. Wallace indicated to one of the members that he will disclose the bidders at the end but it is meaningless because we will never know the bidders if the loans are sold on at the rate hedge funds can sell them on.

Even if Mr. Wallace can give a legally binding commitment from current bidders, nothing will save them from something else further down the line. This is empty, notwithstanding the two weeks work. It means nothing to these people. We must be straight with people because we are talking about their lives. Mr. Wallace stated that if there was an enforceable stipulation in respect of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, it could put the loan sale at a disadvantage in respect of the sale price. Have any bidders pulled out? I assume the answer is that they have not.

It raises the question of why there must be public outcry for consumer protection for mortgage holders and their family homes and principal residences to come into effect at the 11th hour.  With regard to the new owners of the loan full portfolio when the sales process has been completed, can Mr. Wallace set out the penalties people in arrears might face?  We are talking about an interest rate increase, which is a possibility.  Could there be penalty interest charges?  Are these people on their own if the loans are sold to financial institutions not regulated by the Central Bank?

The liquidators refused to allow the mortgagors to bid for their loans.  As far as I can see, the liquidators are acting illegally by excluding potential bidders.  The normal answer we get is that it is impractical to deal with individual mortgage holders but I cannot understand it because this is untrue.  How is it practical to set up these mortgages in the first place?  It takes a lot more paperwork to set up a mortgage than to pay it off in one go.  The liquidators have shown they can communicate with the mortgage holders because they wrote to them individually in August 2013 and looked for submissions.As far as I can see, all that has to be done is to ask each mortgagee what he or she wishes to bid, to put the lot on a spread sheet and to tot it up to get the mortgagee bids. Will the liquidator act in the best interests of taxpayers and allow all interested bidders to bid or will it continue, as far as I can see, to act illegally by excluding interested bidders?

Some 84% of Evergreen was sold on the open market, which meant we got above the valuation of the individual assets. We were very pleased with the values we had obtained. Today we announced the sale of €7 billion worth of loans at par, again above our independent valuation; therefore, the sales process we are applying across the portfolios is fulfilling our obligation of getting the best price and delivering the best return for the taxpayer and the creditors of IBRC.

The Master of High Court, Mr. Honohan, said we had to look at the reality that many mortgages would be sold in the secondary mortgage market and that we needed to regulate same.

I have been given a couple of questions to ask and have a couple of my own.  Mr. Wallace has acknowledged that PwC was appointed by the liquidator to value the entire loan book. How many of the partners, executives or staff members of PwC appointed by KPMG to conduct the valuations were also partners and senior executives responsible for conducting PwC's Project Atlas - Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc? This report in the middle of September 2008 found that significant security was in place to minimise the bank's loss through default. Anglo Irish Bank management, subsequently relying on this report, told the Government that just €300 million in additional capital was required for the bank. The figure turned out to be €30 billion. When assessing due diligence of who should be appointed for the valuation and loan sale preparation process, did the liquidator take account of past experience in the assessment? Does the liquidator agree that, objectively, it is hugely astonishing that the same people who undertook such an appallingly bad original valuation of Anglo Irish Bank in 2008 were hired again and, presumably, paid millions of euro for the privilege? For how many years was KPMG auditor for Irish Nationwide Building Society, an entity which was subsumed by IBRC and for which KPMG is now the Government appointed liquidator? There is the question which arose in the American courts recently that there was embedded fraudulently charged interest on some of the commercial loans in the Anglo Irish Bank loan book for a long number of years. This has been shown as fact. It was not a once-off case but an experience that was systemic. It implies that any rolled up interest, the subject of such fraudulent charges, contaminates the cumulative loans that are the subject of a sale and that the buyers of such loans are buying loans with toxic or embedded fraudulent charges. How has the liquidator dealt with this issue? People who took out mortgages, whether in the Irish Nationwide Building Society or, to a smaller degree, in what was Anglo Irish Bank, entered into a series of covenants under headings which included the term of the mortgage loan, the amount of the loan, the repayments, the interest charges and their basis. Even though there may have been some small print licence to sell on or securitise these loans, their essence is a relationship extending over 25 years. I agree with Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that when a loan is sold, even if it is performing-----

The entity that currently is INBS is not in liquidation.

That entity acts entirely independently of IBRC in liquidation. Regarding the ---

I said at that time that we would review the work done by the board regarding the cost of funds and the interest which was inappropriately charged.

We are going to wrap up now and while I am taking the wrap-up, I wish to clarify some matters.  I understand that as an official it is not Ms Nolan's duty to give opinions on policy direction and so forth but perhaps she would explain, in legislative terms, what mechanism exempts buyers of mortgages from Central Bank regulation.  What is the mechanism that puts such people outside regulation by the Central Bank?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	475	It is not a question of what puts them outside regulation but rather what puts them under regulation. The Central Bank Acts puts them under regulation but if they are not a regulated entity under those Acts, then they are not in regulation as such. If one buys a loan and one is not a regulated entity, then one falls outside the scope of regulation, as I understand it.

I ask the witnesses to clarify an issue for me.  Let us take a resolution or restructuring process which results in a contractual arrangement between borrower and lender, that is, a legal agreement.  Where does that legal agreement stand at the other side of the sale?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	483	Again, I wish to give a commitment that in any sale process we go through with any third party we will be asking that third party to acknowledge and comply with any restructuring arrangements that we made with borrowers in IBRC.

Let us take a person who has a property worth €300,000, with €100,000 of that in security against a loan from IBRC. A payment of €60 per week is being made, as part of a deferred resolution process. The person in question is retired with no means of resolving the debt. The person is paying €60 per week and has permission to stay in his home. IBRC will take what it is owed when the person dies or the house is sold. That is the contractual arrangement in place at the moment. What is the status of that contract?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	485	Regarding any terms that have been agreed with a borrower to restructure a loan by a credit committee in IBRC - which is the normal process by which such agreements are made - we will be inserting a clause into the sales contract asking the buyers of those loans to commit to ---

At other side of the sale, there is the contractual nature of the sale of the actual loan.  It was implied that the purchasers of loans could adopt a belligerent attitude which could affect people adversely because they are on variable rate mortgages.  Most variable interest rate loans are tied, somewhat, to the ECB rate.  The rates tend to move around that space.  If we saw a departure from that general approach to the variable interest rates being applied on the current loan book that is being sold and there was an increase of 1% or 2% with no material change in the ECB rate, that could be deemed to be very belligerent behaviour by the purchaser.  Ms Nolan indicated that such behaviour might give rise to legislative action, not on the sale itself but on how the contract is operating.  Is my understanding correct here?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	493	I was talking about the CCMA but the CCMA does not cover interest rates.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	495	I do not have enough insight into the actual contractual interest rates that Irish Nationwide, which is the originator of most of these loans, had in place.  I am not clear as to what conditions exist that would allow the purchaser of the loans to increase interest rates.  Obviously, it would be a matter of concern if a very aggressive line was taken but I could not speak to whether or what we could or should do about that or whether ---

I thought the situation was that action could not be taken on the actual sale of the loans but that we could look, from a legal perspective, at how the loans were being operated.  In other words, the operational rather than the sale aspects of the loans could be examined
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	497	As a general principle, there are no legal rules about what interest rates people can charge on loans.  Banks can charge different interest rates for different loans, depending on the risk appetite, the length of the loan, the financial position of the borrower and so forth.  Indeed, there are non-banks which also charge different interest rates for different types of loans.  There is usually something governing the interest rates in the loan agreements themselves but there is no legislation governing interest rates on loans.

I will put it to Ms Nolan. Yesterday evening's announcement that everybody in the phase 2 bidding process is in verbal agreement to adhere to a voluntary code of conduct means there is a flat-line position between all of the phase 2 bidders, even if we might not call it a level playing field. Does this change the Department's thinking about the legal advice it received previously regarding imposing conditions on the sale that would have an adverse effect on the value of the loan book? Now that everybody is actually in that space, has it been considered that it could be possible to put a legislative framework around this that would not have an adverse effect on creditors?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	499	As I said earlier, if we put a legislative framework into this space, it is likely that it will not be specific to the IBRC. Indeed, there would be no particular reason for legislation to apply to these loans but not to other loans that might be sold in the Irish market.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	500	Could Ms Nolan flesh that out for me so I can understand it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	501	Bank of Scotland (Ireland), for example, sold its mortgage book.  Its mortgagees, or the individuals who own those mortgages, are entitled to the same protection as IBRC mortgagees will be entitled to.  It would be quite unusual to have bespoke legislation for this sale and not for other sales.  I cannot see any particular reason to change the legislation on the sale of loan books in such a way.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	503	That would be the sort of approach we would be looking at.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	539	The development number is 12,702.

The number of customers would be slightly smaller than that.  The customer could have two accounts in some cases.  I would also like to ask about development bonds for residential developments that the IBRC held at the point of liquidation.  Have the liquidators quantified the cumulative value of those bonds?  How many such bonds exist?  I know this has been raised in the House during a Topical Issue debate.  Parliamentary questions have also been asked.  The liquidators are in discussions with the Department and the local authorities.  I am not sure we have a handle on the potential exposure of local authorities for bonds in respect of unfinished developments.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	541	The bond exposure is in excess of €60 million.

We are working with the local authorities to try to get an estimate of how much we think their exposure is likely to be, as distinct from the figure of €60 million.  That is why the Deputy has got such vague answers in response to some parliamentary questions

How has that worked out since the appointment of the special liquidators?  Where stands the interaction between their role as receivers for certain assets and their role as special liquidators under the legislation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	564	The Deputy is correct to suggest that there are certain circumstances in which we act as receivers to certain individual borrowers in IBRC.  We agreed at the time that when such cases come back to the credit committee in the normal course of events, myself, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Hansen - another colleague of ours who sits on the credit committee - would step down from the credit committee for those cases and would not be part of the quorum.  It was agreed that in such circumstances, the credit committee would assess them independent of us.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	568	I would have said that there were between eight and ten such cases.

A voluntary understanding has been reached with the bidders, two of which are Irish institutions that are subject to the code of conduct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	576	I do not know who the bidders are.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	578	No. I stated that of the two loan books sold previously, one was bought by a regulated organisation and the other-----

If the bids are allowed to proceed without a legal commitment in respect of the code of conduct and the Minister subsequently introduces legislation to require adherence to the code of conduct, could the bidders sue the liquidator of IBRC?  The bidders have opted into the voluntary code of conduct and are aware that the Minister will introduce legislation on the code of conduct.  On the grounds of certainty and the potential cost to taxpayers, should the liquidator not consider requiring bidders to comply with the code of conduct for mortgage holders?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	580	While I am not a lawyer, based on my experience in insolvency, the bidders would have very little chance of being able to sue us. There has been full disclosure on all of the issues the Deputy raised. For that reason, I am not concerned about them suing me or Mr. Richardson.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	581	This is not a normal liquidation because taxpayers effectively own IBRC.  The price is clearly factored into the voluntary commitments.  If the liquidators allow bids to be made on the basis that they will be required to comply with the code of conduct, they will flush out individuals who are seeking to flip the loans on rather than comply with the code of conduct.  Would it not be best practice and good governance for the liquidator, acting on behalf of taxpayers, to implement such a requirement now to bring certainty to the bidding process?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	582	Mr. Richardson and I are very comfortable with the process we have put in place. We believe it will deliver the best return for taxpayers.

On what date was the independent valuation conducted?  What does Mr. Wallace anticipate will be the return to the taxpayer from the sale, or will the IBRC liquidation impose a cost on taxpayers?  What are the current projections?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	584	I will answer the final question first.  I cannot predict today what will be the outcome of the liquidation.  What Mr. Richardson and I are trying to do is the best job we can to ensure there is not a cost to the Irish taxpayer.  We need to see the rest of the sales processes follow through before we can make a determination as to what will be the ultimate outcome.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	586	They have been above the independent valuation on both occasions.  In the first portfolio, 84% of the assets were above the valuation, while 16% were not.  All of the latest tranche of assets - I refer the €7 billion par value that we concluded contractually today or last night - were above the independent valuation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	600	That is categorically not the case from the information we have seen in respect of the valuations that have been placed on the assets and the bids that have come in. In particular, one gains a great deal of insight when one sees bids coming in from multiple parties on the same asset. This gives one a very good indication as to whether the value range for the assets in question was appropriate. This is something we are very conscious of in respect of each of the loan sales we do. As I stated, and this is as true of the loans we sell to third parties as it is of the mortgage book, it is of vital importance that we secure the best value for taxpayers and the creditors of IBRC. From the information we have seen to date in this process-----

Ultimately, this relates to people's lives.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	606	The timing of legislation is a matter for the Government.  The Minister stated that he would consider this matter with a view to introducing legislation, if necessary, over a period.  It is difficult, even if we were not involved in the IBRC liquidation, to pass legislation that covers existing contracts or persons.  We must take careful legal advice in drawing up such legislation.

If the Minister for Finance were to telephone Ms Nolan after this meeting informing her that the drafting of such legislation was a priority, how quickly would the legislation come before the House?

We all remember the shenanigans associated with the relevant legislation in the Dáil Chamber.  The consequence of that is the sale of the loans of 13,000 mortgage holders.  My focus is not solely on those mortgages, because mortgage holders with the Royal Bank of Scotland are in exactly the same boat and do not have any protection.  That issue was not the subject of much attention.  Ms Nolan stated that her only interest was to ensure Royal Bank of Scotland was not bailed out by the State.  I am interested in the citizens who hold mortgages provided by that bank.

For example, if a partner in a company that is providing advice ends up buying the book of an entity that is regulated by the Central Bank, Ms Nolan, as a senior official, should be interested. That is not my focus, however, so I will cut to the chase.Please correct me if I am wrong. The Government's stated position is that it wants to ensure that unregulated entities who purchase loan books from regulated entities in the future will come under the code of conduct of mortgage arrears on a statutory basis. Is that correct?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	620	I would like to reiterate what the Minister said to the Deputy.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	621	Could-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	622	The Minister has made it very clear last week, when answering the Deputy's parliamentary questions, that the reason he did not do this - and it was a decision not to issue any such direction - is because it could impact on the value of the book.  That was his primary concern.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	623	The Minister is not here to answer the questions I am asking Ms Nolan as an official. If the Minister wants to come in and defend himself he is more than welcome. He was invited but he refused to appear before the committee. The Minister can do that. I am asking about the powers vested in him. Obviously the answer is right. Now we will go to the point Ms Nolan has raised. The issue that the Minister has raised in terms of the potential legal threat is, as Ms Nolan has stated on several occasions before this committee, that if one was to take an action in isolation - at no time have I suggested during this thread of conversation that we take an action in isolation. To reiterate, what Ms Nolan has confirmed is that the Government's stated intention is to provide protection on a statutory basis to all mortgage holders, including the 13,000 in IBRC, that the Minister has the power to issue a directional order to the liquidators of IRBC to cease with the sale at this point in time. The Minister has the power to bring forward the legislation that he has already stated he intends to bring forward and if it is brought forward on a unilateral basis that does not specifically deal with this sale, then the issue of legal action is diminished or does not exist. If this is what we all want, why do we not do it? Instead of the Minister saying he will introduce legislation if they will not agree with this voluntary code, why not just issue a directional order to IBRC liquidators to stop the sale at this point in time? The sale was supposed to be complete by the end of last year but it is not. Stop the sale at this point in time. Let us bring forward the legislation. As one of the main parties in Opposition, I have offered to work with the Government and the Minister to bring forward legislation. Deputy Michael McGrath has put his suggestions forward in the form of legislation. If we are genuinely serious about not shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders why can we not take that course of action?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	624	I certainly do not think that selling the mortgage book is shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders.  I understand there is concern that the bidders - we will have to see who they are - may not do what they have promised to do.  We will take action if they do not keep to the promises they have given to KPMG.  I do not think I could count the sale of the mortgage book as shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	625	Okay, why do we not issue a directional order to stop the sale and bring forward the legislation which the Government has agreed to bring forward and then proceed with the sale again?  Why cannot we just do that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	626	I have just been given this note. The Minister can only give directional orders if it is necessary for meeting the purposes of the IBRC Act, not if it is necessary for the general public interest. So it would be quite difficult to justify stopping the sale half way through on the basis of legislation which he can pass after the sale is over in any case.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	627	I take with a pinch of salt the commitments that the officials and the Government have given in this issue. Despite the fact that the Minister issued a statement last night saying he will legislate, and Ms Nolan has reiterated those points, she has not been able to confirm to the committee that the legislation the Minister is thinking about introducing could affect the new owner of those 13,000 mortgages, whether the owner decides voluntarily to sign up to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or if that is sold on. There is no clarification as to whether such legislation could actually impact on the person who buys these mortgages on 14 March. That is where I take serious issue with the commitments the Government is giving at this point in time.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	628	My understanding is that we can issue such legislation but I have not got a stamped copy of legislation from the Attorney General. Until I get it, I cannot say it definitively. I do not work for the Attorney General's office. I would like to have a stamped copy before I could assure the House that this is perfectly okay. I have no reason to think we cannot, and I believe we can.

I presume the liquidators are on course to meet the targets for loan disposals.  How many people - if the liquidators do not have the number they can supply it to the committee or to me at a later stage - bought their loans directly from IBRC in the competitive tender and so would have got a writedown, and what was the overall reduction in those loans?  They may not be able to give out the individual overall reduction but across the board.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	631	I will finish on this.  The other issue is on the former CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Mike Aynsley, IBRC.  He is a joint defendant in regard to the racketeering cases going on in New York.  I understand the liquidators have provided a statement saying Mr. Mike Aynsley may well look to the bank for his costs.  He is still a company director at the Companies Registration Office in Ireland and may look to the bank to cover his costs.  Why is he not being taken off as a former director if there is an exposure to IRBC and liquidation of the legal costs of the former CEO?  Will the liquidators reassure the committee that no deal was done with the former CEO where he withdrew legal action against IBRC and liquidation for the fact that the notice period of one year was not paid out to him when his appointment was quashed when IBRC went into liquidation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	632	Let me take those questions in reverse.  I can give the Deputies and the Chairman a categoric assurance that no payment has been made to Mr. Mike Aynsley or any sweetheart deal done with him, nor do we intend to make any payment.  Mr. Aynsley voluntarily withdrew that litigation.  On the costs being covered in the potential US court case, there is a slight confusion.  The meaning of what was said was that we may have to cover his legal representation costs at the hearing, whether he is director or not.  There are quite a number of people named in that litigation who are not directors of the bank who may still have to cover the costs of that.  We intend filing an objection to that litigation for the very reason that there was a stay on all IBRC litigation in the US and that it would join us by the backdoor in that litigation if we had to cover all those costs.  On his resigning as a director in the companies office, that is a matter for him.  We have corresponded with him but that is an issue for him, not an issue for us.  We cannot unilaterally do that.  The first question was on the details of the loans bought by individuals.  I am happy to confirm the general details to the committee but not on the quantum at this juncture for commercial sensitivities because we are still in sales processes going down the track.

Ms Nolan alluded to the fact that the Department was given legal advice that it might impinge on the valuation if there was a stipulation that they had to abide by the codes of conduct. Did she say that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	645	What I said was that if we were to make it a prerequisite that it might expose us to legal risk.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	649	The State is always vulnerable to being sued.  The fact is that apart from the other creditors the liquidator mentioned earlier, such as some of the staff, suppliers and so on, there is also the question of those involved in the case the IBRC lost in the UK courts on the sub-debt.  Those people, the sub-debt people we burnt earlier, are very litigious and if they could find a way of getting the money out of the State, something they have made clear they want to do, they would do so.

They would have spoken to buyers in the market throughout the world who buy loan books and would have taken market soundings in respect of the interest in the various loan portfolios in IBRC.  KPMG would then have made calls to interested parties who would have bought loan books previously in other jurisdictions.  We would also have had a significant number of inbound inquiries, over 300, on our appointment or shortly thereafter, expressing interest in various parts of the loan book or in specific loans.  We collated the interest from all of the interested parties.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	666	Approximately 300.

She said the Government's position is that if the successful bidder does not adhere to the CCMA, the Government will legislate to force it to adhere to the CCMA. How will the Department know whether it has adhered to it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	674	Obviously, we will keep in contact with the successful bidder, but more importantly, if it does not keep to the CCMA, I imagine the mortgage holders will write to us.  That is normally what people do.  They will also write to Deputies such as Deputy Donnelly and he will write to us.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	675	Two loan books have been sold so far, relating to the GE money and the Bank of Scotland-Ireland loan books, to Pepper and an affiliate of Apollo. These have both said they will adhere voluntarily to the CCMA and I hope they are doing so. Is there any oversight of that and has any data come into the Department on their adherence to the CCMA?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	676	We are not an oversight body. The Department does not have oversight. If these come under the CCMA, the Central Bank will fulfil that role. The way the political system works, and it works quite well on this, is that if there is a significant problem in these areas, we tend to hear about it because people write to their Deputies and their Deputies tend to refer the issues to us. I could not swear we have not had any representations on this, but we have not had large numbers of representations on it.

The GE book was sold to Pepper about two years ago, in April 2012.  Therefore, this has been an issue for about two years and we have had unprotected mortgage holders in the country for that time.  Has any draft legislation been prepared during the past two years as a result of this, such that the legislation could be brought forward quickly?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	678	I understand the GE brand is still covered by the CCMA.

The trade magazines are saying it is down to Oaktree Capital and Lone Star Funds.  Oaktree Capital's own description of itself states it emphasises an opportunistic value-oriented and risk controlled approach to investment in distressed debt.  Lone Star Funds states that it invests globally in distressed debt.  If these two bidders, or ones like them, are the successful bidders, they are debt collectors.  They may be reputable and extremely respectable and professional firms - in no way do I suggest they are not - but they are not banks.  They are professional investors in distressed debt.  On the basis there is no written voluntary agreement, if when the successful bidder emerges it says it never agreed to adhere voluntarily to the CCMA, will we have any proof it did?

However, the unfortunate position for us is that if there was any instance during the course of the liquidation under which we could be held to have sold assets at under value then we would be opening ourselves up to legal action by creditors in the liquidation.

Moreover, I appreciate that some of his legal obligations may be entirely contrary to what he would like to do as a citizen. I altogether accept that this may be the case, that he has a tough job and that he has come in for some harsh questioning. However, there are a great many men, women and children whose futures are at stake. Therefore, it is our job to try to protect their interests.

Mr. Wallace is basing the recommendation all the time on the requirement to get the best return.

Let us suppose there are two scenarios, the scenario which the liquidators are going with and the scenario which I am keen to have evaluated against what is happening, that is to say, a scenario whereby the mortgage holders in some way get to bid. Has any indication been given to the liquidators on the estimated difference in total sales value from those two scenarios?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	713	I alluded to an issue in the United States recently whereby the difference in net terms of the liquidation was less than €500,000 but the judge saw an issue in what we were doing. At issue is a €1.8 billion par value book. I have no wish to make it seem unimportant but, from our perspective, whether it is €100 or €1 billion it remains the same principle in that we have not got best value.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	714	That may be the case for the liquidators.  However, from our perspective, as legislators, it is a completely different issue.  Let us consider the example provided by Mr. Wallace in which the difference was €1 million.  I realise that is not the case.  Let us suppose PwC did the analysis - I do not believe the firm has done it - and it came out that the difference was €1 million.  Let us suppose PwC made a stab at total sales value under the recommended process and the firm also did an estimate of the sales value under alternative scenarios, particularly one in which the mortgage holders are allowed to bid.  I hope the firm did this.  Anyway, let us suppose that total difference was €10 million.  We, as legislators, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, as the guardian of the public purse, could then decide to let the bidders do what they are going to do while we, the State, would make up the difference, therefore protecting any question of a challenge from the creditors because the total amount of money available to the creditors does not go down.  Under that scenario we could potentially avoid thousands of families being unnecessarily evicted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	715	That is a very interesting concept but the problem is that if I was any other creditor in the liquidation - there are significant other funds on a global stage - I would be knocking on the Government's door asking to do exactly what Deputy Donnelly has suggested for the mortgage holders.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	717	What we have been clearly told as part of independent advice is that if we went down that road, we would not deliver best value.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	719	The number is only a factor of the valuation and what we get in as bids at the end of the day. I believe asking PwC to put an exact number on it is probably unfair to PwC, to be honest. However, what PwC has is experience in selling loans books and the knowledge from the representations and all the other information around the sales processes in IBRC. PwC has clearly given us a recommendation that we are following.

There was some confusion because Mr. Wallace thought my question pertained to all mortgages but I was primarily concerned with residential principal private dwellings and so on.  I am seeking clarity because given the rapid fire of questions backwards and forwards taking in the import of what Mr. Wallace said has taken some minutes.  Mr. Wallace should correct me if I am wrong but I understood he said 60% of all mortgages he had were sold back to the original mortgage holder.  Is that correct?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	735	There are 33 loans which have been put out as individual loans for sale through all of the sales processes in IBRC.

They have been given the option to buy back their own loans and Mr. Wallace considers that is okay but he decided not to give the people dealing with the mortgage for the roof over their heads, their family home, that option.  Mr. Wallace’s decision is based on one law for the family trying to keep a roof over their head and another one for corporate and commercial interests.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	760	I was asked a specific question on Project Sand. There is a different valuation report in respect of each portfolio of assets we have to sell.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	761	I am talking about Mr. Wallace and the decisions he has made. He is dealing with all these portfolios. Is that right?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	762	Yes.

Is that right?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	764	That is correct.

Maybe he got advice on the other tranche of loans, commercial and corporate loans, from elsewhere, and decided it was something to consider.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	766	Correct.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	767	In the decisions Mr. Wallace made, one set of rules applied to people trying to keep a roof over their heads and talking about the mortgages on their family homes, and another set of rules applied to commercial and corporate loans.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	768	I absolutely disagree with the Deputy.  We have used a consistent set of criteria across all the loan portfolios.  We have not applied one set of rules here and another set there.  That is not correct.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	769	I just want to make this clear for everybody.  An individual home owner dealing with the mortgage for his or her home cannot buy it back but a corporate or commercial interest might be able to buy their own loan back at a discount.  That is the decision Mr. Wallace made.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	770	That is true of 0.2%.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	772	Yes, following independent advice.

We have established the Government is disposed towards bringing in legislation that will make these loans subject to the consumer code, the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and so on. We do not know when but it has indicated it will do so at some stage. At the same time we have been told that it cannot be a condition of the sale because it will impact on the price. I do not understand how we can commit ourselves to do something down the road, which presumably will have the same impact on the price, when we cannot do it now because it will have an impact on the price. Why will it not impact on the price further down the road if it impacts on it now? I do not get it. If we can do it down the road, why can we not do it now?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	775	I have already explained this. We do not want to tie any action of ours to the sales process because if we get involved in the sales process at all, we run the risk of leaving the Department of Finance and the State vulnerable to being sued by the other creditors, if they are in a position to make out that anything we did interfered with the value that went to their loans. Any legislation we bring in will apply to any mortgage book sold and not specifically to the-----

It seems to me there is another option. I understand the mortgages for principal private dwellings have not been sold yet. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	777	That is correct.

Is there any reason that simple amendment to the IBRC Act 2013 could not be made and inform what the special liquidators do in the sale of that book?  Is there any reason that could not happen?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	779	The very reason I gave a minute ago, which is that if we do something very specific to the sale of the IBRC book, we will leave ourselves open to being sued by other creditors.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	781	They will say the change we made changed the value and they will make out it changed the value far more than it did do.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	785	There is a connection if we interfere with the sales process before it is finished in such a way as to provide a legislative change that could possibly change the value. How much it changes is moot but that is not the issue. If we bring in the legislation now, the other creditors can say we took some of their value and can sue us. It would be better to bring in the legislation in a more general way that is not related to IBRC. That applies to all the other mortgage holders and would also be fairer to other mortgage holders whose mortgages have been sold.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	786	Is there any reason it could not be done?  Ms Nolan has expressed her opinion on why it might be better.  We can agree to disagree but is there any reason it cannot be brought in, that the amendment cannot be made?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	787	As I have said, it cannot be made because it would leave the Department and the taxpayer vulnerable to being sued by other creditors.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	788	The Deputy may not agree with the response or may have a different interpretation of the matter but the response has been given and I would like to bring this to a conclusion.  I want to clear up one matter and ask one question before bringing the meeting to an end.  In his presentation Mr. Wallace said that in total there were 15,734 borrower groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the six portfolios as described, 33 of these borrower groups, representing 0.2% of total borrower groups, having been or being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis.  We know for a fact, as every Deputy has repeated today, no borrower has been provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back his or her loan at a discount.  Did the 33 loans have a certain value?  For example, were they above €1 million, €5 million or whatever?  What were the criteria that put those people into that space?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	789	It was a combination of three main points: the advice from our independent sales adviser, which could have been PwC or UBS, the letter of representation from the borrower, and the evidence they could execute a deal.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	790	It was not the value of the loan.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	791	No.

There is a crossroads ahead for the residential mortgage book. It will either be sold or go into NAMA, regardless of codes of conduct, mandatory, voluntary or whatever. When can we expect that determination or decision to be made?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	793	We expect the decision on the mortgage portfolios to be made sometime towards the end of March.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	794	So come the start of April, people who at present are on the loan book, whether they are performing or in resolution processes, will be sold to another company or will be in NAMA.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	795	No, we will make a decision as to who are the preferred bidders. Thereafter, there will be a period in which they still will be corresponding with IBRC prior to completion. It depends on those who become preferred bidders but completion is likely some time towards the end of April to perhaps mid-May.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-26 00:00:00	Sale of IBRC Mortgage Loan Book: Discussion	811	The representations feed into the decision as to whether a loan goes out as a single sale or as a portfolio sale. Once that decision is made, anyone can ask to become a qualified bidder in respect of the actual bidding on those loans. Members should not hold me to this as I do not have the precise detail to hand but the majority of the aforementioned 33 are trading-type businesses.
